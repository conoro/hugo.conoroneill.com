"""2017-12-30T08:00:00+01:00""",2017 - The year of running 1000 miles,"2017 was probably the year I stopped feeling odd when calling myself a runner. I achieved a bunch of new things in running, including my first 50k, and managed to do just over 1000 miles for the year.

## Start running now

If you are thinking of taking up running in the new year, go for it. No excuses. Forget about ""I'll wait until I've lost some weight"" or ""when the weather improves"" or ""my knee is a bit twingey"". Go to a running shop now, buy a pair of runners in the new year sales along with a running top, running shorts and socks and you're ready (or just wear some sweatpants and a t-shirt). If money is tight, check out all of the cheap own-brand Kalenji gear on [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.ie/) or sales on [Wiggle](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/)/[SportsShoes](https://www.sportsshoes.com/)/[SportsPursuit](https://www.sportpursuit.com/).

Then start running.

If running alone bothers you, find a local [parkRun](http://www.parkrun.ie/) and get out every Saturday morning. Or see if there is a [Fit4life club](http://www.athleticsireland.ie/clubs/fit4life/find-a-fit4life-club) in your area.

Hopefully my 2017 stats will give you some encouragement. Well maybe not the speed aspect :-) Everything below was done whilst weighing north of 220lbs, 5ft 10ish and aged 48/49. So not [Eliud Kipchoge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2ZLG-Fij_4) or [Kilian Jornet](https://youtu.be/gGf3p6ZvRI4?t=55).

* Hoka One One Clifton - Love these. Fabulous cushion. A bit heavy. Narrow but ok. Great for very long distances.
* Inov-8 X-CLAW 275 - Love these. Perfect for boggy muddy Irish off-road running.
* Altra Paradigm 1.5 - Like these. Old. Treadmill only. Great cushion. Terrible heel cup.
* Altra Lone Peak 3.0 - Like these. Medium cushion. Good for forest paths and some road. Useless in full-on Irish mud.

## Weight Loss

7 lbs :-(

## Aims for 2018

I have a few things I want to achieve in 2018

* Run almost every day
* Run a lot more off-road
* Get good at running up and down mountains/hills
* Lose an enormous amount of weight
* Complete my first 50 mile Ultra
* Do the Chicago Marathon

## How to approach 2018

A final word to Brendan Leonard: [MAKE 2018 THE YEAR OF MAXIMUM ENTHUSIASM](http://semi-rad.com/2017/12/make-2018-the-year-of-maximum-enthusiasm/)"
"""2017-10-02T19:50:00+01:00""",A round-up of Conor's recent races. Lots to recommend!,"I've been having fun mixing up the length and style of the races we've run this Summer and Autumn. Whilst my speed remains atrocious, I find that my recovery time is getting shorter and shorter, which must be a sign of something. So here goes, June to September:

## Cork City Marathon
What can I say? It broke me again. I started so well - faster than last year and feeling strong. But yet again, as soon as I got to Mahon, I began to overheat and all the energy left my legs. I never got my mojo back but at least this time I had a strong sprint up Pana and felt totally fine afterwards. Mocko's win put a huge smile on my face.

I also have to mention the woman in Togher. She was standing there with bags of Haribo. I asked her if she'd been there last year too, as the Haribo had saved me then. She replied ""I'm always here"". I honestly nearly broke down in front of her. Thank you again.

## Ballyheigue Half on the Head
This was one of our last minute decisions. We tootled down to Ballyheigue for the first time ever to discover it's a lovely place. There was a big turn-out for both the [Half and the 10k](http://ballyheigue.ie/wordpress/half-on-the-head/). It was relentless hills but I loved it. Most of the views were great but there were a couple that stopped me in my tracks, they were so stunning. Definitely one that's worth the drive.

## Timoleague to Courtmacsherry 10k
It's ridiculous that this was only my second ever time to run this race, as it's only 20 minutes down the road. The previous time was my first ever race back in 2010 and that nearly killed me. It's one of the flattest 10k's in Ireland and I do a lot of my training runs here. For whatever reason I haven't been able to beat my 10k PR that I got on the hilly Bandon 10k back in 2013. Finally I did it down in Courtmac. I bloody loved this race. It's very rare for me to pass anyone unless they are walking but I powered through the last 3km and passed a bunch. I'll be back next year to chop another few minutes off.

## Clonakilty 10 Miler
This is a small local race that should get more attention. I thought it was just spot-on last year and was looking forward to this year. Of course I had a wee bit too much wine the night before and had a harder race than was necessary. I came in as the final man. I was really pleased to see some Fit4Life people, who brought up the rear last year, kick my ass this year. A bad reflection on me but a great progression for them.

## East Cork Harbour Marathon
[This one](http://eastcorkmarathon.com/) had us worried. All of the reports last year talked about the hills and the driving rain. But what the hell, we wanted to bang out another marathon. 

It was much smaller than I expected with only 113 entries in the Full. I had a funny chat with a guy from the UK who thought he had entered the Cork City Marathon. He was a bit shocked by the tiny rural start-line! The first half of the race was fabulous. I had no idea how gorgeous it is in that part of East Cork. I thought it was all ESB power station and oil refinery. But that road along the inlet from Aghada is spectacular. 

However this was followed by a few miles on the main road which was horrible. Cars whizzing by at high speed, thinking that beeping is helpful rather than terrifying. Then we headed into the back-road hills which were awful. I walked a huge part of this section. The final section from Whitegate on the main road was at least mostly on footpath. 

I was shocked to learn that there were 13 people behind me, given my pace. 

TBH, I don't see myself doing this race again, I just didn't enjoy it overall. But a route that was entirely along the water would get me back.

## Chiltern Challenge 50k
See [my blogpost here](https://conoroneill.com/2017/07/23/the-chiltern-challenge-50k-conors-first-ultra-marathon/). A life highlight.

## MMRA Glen of Aherlow LoopDeLoop ""Ultra""
Yeah, this one was interesting :-) We signed up for the Ultra on the [IMRA site](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1506) despite it being rated 10/10 for difficulty. My wife asked someone she knows about it and he said ""yeah it has a few hills but it's fine"". The description was forest paths and coutry roads. As it was 3 Half Marathon loops, I wasn't worried about it. After any loop we could just give up. Two weeks beforehand they published the cut-off for starting the third loop - 5 hrs 20 mins. So we knew going in that there was zero chance of us doing the Ultra. A Full would be the best we could hope for with 2000 feet of elevation change per loop.

![Glen of Aherlow](/images/2017/10/2017-09-24 13.53.39.jpg)

As I'm only just getting into trails this year, I've never done any of the Galtees runs. This was only the second time ever to be in the area. The Bandon Hillwaking Club Open Day earlier this year was the first. 

It was an early start at 8am outside the village hall of Lisvarrinane. 15 people were signed up for the Ultra with a lot more coming later for the official Full and official Half. But the nice thing was that we'd get a Full or Half time in the Ultra if we DNFed at the end of a loop.

The terrain was a lot rougher than expected but exactly what I've discovered I enjoy. Unfortunately my wife fell shortly after the start and got cut up. After a few miles she realised she'd be DNFing after one loop.

The very steep start was fine but the relentless mud and water and river-bed terrain made it extremely difficult to get any speed going. Once it switched to big forest tracks and a tiny bit of road, we were able to speed up. But my knee had been giving me gyp for weeks and really started complaining.

We were shocked to get to the end of the first loop and discover it had taken us 3.5hrs!! For a damned Half Marathon!! The RDs recommended that we DNF and had no argument from us. Later we checked the results and only 8 people finished the Ultra. But jesus christ the times of the finishers. I'm still in shock. The winner did it in 5hrs 22mins. I can't run that fast on the flat and they did it on that hilly mud-bath.

Buuuuuuut, I kinda loved it. So the following weekend I went back on my own. This time with poles and the route on my phone. I was chuffed to rip 30 minutes out of the previous time. But that's still not fast enough for the Ultra cut-off!

Side-note: I used the Lidl hiking poles that they were selling recently. I like the way they collapse down and they felt strong and light due to some use of carbon fibre. They worked very well over the 13 miles. However the handles are rough with too many injection moulding marks etc. I ended up with blisters on both thumbs. I'm going to wrap them in some sort of tape and try them again. But a total bargain.

If you want to try out the route, here's [the Strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/1186192545). You can load the GPX file into your Garmin watch or something like [RunGo](https://www.rungoapp.com/) on your phone. The views on a clear day are fantastic. But you will get very very dirty :-)

So the plan for the next few months is a huge increase in my hill-work. I'm happy with my ability to run downhill and run on ""gnarly"" terrain with poles. But I clearly have huge work to do on the uphills. 

## Next?
Neither of us were in the mood on Sunday so we bailed on the Cork-to-Cobh. There's a few MCI runs coming up that we're looking at. Then it's NYC baby! 

Last year I stunned myself by doing 5 marathons. If we finally do the Clonakilty Marathon (after years of Halves and 10Ks), then that's likely to be 7 for the year. I thought we might get to 10 but I'm enjoying the current mix. Generally I much prefer the trails to the road but that'll probably mean going abroad a lot more if I want to regularly do the very long stuff.

## Important Note
I want to do a big shout out to everyone who volunteers in these races, from the 5k's to the Ultras. I've never done it and I need to change that. I always make a point of thanking people at every aid-station in every race. Even with screw-ups like the water in Brighton, you should never take it out on the people who have given up their day to make yours better. I particularly want to thank anyone who has volunteered at an Ultra or who is an RD at a community event like all the MCI and IMRA/MMRA races and parkRuns too. It really is appreciated."
"""2016-07-10T18:32:32+01:00""",A year of running updates,"As has been the case so often over the past 15 years of blogging, I've been very remiss in my updates. I've had a ton of things I want to write about, like the Waterford Greenway and how adventure/outdoor tourism could be a much bigger business here. But that's for my holidays.

Today, as I move this blog to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/]) (what a journey it has had!), I thought I'd just give an update on my running. The last time I mentioned it, I had [just finished the London Marathon](http://conoroneill.com/2015/05/03/this-heavy-guy-decided-to-run-the-london-marathon-and-you-won-t-believe-what-happened-next/). Still a life highlight for me.

The rest of 2015 was quiet from a ""race"" perspective. I signed up for the [Dingle Marathon](http://www.dinglemarathon.ie/) and then chickened out and did the Half. Very glad I did, as I'd forgotten what a tough course it is. But it is still one of the greatest routes anywhere on the planet. Even the Top Gear guys agree.

The [Clon Half](http://runclon.ie/) was delayed due to the flooding, so basically I spent most of 2015 doing short runs around the town and on the treadmill and making no impact on my weight.

So January 1st lands and we decide to really push it. We signed up for the [Greater Manchester Marathon](http://www.greatermanchestermarathon.com/) in April and kicked off training. Things went well and I particularly enjoyed my 18 mile loop from the train station in Cork out to Ballincollig and back. It beats running 3 times around Bandon!

The Clon Half was re-scheduled for February and that was as tough as ever, with the added feature of horizontal driving rain. A terribly slow time but it was fine overall.

Then on to Manchester with 3 of us heading over. The race itself was very flat but also suburban boring. I found it tough mentally but physically I was fine and I did a sprint finish. The non-alcoholic Erdinger at the finish line was a lovely touch. The multi-hour disaster of bag pickup didn't affect me but left a sour taste in everyone's mouths. The fact that I could walk up stairs that evening told me I really hadn't pushed it at all.

Having done the Cork Half a few years ago, it seemed ridiculous that we hadn't done the full [Cork Marathon](http://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/). So we then signed up to run that in June. A few weeks into training and again it was time for the long run. And again the thought of 3 times around Bandon filled us with dread. So, what the hell, we decided to do the [Lakes Of Killarney Marathon](http://killarneymarathonofthelakes.com/). It's a small event with 3 loops of the National Park. The views were incredible. The day was boiling hot. I didn't feel great. The first loop was OK but up/down hard. Mentally I was in a baddddd place. Half way round the second loop I decided I was going to quit. So I kept going to the checkpoint, crossed the timing mat and started heading towards the barriers to leave. And then, the tannoy boomed ""And here's Conor O'Neill, about to start his third loop."". Nooooooooooo. The only force more effective than exhaustion is shame and embarrassment for an Irish person. So I kept going for another 9 miles. Pure bloody torture. I finished 3rd last. And as always, the moment I crossed the finish line I thought ""ah that was fine really"".

So we get to Cork. The third marathon in 8 weeks. What the hell are we at? I thought I'd only ever do one marathon! But I was feeling good. The cumulative effect of the training seemed to be helping. No injuries. 1.5 stone lighter than Jan 1st. But still crazily overweight. The race kicked off on Patrick Street. Within a few minutes, my friend Walter appeared and we had a good natter out towards Blackpool and then on towards the tunnel. But, despite his injury, there is no way he could run as slowly as me, so he headed off into the distance.

I've been experimenting with audio for runs. On short ones, I use nothing. For long ones, I've been using podcasts for many years. Often running podcasts too, to be very meta. But I've come to the conclusion that [a] I run slower when they are playing and [b] I find it hard to concentrate and overcome pain/tiredness/etc when they are playing. So for Cork I listened to a random ""dance workout mix"". And it bloody worked. Despite physically finding Cork gruelling, I was in a great place mentally for the entire thing. But the hills, jesus how did I forget the relentless goddammed hills? As expected, Model Farm was the absolute nadir. My feet barely moved.

Sidebar: I've been on various running forums and [/r/running](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/) on Reddit recently and I listen to quite a few running/ultra podcasts. And I've noticed a tendency for some people there to belittle very slow runners or runner/walkers. My guess is that these are mostly people in their 20s/early-30s at peak fitness who have yet to learn the real meaning of the word empathy. As their bodies age, they may start to understand. During the Cork Marathon, I passed a woman going even slower than me up Model Farm Road. As I approached, I realised from her back-bib that she was running the Half. Yes, this woman was on hour five of a Half Marathon. That's gumption. That's depth of character. That's someone to look up to, rather than snarking about their age/weight/training. So the next time you see someone shuffling slowly along in their runners, do what someone did to me today as I jogged towards the [Fuschia Trail on Seven Heads](http://explorewestcork.ie/walking/seven-heads-walk/). Shout ""Fair play to you"".

I finished Cork completely drained. That's the shakiest I've ever been at the end of my six Marathons. I think it was the heat and possibly screwing up hydration. It took me over a week to feel in any way right. 10 days before I even got on the treadmill. 3 marathons in 8 weeks was maybe a bit much for someone this heavy. But I'm so glad I did them.

The last three small runs were all in the past two weeks. I was in San Francisco at Red Hat Summit and did a 7 mile loop from Crissy Fields over the Golden Gate and back. Loved every minute of it and had perfect weather to take amazing photos. Then we had the Red Hat 5K Fun Run from Moscone to Embarcadero and back. I think that gave me a 5K PB, despite all the traffic lights! And then finally today I ran from Timoleague to Courtmacsherry and round the first short loop of the Seven Heads and back to Timoleague. I can't recommend this route highly enough. You don't need trail runners for the Seven Heads piece but it is hard on the ankles. The plan is to try some of the longer loops soon.

So next up? Well we're booked for Berlin and that's going to be a PB for me if it kills me. I think we have to do Dublin too, given the year that's in it. But to break up the training boredom we'll probably do a Full and a Half in August. All recommendations welcome. Not too far from Cork tho. Finally, I'll probably just do the Half in Clon in December.

And the planning has begun for an Ultra. Hopefully 2017. Hopefully I'll be 50lbs lighter. I'll probably start with a 50K to dip the toe in and then I'm sure I'll be leading the pack at [UTMB](http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/) in 2018 ;-)"
"""2017-01-22T20:20:00+00:00""",Acknowledging the achievement of Carol Morgan in The Spine Race,"I first learned of the [Montane Spine Race](http://thespinerace.com/) last year when there were some mentions online of an Irish guy winning some insanely long race and breaking the record. This turned out to be [Eoin Keith](https://eoinkeith.wordpress.com/) who is an amazing ultra runner. He had to pull out this year in third position after breaking a rib near the start. He waited 170 miles to do so :-)

Yup, the Spine Race is 268 miles along the Pennines in the UK. Only the toughest of the tough get to the end. The more I watched [the coverage](https://www.facebook.com/TheSpineRace/) last week, the more my admiration grew. These are a special breed of people who want to push themselves to extremes of physical and mental exhaustion.

Which brings us to [Carol Morgan](http://www.grough.co.uk/magazine/2017/01/20/carol-morgan-smashes-record-by-43-hours-to-take-womens-title-in-spine-race). She is an Irish nurse working in Leeds who has already finished world famous ultras like [UTMB](http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/). Carol went out last week and finished as the first woman. This is already an huge achievement for any human. Then you realise she was joint 6th *overall*. Then you learn that she beat the previous record by 43 hours! Finally you realise she finished a day ahead of the second placed woman.

![Carol's Time](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/spine_race_carol_morgan.jpg)

This is just a spectacular sporting achievement and everyone in the country should be talking about it just as much as any Olympic medallist. But we know they won't because that's not how mainstream media works.

&nbsp;

Carol appears to be a very private person who declined to have any video footage taken of her competing in the race. But I just wanted to say that her win last week is genuinely inspirational for me. I've never run more than 26.2 miles and I've never run more than 15 miles off road. I don't know if I'll ever try to do 268 miles, but if I do, it'll be because of people like Carol and Eoin.

It strikes me that Irish people are particularly suited to Ultra running due to the fact that we are all stubborn feckers. I think we're going to see a major uptick in this area in Ireland in the next few years. Far beyond Adventure races, Tris and traditional XC. The mix of run-walk that many competitors  do over these very long distances is much more manageable for a wider range of people. And it doesn't need to cost anything beyond some runners, wet gear, a compass and a map (I know I know, there's more to it than that).

Now to find my first trail 50k. In the meantime, I might see some of you at the [IMRA](https://www.imra.ie/events/) 5 miler [in Castlefreke](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1477) on February 5th?

"""2017-04-15T19:49:50+01:00""",All my current running technology,"The only thing you need to run is a pair of running shoes. And some people even get by without those. This is regularly driven home to me by the guy in his GAA top/shorts and knackered shoes who laps me in parkRun.

But if you read this blog you're probably a geek like me and of course I'm riddled with tech when I go for a lot of my runs. So this is my current ERC (Every Run Carry). I treat things like running bottles exactly the same way I treat my Garmin, they are both tech.

## Running Shoes / Runners
I have three main pairs at the moment.

### Altra Paradigm 1.5
The [Paradigm](https://www.altrarunning.com/men/paradigm-20) has been my main pair of shoes (along with the 1.0) since June 2015. Zero drop with incredible cushioning and extremely wide toe-box. Your feet will be immaculate after 26.2 miles. But the heel design is completely useless. They don't lock your heel at all and the inner material wears away after a few weeks. Also see my comment on the Skechers below. The weight of the Paradigms is really obvious to me now. But if you are of heavier build and want tons of sole between you and the road, there's nothing better.

![Paradigm](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/paradigm.jpg)

### Altra Lone Peak 3.0
See [my review here](http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/19/altra-lone-peak-30-first-impressions/). A more recent update is that I did the  [MCI Ballina Marathon](http://www.active.com/ballina-mayo/running/distance-running-races/3-marathons-in-2-days-marathon-challenge-2017) in them, as I expected much more trails. My feet were suffering by the end but they did surprisingly well for so much road. Overall they are great on rocky/gritty trails but far too slippy in Irish mud and bogs. I'm eyeing up both the [Inov-8 Mudclaws](https://www.inov-8.com/row/mudclaw-300-trail-running-shoes-yellow/) and various Salomons for the mud.

### Skechers GoRun 5
I immediately carved off at least 30 secs a mile with the [GoRun 5](https://www.skechers.com/en-us/style/54118/skechers-gorun-5) compared to the Paradigm. Even if it's all psychological, they work! They are featherlight compared to the Altras. Whilst they aren't zero drop and they have 10mm less padding, I adjusted to them instantly. The fact that they are cheap and available in any Skechers shop makes them even more attractive. I love them except for one thing - they are far too narrow. Both my little toes were shredded by them last week in the Brighton Marathon. But if you don't have wide feet, these are fantastic.

## Running Jacket, Tops, Pants and Socks
Most of my running tops come from the races I have completed. The 2016 Berlin Marathon one is by far my favourite and I actually got a second one, I like it so much. The worst was the 2016 Cork Marathon one which I recently described as a EuroSaver Barbed Wire Boobtube.

But my top tip for running gear is Lidl. I've worn through the crotches of two Lidl running shorts. I still use their tops and socks. I've never used their running shoes but they look fine.

I love the [Decathlon Kalenji](https://www.kalenji.co.uk/jackets-idfam3799) rainproof/windproof running jacket I got last December. I've gone up mountains in it and not a drop of water got through. I'm not sure if they still sell the exact one. It was approx €30 in their store in La Defense. However it's not breathable so you will pour with sweat.

I've a bunch of different socks including Balega, Inov-8, 1000 Mile and Hillies. If Jamil Coury can do 3 loops of the Barkley Marathon in $2.50 Target socks, I don't think you need to worry too much about them.

My main running shorts are [Ron Hill](http://www.runandbecome.com/item/Ronhill/Advance-Contour-Lycra-Shorts/32DY) and [Mizuno](https://www.sportsshoes.com/product/miz2497/mizuno-core-mid-running-tights-~-aw16/). They give me the least chafing over marathon distances. Both lack decent pocket space for gels tho. I also now use [Runderwear](https://www.runderwear.co.uk/) and of course [Bodyglide](https://www.sportsshoes.com/product/bdy4/body-glide-chamois-glide-balm-(42g)/) or similar. I've had zero issues in that area since I switched to that combo.

## Running Watch
I paid a silly amount of money for my [Garmin Fenix 3 Sapphire](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2015/03/garmin-fenix3-detailed-review.html). And I haven't regretted it for one second. At the time it was Garmin's most expensive watch. I got it because of the crazy number of features, the multi-sport aspect, the ruggedness, the 7-day battery life and the fact that it looks ok as a normal watch (albeit very big). I just couldn't deal with charging an Apple Watch every night. Over the past 16 months it has lived up to every expectation and the software keeps improving. It has Wifi built-in so even when it loses Bluetooth connection to my phone (a very common Galaxy S6 problem), it can still upload all data to the ""cloud"". It has only screwed up on GPS badly once, at the Berlin Marathon. Oddly, it had some GPS issues today for the first time in 6 months. Not sure why.

The new [Fenix 5](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/03/garmin-fenix5-5s-5x-review.html) looks like a superb upgrade but I'll be holding on to the 3 for quite a few years. The only two things it is missing are built-in heart rate monitor and the ability to deal with Smart Bluetooth sensors (I think it can only do Ant+).

In reality, the cheapest Garmin Forerunners are more than enough but if you have even the cheapest Android phone, that is perfectly capable of doing the job, using a range of third party apps (see below).

![Fenix 3](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fenix3.jpg)

## Heart Rate Monitor
I previously had a Lidl Bluetooth HRM chest strap but it didn't work with the Fenix 3. I replaced it with the [Garmin Ant+ HRM chest strap](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/15490) and it has worked flawlessly. It has been very interesting watching my steady-state running heart rate go down as my fitness goes up. I also love getting ""Extreme Suffer Score"" on Strava due to having my heart at 155bpm for hours on end.

The chest straps are apparently more accurate than the the wrist one built into watches but obviously the latter are handier and involve one less piece of kit.

![HRM](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hrm.jpg)

## Running App
I've used em all. And like most people I have settled on [Strava](http://www.strave.com). Not because it is necessarily technically the best but it has the most number of integrations to things like Garmin devices and it has the biggest community.

I can't really criticise it. It does everything I need and they keep improving it. I'd love if you could add photos from the web-app and some of the navigation is awkward. But that's it. The Garmin integration is great.

## Running Dynamics
Don't bother unless you are stats obsessed. I got the [Milestone Pod](http://www.milestonepod.com/) as it's fantastic value. I really only got it for properly tracking treadmill runs. It gives a ton of info about stride length, foot strike, cadence, ground contact, rate of impact etc. I'm just not sure I'm going to change how I run as a result. I also think it's 100% wrong about me heel striking. Possibly due to my weight? It uses Bluetooth Smart and works with Strava too.

![Milestone Pod](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pod.jpeg)

## Weighing scales
For the past 6 years I've used an [Omron BF510 scales](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Omron-BF510-Composition-Bathroom-Scales/dp/B001N064JW) with fat analysis etc. I manually transcribed the data to a Google Docs spreadsheet. I finally upgraded this year but decided to keep it cheap. The [Yunmai M1301 scales](http://www.gearbest.com/monitoring-testing/pp_332025.html) is absolutely brilliant. It gives all the same fat data as the Omron but without needing to hold hand sensors. It uses Bluetooth Smart to talk to a mobile App and uploads the data to their cloud. Unfortunately there is no web-app to access or download your data - you are stuck with the mobile App. I wrote a [Node.js app](https://github.com/conoro/yunmai-data-extract) to deal with this (saves to Google Sheets) if you are interested.

Obviously you could pay double for a Withings or Garmin or similar.

![Yunmai](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yunmai.JPG)

## Headphones
I spent years trying every type of headphone. The ones that have worked best are these [SMS Audio Sports](https://smsaudio.com/products/in-ear-wired-sport) headphones. No amount of sweat seems to bother them. The inline controls only work fully with iPhone. On Galaxy S6 you only have play/pause and skip. Like most recent headphones it has a right-angled jack. Which is a total pain if you have your phone in a sports armband. I've had to buy a [Fospower inline extension](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B016E5PEXC/ref=pe_385721_51767431_TE_dp_1) to make it easier to insert/remove.

I recently had another go at Bluetooth headphones. I gave up on the [Motorola SD10 HD](http://conoroneill.net/motorola-s10-hd-are-brilliant-bluetooth-running-headphones/) due to head pain. I'm very tempted by the [Jaybird X2](https://www.amazon.com/Jaybird-Sport-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B013HSW4SM) but I decided to get [cheap Anker IE20](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01DZXFB1Q/ref=pe_385721_51767431_TE_dp_1) to see if I'd like that style of behind-the-neck cable. And the answer is no. I hate having the cable move around on my neck and pull at my ears. I also only got 2.5 hours from them which is 3 hours short for one of my marathons. So I'm sticking with the SMS.

![SMS](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sms.png)

## Armband and Other Bands
[Belkin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0081EE9Q8/ref=pe_217191_31005151_M3C_dp_2) are the only ones that have worked well for me with various Android phones. But I have a Galaxy S8+ on the way and I think it may be too big for my arm. So I'll be trying to use it with this [FlipBelt](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01CH0CXQO/ref=pe_385721_51767431_TE_dp_1).

## Nutrition & Hydration
[Torq gels](http://www.torqfitness.co.uk/nutrition/torq-gel) were recommended to me several years ago by a friend. I still love them. They actually taste nice, unlike most which are disgusting. However they are pricey from the UK. Last summer I bought a ton of different ones when in San Francisco. I'm now a big fan of some of [GU's gels](https://shop.guenergy.com/products/energy-gel?variant=12137185921). Particularly the ones with caffeine in them. Caramel is a real fave. Their chews are also extremely good.

I normally just use water for hydration and whatever is offered during races. The warm tea in Berlin was a highlight and the Lucozade Sport in Dublin worked very well too. Recently I used some electrolyte powder in my water bottle on a training run and it was fine. Just not sure I need it.

I really like [this water Ultimate Performance water bottle](http://www.wiggle.com/ultimate-performance-kielder-handheld-bottle-carrier/). It has an adjustable elastic strap and a waterproof pouch for your car keys and emergency €20.

![Bottle](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bottle.jpg)

## Hydration Pack/Bag
I got a €10 pack and bladder from a Chinese site last year but it chafed like hell. The 15yo used the bladder in his backpack on some scouting hikes instead.

When I was in the massive Decathlon store in Paris last December, I got the [Kalenji Trail Running Bag](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/mens-trail-bag-id_8312245.html). I used it on a couple of hikes in [Ballyhoura](http://visitballyhoura.com/) recently and I loved it. I didn't try the bladder, I just used it as an ultra-lightweight pack with easy access to pockets for compass, maps, bivvy bag, GoPro-knockoff and water bottles. I've also just bought some [Ron Hill Soft Flasks](https://www.sportsshoes.com/product/ron1682/ronhill-trail-fuel-328ml-bottle-~-ss17/) to go in the chest pockets.

![Backpack](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kalenji_backpack.jpeg)

## Glasses and Contact Lenses
""Disposable"" shades from Lidl, [dx.com](http://www.dx.com/s/sunglasses) or [banggood.com](http://www.banggood.com/search/sunglasses.html) are all I ever wear. All are less than €10 and usually last a year or two. So it's no problem if they break, get scratched or get lost. I'm sure €200 designer shades are great but I'm not wasting my money on that.

![Cheapo Sunglasses](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sunglasses.jpg)

As for contact lenses, Acuvue Trueye do the job for me. The only time I really wear lenses is when I run. [FeelGoodContacts in the UK](https://www.feelgoodcontacts.com/contact-lenses/1-day-acuvue-trueye) are the best value I've found.

## Go Pro Knock-Offs
I've [already reviewed](http://conoroneill.com/2016/10/02/timoleague-courtmacsherry-elephone-explorer-pro/) the [Elephone Explorer Pro](http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_314991.html). Poor battery life alone means I can't recommend it. If I was serious I'd get the [Go Pro Hero 5 Black](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2016/10/gopro-hero5-black-review.html). But I'm not, so I'll probably get the [Yi II](http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_360137.html?wid=3) for less than half the price soon and retire the Elephone to dashcam duties.

"""2016-09-19T18:43:32+01:00""",Altra Lone Peak 3.0 first impressions,"Now that I've done my first trail race, it's time for my initial impressions of the [Altra Lone Peak 3.0](https://www.altrarunning.com/men/lone-peak-30). Back in June I got a pair of LP 2.5 in [Sports Basement](https://sports-basement.myshopify.com/pages/store-sf-bryant-street/) in San Francisco. They were supposed to be my first pair of trail runners but I found them so comfy they immediately became my daily shoes. When I went to get another pair in Europe I learned that they were about to be replaced with the 3.0. If you can find any pairs of 2.5, grab them, they are a complete bargain now and very different to the 3.0.

The best place I found to get the 3.0 on this side of the pond was [Accelerate UK](http://www.accelerateuk.com/shop/product/21/Mountain--Trail-and-Fell/Altra-ZeroDrop-Lone-Peak-3-0/). They sent me one of the first pairs they got last week. They look completely different to the 2.5 and TBH are a bit generic. 

![LP30 Clean](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/A1653_Orange_btn4_xl.jpg)

The main changes, apart from looks are a smaller ""last"" and a grippier sole. Whilst the 2.5 are a bit loose on me, the 3.0 is snug and a perfect fit with the usual Altra benefits of wide toe-box, high stack and zero drop. I was concerned when I did a short first run on them on the treadmill that my left arch hurt a lot. The insole at the arch seems to be very high on these. Much higher than any other Altras. 

But the real test came yesterday during Run Forest Run and they were fantastic. The fit on my foot remained great, the arch pain was gone and the grip was incredible on all of the surfaces. Just a warning that whilst they are trail shoes, they are not waterproof as I quickly discovered. Irish puddles, yay.

![LP30](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/lone_peak_30.jpg)

I know lots of other people have the same criticism of Altra that I do. I love their products but this sizing nonsense has to stop. It's bad enough that two of your products fit completely differently for the same nominal size, but when you are doing it between versions of the same product, it's just ridiculous! From what I can see, every review of the 3.0 on the Altra site is complaining about the sizing. 

So in summary - I'm a big fan of the LP 3.0. But go 1 Euro size up from your usual running shoes. Unfortunately no one in Ireland seems to sell them so, if they don't fit, you may be in the usual world of product returns cost hell that we suffer from over here."

"""2016-11-20T20:20:00+00:00""",Bringing the carnage to the Dublin Marathon 2016,"Four years ago I ran my first marathon, in Dublin, and it was a disaster. Everything seized up at the top of my right calf around mile 10, followed a few miles later by my left calf. I hobbled the remaining 16 miles in pain. It had never happened before and it hasn't happened since. 

I thought that was the end of my marathon ""career"" and reverted to Halves and 10k's until last year. I finally got the confidence up again and did both Tralee and London. This year was a bit nuts with Manchester, Lakes of Killarney, Cork and Berlin. But at the back of my mind I wanted to do Dublin again and get revenge for the 2012 horror.

Did it go well? Too bloody right it did! Not only did I get revenge, I got PBs for 15k, 10 Miles, 20k, Half Marathon, 30k *and* Marathon. I'm bloody chuffed. 


{{< youtube Km7o3w2fs5Y >}}
&nbsp;

Everything went right for me. I ran faster than planned for 10 miles then collapsed in speed as I always do. But a few faster ones in the middle and an very solid finish, despite walking all of Milltown, Clonskeagh and Roebuck, was enough to give me the result I wanted.  Yeah yeah, I run barely above the pace of a walker, but I'm happy.

* I'd like to thank the following:
  * All of our family and friends who came out to shout. It's an incredibly powerful motivator to see people you know.
  * Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Tommy Ramone for getting me through the [last 3 miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGgfHZ02I2k)
  * Andy from [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) whose calming dulcet tones popped into my mind several times during the hard bits. 
  * [Jim Walmsley](https://twitter.com/walmsley172?lang=en) whose interview on [Ginger Runner Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t33Zi7Pe-jk) kept going around in my head. He said he'd bring the carnage to Western States next year. I turned that into a little personal mantra of ""I'm bringing the carnage"". Of course in my case it was carnage on my body :-) But it really worked. Along with 26 miles of me telling myself ""I've got this"".

Couple of notes:

* The atmosphere before, during and after is wonderful
* The newer route is much better. I didn't mind the Phoenix Park this time at all.
* Drinks stations worked perfectly for me. Faultless.
* Like Cork, generic dance music seemed to work better for me than podcasts for the bulk of the race
* Whoever told the German runner I met that Dublin is as flat as Berlin is an evil person :-) When I told the poor guy going up Milltown that the two worst hills were still to come, he was very very unhappy
* The supporters were fantastic as always. More bands like Berlin and London would be good tho.
* I had far more chats than usual due to my Berlin Marathon running top. It's a great conversation starter for others.
* They need to rearrange the bag drop-off. Despite our hotel being 5 mins from the start line, I think we walked 2+ miles going to/from bag-drop
* RTE is a laughable embarassment. Did RTE Sport hide under their desks for the day, as we ran past their offices? Rather than live broadcasting the largest single mass participatory sporting event in the country and the fourth largest marathon in Europe? If RTE doesn't think that's public service broadcasting then it should be shutdown and give us all our money back.
* The Marathon should forget about the RTE dinosaurs and arrange live streaming themselves like UTMB does. Thousands of people watched UTMB this year and that's a tiny niche race compared to Dublin. With the right global promotion, Dublin could be a huge online media event.


If you are thinking about your first marathon or first Irish marathon, you should seriously consider Dublin. Yes, it's very hilly compared to Berlin, London or Manchester. But it's easier than many and the crowds really are superb.

"""2017-03-22T19:17:32+00:00""",Carrigfadda Hill and Warrenscourt Forest are two brilliant running spots in West Cork,"A few months back I was browsing the [Coillte Outdoors site](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/home/) for forests in West Cork that looked good for running in. The two most promising ones I found were [Warrenscourt Forest](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/index.php?id=171&rec_site=56) and [Carrigfadda Hill](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/index.php?id=173&rec_site=138&trail=217).

## Warrenscourt
I've done Warrenscourt Forest twice and I highly recommend it. You can access it from either the Warrenscourt end or Kilmurry end and both are very short drives off the N22 near Lissarda. Whilst it's quite steep in places, it's very runnable with some beautiful views along by the stream. 

![Warrenscourt 4](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-17%2010.54.44.jpg)

The only disappointment is that two nearby lakes are on private property. They would really add to the experience. It's mostly dog walkers at the weekend but I've met a couple of runners too. The dog walkers appear to be illiterate, based on most of their dogs being off the leash, despite the large signs. 

![Warrenscourt 1](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-17%2010.57.44.jpg)

![Warrenscourt 2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0108_100752_002.JPG)

If you need somewhere to crank out the miles in loops away from traffic and with a slight ""trail"" feel to it, I highly recommend Warrenscourt.

![Warrenscourt 3](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-17%2010.41.54.jpg)

## Carrigfadda
Carrigfadda is a different kettle of fish entirely. It's difficult to even Google it, as there is another one near Skibbereen. This one is near Reenascreena and is down some very small back roads. 

![Carrigfadda 1](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-21%2015.28.01.jpg)

Eventually you come across a lone church in the middle of nowhere. It's best to park there. 

![Carrigfadda 2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_143821_007.JPG)

You have to run a few yards up an open road and then head up a lane which becomes more and more unpaved. You follow that to an open area near a farmhouse and then the real fun begins.

![Carrigfadda 3](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_144629_004.JPG)

The steps seem to go on forever. Even if you are just walking, it's hard work. 

![Carrigfadda 4](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steps.jpg)

Finally you get a breather in the forest itself (a featureless generic monoculture pine plantation) but the steepness starts soon again. Did I mention the mud? So much mud. Lovely mud.

![Carrigfadda 8](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_145610_005.JPG)

You'll start to see a concrete holy cross peeking out and suddenly you're nearly at the top. 

![Carrigfadda 9](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_150427_016.JPG)


You lift your head and pow, holy crap, the views. A genuine gasp out-loud moment. I spent ages here and at the cross taking photos and videos and panoramas. The fog and rain initially masked the fact that you can see the Altantic from here. The wind turbines seemed scarily close and are a complete eyesore. The sooner we move all this stuff offshore, the better for everyone. 

![Carrigfadda 10](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-21%2014.59.34.jpg)

&nbsp;

I then started the descent. Slightly further down is a mysterious monolith (ok ok, it turns out to be a [trigonometric station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_station)). 

![Carrigfadda 5](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_151547_002.JPG)

Then I pegged it back down as far as the steps, slipping and sliding everywhere, and finally made it back to the car. Only 2.5 miles all-in but it felt like 10 with over 1000ft of elevation change.

I had another look at the map in the church car park and there are some other small spur routes I could have taken to extend the run. Next time.

I want to do lots more trail and mountain running in the next 12 months and I think I've found the perfect training ground!

Here's a link to [my Strava trace](https://www.strava.com/activities/908926017) for my exact route. There's also a lovely description of the [Hill walk here](http://corkhillwalks.blogspot.ie/2014/04/carrigfadda-looped-walk-over-high-hill.html).

p.s. does anyone know what has happened to Duke's Wood near Bandon on the way to Crookstown? It used to be a recreation area but it looks like they are cutting the whole thing down. The lack of any public forests near Bandon is a real let-down. However I must check out the tiny one beside Innishannon."
"""2018-06-09T12:00:00+01:00""",Castlefreke is exactly why all State lands must be immediately be removed from the hands of logging company Coillte,"Let's get straight to the point. [Coillte](https://www.coillte.ie/) is a logging company with a commercial mandate. Having it in charge of 440,000 hectares of state lands is so idiotically Irish, you don't know whether to laugh or cry. All state lands should be transferred to a hugely expanded and reformulated [National Parks and Wildlife Service](https://www.npws.ie/) immediately. The NPWS can then licence Coillte to plant and harvest trees in a strictly controlled fashion on a limited subset of those lands. Clear-felling must be banned and all planting must be of mixed species.

State lands belong to the Irish people. I'm not going to suddenly become a rabid republican but we have enough history here to make any attempt to sell-off Castlefreke Woods deeply offensive to most people.

![Castlefreke](/images/2018/06/20180527_132348.jpg)

The revelation that the owners of Castlefreke want to buy the woods from Coillte is no surprise. What is completely unacceptable is that this is a ""discussion"" at all. The answer must always be no. Always.

In fact, if Coillte wants to discuss anything with the owners of the castle, it should be to offer to buy all of their lands.

The area around Castlefreke is a gem of a resource for the people of West Cork. It is one of the only places you can walk and run safely for miles, in the woods, paths, lanes, beaches and roads. You can go from the end of Quay road in Rosscarbery to Galley Head with some of the best views in the world. The idea that a family or company gets to take some of that from us is ridiculous.

A few more examples of Coillte in action:

Last weekend I decided to finally check out Duke's Wood near Bandon on the Crookstown Road. When we first moved here, it had a big Coillte sign and picnic tables. They have gone or rotted away and Coillte has clear-felled a huge part of it. Signs everywhere say Keep Out. In the best Irish tradition I ignored the signs and went exploring. Despite all the briars and disgraceful clear-felling, there is still a wonderful little wood here on both sides of the road. A small amount of investment would make this an amazing walking, running and leisure location. With a 25 year plan, it could be re-planted with native species and deliver long term benefits to the area. Instead I'm sure they'll just clearfell the rest of it. Because they are a logging company.

Similarly the woods in Kilmurry/Warrenscourt, whilst not the prettiest, are still a great place to have a walk and run in safety. But of course, their only real function is to generate revenue for Coillte and the State. So they are in the process of being clear-felled too. I'm just waiting for the day they decide to go after Dromkeen.

Update 1: I've just learned on Facebook that the lovely (albeit steep) Carrigfadda is now closed to the Irish people too. Is Coillte intent on getting rid of every safely walkable part of West Cork? How much revenue is even generated by clear-felling a wood as tiny as Carrigfadda?

(Sidebar: In Bandon, pedestrians and runners still can't get safely to the Clare O'Leary Walk. Meanwhile, how much money was spent landscaping bloody roundabouts in Halfway and at the airport?)

Two years ago I wrote a very long piece on called ""[The Walkist Manifesto - From Greenways to pathways everywhere and the future of Ireland's health](https://conoroneill.com/2016/09/21/greenways-byways-hedgerows-tourism-and-the-future-of-irelands-health/)"". If anything, I've become even more convinced that this country is broken.

**It boils down to this - What are the values of this country?**

What sort of country do we want to give our kids and grandkids? One that has nice roundabouts and a few extra logging Euro in the government coffers? Or one where everyone has free access to an amazing outdoors filled with clean rivers/lakes, native forests, greenways, rights-of-way and an entire landscape they can embrace without ever having to obesely get in a car?

Oh and BTW, that latter country will generate far more revenue via tourism/recreation than Coillte ever has.

Castlefreke is just a symptom of a broken system. If any local politician wants to be remembered for decades to come, they need to lead the change to fix the root cause.

"""2023-02-13T05:42:00.000Z""",The Columbia OutDry Extreme Mesh is the running jacket I've been dreaming of,"For someone who runs a lot in bad weather, I've bought very few running jackets since I started back in 2009. But once I started running trails, I had to up my game. They can be summarised as:

* 2009-2017 Various cheap generic windcheaters 
* 2017 - Decathlon heavy running jacket. Not very breathable. Still use it.
* 2018 - The classic Ronhill Infinity Torrent Running Jacket with the chest pocket square. Still great.
* 2018 - Columbia OutDry Extreme. The original heavy one. Completely waterproof but too bulky.
* 2020 - Inov-8 Ultrashell Waterproof Jacket. Extremely light. Doesn't breathe. Barely waterproof. Stitching unravelled.
* 2021 - The North Face Flight Futurelight Jacket. Stupid money. Breathable. Completely useless in rain.

After the disaster of the Futurelight, I was on a mission to find something that was waterproof in Irish weather, light and somewhat breathable. Generally that means you're into the world of high-end Goretex with one exception - Columbia. I've always like the OutDry concept where the membrane is on the outside, so it never wets out, unlike most water resistant/proof jackets. But the older ones were a bit too much like heavy oilskins.

I read some good things about the newer [OutDry Mesh](https://www.columbiasportswear.ie/IE/p/mens-outdry-extreme-mesh-waterproof-shell-jacket-1988551.html) design but the price was eye-watering - €250. So I held off and kept checking various sites for discounts. Finally [SportFits](https://sportfits.eu/shopware.php?sViewport=detail&sArticle=163652) in Germany had it for a good bit under €200 and I jumped at it. I would much prefer < €150, but if I get as many years as I have with the Ron Hill, I won't mind too much. Note that the price changes all the time on these sites so be patient. Unfortunately Columbia never seems to include it in their sales.

![Outdry Extreme Mesh](/images/2023/02/outdry_ex.jpg)

I've worn it on several short to medium runs in rain and one 27 miler where it rained non-stop for several hours on exposed hills. In every case, I was bone-dry underneath. Everything after that is a bonus. It does the one thing I need - it will keep me dry if the going gets rough on the [Kerry Way Ultra](https://kerrywayultra.com/kerry-way-ultra/) in September.

Apart from that key result, I'm happy with every other aspect of the jacket:

* Surprisingly light but not as light as the usual thin Inov-8/Salomon/etc
* Bundles up pretty small
* Nice soft inner lining
* Rain just beads on the outside and then runs off
* Not very breathable but no worse than most
* Good pockets (unlike the idiotic TNF one)
* Good tight hood adjustment (unlike the old one)
* Soft material at mouth
* Velcro straps on wrists (again unlike the idiotic TNF one)

It generally fits true to size and you'll have enough space underneath for a few base/mid layers or one heavy one.

I'm just thrilled I finally found something that ticks all of my boxes for the bad days. 

If your budget can stretch to it, just get it."
"""2018-10-22T08:00:00.000Z""",Conor manages to get lost in the Galtees and only realises it later,"One of my favourite sights in Ireland is when I'm driving south on the M8 motorway and the Galtee Mountains appear on the horizon. At certain times of the year and day, it's breathtaking.

The 16yo and I had a fine time out there earlier in the year with [Bandon Hillwalking Club](https://bandonhillwalkingclub.com/) on their Open Day but I wanted to find out how much of it was runnable by someone like me. I see how fast the [IMRA/MMRA](https://www.imra.ie/) guys race around via Strava but of course they are a different species to me :-)

A few weeks back I finally decided to do it.

I'm always concious of being ""that guy"" - the idiot who needs to be rescued off a mountain because he headed off without even a jacket or fully charged phone.

So I go completely overboard even on the easiest routes. Hydration pack, Columbia Outdry Extreme jacket (if it's good enough for Eoin Keith at Barkley, it's good enough for me on a Summer's day in Cork, even if the hood cinches are rubbish), hiking poles, bivvy bag, space blanket, water, food, compass, paper map, multiple offline map apps on my phone, swiss army knife, toilet paper, power bank, whistle. You name it I have it. The only thing I'm missing is a tent, flares and breathing apparatus in case of a once-in-a-lifetime snow storm followed by avalanche. And that's just to walk around the lake in Gougane Barra (kidding kidding. Or am I?)

I parked at the trail head at [Clydagh Bridge](https://osm.org/go/esxIt90p) and checked out the Coillte signs. I chickened out and decided to just do the signposted route up to Lough Curra instead. To find my mountain legs so to speak. 

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day1_01.jpg)

One of my favourite bits is only a few yards long. It's the Lough Curra shortcut. I thought it was going to be some sort of hill-walker in-joke but it was genuinely a shortcut. 

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/loughcurra_shortcut1.jpg)

Basically the lovely [Mountain Meitheal](http://mountainmeitheal.ie/) volunteers created a proper trail where people were already short-cutting. My huge disappointment is that we don't have hundreds of miles of trails like this in Ireland. But then [we're back to my blogpost from 2016](https://conoroneill.com/2016/09/21/greenways-byways-hedgerows-tourism-and-the-future-of-irelands-health/).

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/loughcurra_shortcut2.jpg)

Overall it's a fabulous route with a really great track along a ridge-line you can actually run as a normal person. It mixes forest, very steep fields, tracks and rocky bits. The lake and the surrounding cliffs are very impressive. But it wasn't the nicest day and the cliffs freaked me out a bit. So back I trotted to the car and headed home.

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day1_02.jpg)

Over the next two weeks, I found a few GPS traces on sites like [Wikiloc](https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/galtymore-horseshoe-cush-galtybeg-galtymore-slievecushnabinnia-co-tipperary-15378478) of the Horseshoe Loop around several of the Galtee peaks. They were quoting 5.5+hrs for a hike. So I figured I'd be faster with some light jogging. I loaded up a clockwise loop into [Viewranger](http://www.viewranger.com/en-us) on my phone and re-packed for Everest.

Back to Clydagh Bridge and up Cush I went. Zero running involved. It got steeper and steeper. Then really steep just near the summit. I started getting freaked out. What if I fell? I'd be that guy. ""Stupid fat old dude dies falling down small hill - Killed by the Swiss Army Knife in his pack"".

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day2_01.jpg)


I finally edged around the summit with my poles and started the trot down. Then up Galtybeg I went. Tough but enjoyable. Windy as feck tho, despite the lovely day. And onwards to Galtymore. I was killing it even if not a lot of running was happening. The dry summer meant it wasn't just a relentless quagmire so I was very happy. 

On top of Galtymore, I took a bunch of photos in every direction. The various cliff edges totally freaked me out as much as Cush when with all the wind so I stayed very very far away.

Onwards.

I got to the top of another summit. I came to the conclusion that the default maps on Viewranger had the summits mis-labelled but it was no big deal as I just had to follow the uploaded blue line. After a slight course correction, I headed down that peak. But for some reason I seemed to be making little progress. Another 15 minutes down near another cliff edge and I realised I'd gone badly astray off the mountain and had to circle around the base to get back on track. Which I duly did. I was wrecked and a bit grumpy at this point.

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day2_02.jpg)


I summitted another peak. Weird. I didn't remember there being this many of them on Wikiloc. Onwards to the cliffs above Lough Curra and I knew I was in the home straight.

I wondered why the hell someone would build a wall in the middle of nowhere at the top of a cliff on a mountain. To stop the sheep throwing themselves to their death in despair at EU agricultural policy? The youngfella explained later that evening that it was the Tipperary/Cork border! Oops. But no passport control?

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day2_03.jpg)

The final trot down was long but great fun and the Inov-8 XCLAW 275 (sadly no longer made) were amazing all day, dealing with mud/bog, rocks and slippy grass with aplomb.

Into the forest and a final jog to the car. Bloody hell, that took 4:45hrs. So much for being a lot faster than the hikers.

Home I drove and uploaded GPS data and pics to Strava. 

![Strava](/images/2018/10/strava_galtees_01.png)


Hmm, that bit where I went astray looks weird. 

Zoom in. 

![Strava](/images/2018/10/strava_galtees_02.png)


Wait a second. 

Oh you are bleedin' kidding me! 

This genius went:

Cush > Galtybeg > Galtymore > Back to Galtybeg!!!! > Down the wrong side of Galtybeg > Around Galtybeg > Up Galtymore > Down Galtymore > Finish.

Yep, instead of doing a full 360 when taking all my pics on Galtymore, I did a 540!

I still cannot figure out how I made such a n00b error. I was watching the trace on Viewranger most of the time - I now figure that I was so zoomed in, I didn't realise I was following it in the wrong direction coming off Galtymore!

Ignoring my idiotic error, it's a fabulous loop. But I don't think I'd do it in anything but perfect weather as those cliffs are deadly and you could easily go astray in fog. Particularly if you're me.

I now have a [Moscow Thumb Compass, with L baseplate](https://www.all4o.com/moscompass-model-11-universal-orienteering-compass) (or Thumbpass as Jeff in work brilliantly renamed it) in addition to the normal Silva and I'll be using compasses + paper + electronics from now on. Next time I might even run a bit more.

With the weather worsening and the days much shorter, I think that's probably me done with soloing the mountains for 2018 - like I'm some sort of Alex Honold ;-) I'm still a danger to myself on anything but clearly defined trails (and even then....). But I'm looking forward to going harder and faster at them in late Spring 2019."

## MCI Marathon Ballina
We joined the [Marathon Club of Ireland](https://marathonclubireland.com/) last year and I've been very impressed by the number of events they organise. They have so many amazing athletes who have done 25, 50, 100 and even 200+ marathons.

On the 25th of February, they arranged 3 Marathons in 2 days in Mayo. We picked the early Saturday one and arrived on Friday evening after a lonnnnng drive from Bandon.

We awoke before dawn and headed up to the local pitch to get our bibs. 61 of us took off in the dark  at 7am. 

Unfortunately, I thought it was going to be mostly forest trails and wore my Altra Lone Peak 3.0 trail runners. In reality, more than half of each of the 5 loops was on the road. My toes were in a rough state by the end but not too bad.

The loop itself was lovely and the views of the river as you ran through the forest were gorgeous. I thought I'd struggle with doing loops but it was fine, particularly on the second-last loop, as I was able to prep myself mentally for the next one. 

![Ballina](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170224_171937.jpg)

I enjoyed mixing in with the parkrun people too.

For the first time ever, I managed to pass my wife and beat her by 30 seconds for a personal best time. Then it was into the clubhouse for sambos and hot drinks.

This is a really great marathon and you should join the MCI to take part in these low-key, inexpensive community events that happen all over the country.

The presentation to the woman who had just done her 50th marathon really touched me. 

The woman who talked to my wife about how she was doing all three marathons over the two days, whilst toing-and-froing from Northern Ireland, blew my mind.

## Kilmacsimon Rowing Club 10k fun run
Absolutely brilliant fun. Lots of hills but nice and short. If you are looking to dip your toe in, give this a try next year.


## Castledonovan Loop in Drimoleague
Oh dear, we really screwed the pooch on this one. 

Drimoleague does a superb job of promoting various [looped walks near the town](https://drimoleaguewalkway.com/the-walks/). Unfortunately most of them are on roads which is a no-no in my book. Speaking of books, [the book](https://drimoleaguewalkway.com/the-book/) with all the detailed info about the routes is as rare as hens teeth and we had to drive to the Centra in Drimoleague to get a copy on the day we wanted to do a run. The Castledonovan Loop seemed ideal since it was only partially on roads and they were very remote.

We drove up some twisty bits for a few minutes and parked just opposite the old broken down castle. Luckily most of the route has the usual arrows on posts. You just have to follow the right colour.

The first part was up some pretty steep roads with only 2 cars encountered and both moving slowly. It was good energetic running. It then switched to a small forest which was exactly the terrain we were seeking. 

Then we got to the ""trail"" bit. Or more accurately the bog bit. When the real fun began. 

![Bog bit](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017_0328_103326_027.JPG)

The day was rainy and foggy and they had lots of signs about not attempting it in bad weather unless you were experienced mountain walkers. We decided to be *those* people who ignore such signs. ""How bad can it be?"" I asked. We had a phone with offline maps, an actual map, the guide book, a compass, rainproofs, water and trail runners. The only bit we were missing was the experience :-) I figured being in the Scouts 35 years ago should have us covered.

We proceeded to stagger through horrendous mucky bog in reasonably thick fog for 1.5 hours. At no point could we run. I realised I was one of those assholes who might need mountain rescue to come get them. But in reality I was able to find each waymarker with no problem. If the fog had come down very thick, it might have been a different story. 

This brilliant sign did make us laugh. Here's an idea - maybe put the grid reference or GPS co-ordinates on a plastic plate so people might know where they actually are.

![Stupid Sign](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017_0328_102722_026.JPG)

Finally we came across a gorgeous lake and then a proper track. We were finally able to start running again and that was great fun. The fog burned off and the views were fabulous. We got back to the car after a full 2 hour loop (the book quoted 4 hours for walking).

I can't recommend this route at all for running unless it dries out massively during the summer. It was the same horrible bog I encountered in Gougane Barra before Christmas. Fine for hiking, rotten for running.

On a positive note, I think my navigation skills came on a long way!

## Ballyhoura and Seefin 
We spent a couple of days with the kids in the lovely [Ballyhoura Forest Luxury Homes](http://www.ballyhouraforestluxuryhomes.com/). The views as you drive in from Mitchelstown are just fabulous. We got a good deal on Pigsback for a big house and really can't fault it. Shops are a few miles away but there is plenty for smaller kids to do on location. They also have decent wifi and Sky TV if the weather is bad.

The 15 yo and I checked out the forest path that leads from the estate. It eventually comes out on the main road which didn't seem to be pedestrian friendly. Another big miss by Cork CoCo. This whole area is a mecca for active tourists, but as always, only cars are considered. As I keep saying over and over: join the dots.

We then drove up to the forest with the [Mountain Biking Centre and Trails](http://visitballyhoura.com/index.php/mountain-biking/) to try out some of the walking trails they had there. Wow what a fantastic setup for mountain bikers! The shorter walking routes were nice but the whole area is more focused on the cyclists.

It seemed a shame to come here and not try something harder. So once again the 15yo and I set out. This time my wife drove us up the back of the mountain biking area until the road became too tough for a non-SUV. We then took off on foot with our maps and compass. He was fully decked out in proper hiking gear, including gaiters. I just had trail running gear with long tights etc. We missed the turn for the ""official route"" and had to double back, but since it was on a forest road it was fine.

As with Drimoleague, then the real fun began. We started the trail up Seefin and immediately the kid sank up to his crotch in the bog. Much laughing ensued. His hiking gear proved a brilliant move as he wasn't wet at all. 

The route remained boggy as hell but more defined than Drimoleague. It then got so bad, they've had to put down ""sleepers"" which basically float on the bog and allow you to get across. The views from the top of Seefin are jaw-dropping. 

![Sleepers](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170401_172108b.jpg)

The route down was much easier on a rocky track and finally we made it to a small road and broke into a trot. This brought us back to the same big road I mentioned before. I didn't feel safe attempting to walk on it, so I called my wife and she collected us.

I was going to say that it's not the best route for running but then I discovered that it makes up part of the [Ballyhoura Marathon](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1229) which was on last weekend! I'm aiming to do at least the half next year, and possibly the full.


## Tramore
As my new employers are HQed in Tramore, I'm spending a lot of time there. I had no idea what a superb running town it is. I've been doing some enjoyable loops starting with the flat promenade, then to the tracks near the back-strand and then up onto the cliff road and up near the Metalman. The mix of flat and hills is ideal and I intend to go further and further afield as time permits.

![Tramore](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170404_073657.jpg)

## Rosslare Strand
There is a lovely route from Ford of Ling down towards Rosslare Strand and all the way down past the driving range to the smaller beach. Part of this makes up the annual Easter 10k but I just love the stretch as you get away from the dense housing area. It's mostly flat and you can do some of it on the beach if you wish. One to remember if you ever want to stretch your legs in Wexford.


## Brighton Marathon
The [Brighton Marathon](http://www.brightonmarathonweekend.co.uk/) was our big race for Q1 2017 and all training was really centred on doing it well. A weight loss of 1.5 stone was a good start in Jan/Feb/March and the switch to Skechers GoRun 5 really helped with my speed. 

The day was predicted to be hot but everyone underestimated just how hot. 21C might not seem too bad to non-Paddies but that is scorching for us. It was the worst runner carnage I've ever seen in my 10 marathons. People were dropping like flies and being carted off by the medics. I made sure to stay very hydrated but by mile twenty I was really suffering with the heat. It didn't help that the low point was down in a horrible industrial estate loop. 

But that's the bad stuff. The good and great is that most of the route is lovely and along the promenade. The support of the locals is amazing. Brighton is just gorgeous. And being able to walk straight into the sea at the end of 26.2 miles is one of life's greatest pleasures.

Despite the heat and my head not being in the game, I still managed personal bests for both the Half Marathon and Full Marathon.

![Brighton](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170410_121123_320.jpg)

Brighton is definitely in the ""one to consider"" category for British marathons. My top tips: [1] Make all your restaurant bookings weeks ahead of time. We struggled to even get pizza. [2] You can get amazing AirBnBs only a few yards from the prom [3] Uber was £40 from Gatwick but was £70 on the way back due to traffic. The train is only £10. [4] We went from 21C to freezing fog in the space of a few hours.

## Dromkeen Woods Innishannon
Whilst [Dromkeen woods](http://www.coillte.ie/site/dromkeen/) have been around since 1740, I only noticed the Coillte sign near the bridge recently. I knew it was tiny but I decided to give it a go last weekend. The main path loop is very short and has two good steep bits. But the real fun is to be had on the upper trail which is knotty and gnarly and all over the place. The bluebells at this time of year are also lovely. Doing all of those bits is only a couple of miles but a few loops would make for a good intense off-road workout. As always, watch out for the morons with their dogs off leashes.

The fact that this forest is standalone and not connected to Kilmacsimon, the Clare O'Leary Walk or Graham Norton Walk really shows the complete lack of vision for active tourism, health and recreation in Cork County Council.

## Great Railway Run
We were considering a couple a marathons for last weekend despite it only being 2 weeks since Brighton but some of my shorter runs proved that I still needed more recovery time. Then I read about the [Great Railway Run](http://www.thegreatrailwayrun.com) and figured 25K was very doable. As my buddy Walter said ""it's a very civilised distance"".

The weather conditions were perfect - cool but no rain. We drove to Carrigaline and took the shuttle bus to Centre Park road. For some reason I was nervous at the start line.

The route is just fantastic and I think I'll be using it in future for my training long runs. You obviously follow a lot of the old railway route and you hug the coast for most of it. The first chunk is also part of the Cork Marathon.

Then it's out towards Rochestown and Passage West, on to Raffeen, out towards Ringaskiddy for a bit and then on the back road into Carrigaline.

I found the entire thing mentally very hard despite the flatness but was thrilled to find I'd a new Half Marathon Personal Best! 

Definitely one to put in your diary for next year. 

And as I said in my post about the Cork Marathon last year, I continue to be inspired by the gumption of people shuffling along in their first 5K or 10K. I'm going to go all Facebookey now and do an inspirational quote from the brilliant Pre, Steve Prefontaine. ""A lot of people run a race to see who is fastest. I run to see who has the most guts."" 

## Next
Next up is the [Cork City Marathon](http://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/) and then we have to find a few more to fill the summer befor we get into the usual Autumn and Winter season of races. My guess is there'll be a few MCI ones which will fit the bill. I also want to do my first decent length trail race, ideally 50K.

## Next year
Next year I'm 50. I've decided I want to do 50 by 50. So a 50 miler before May 2018. Now I just need to figure out where, and lose 50 pounds!"

On the plus side, the rain came in during daylight hours. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's go back to the start.

Nope, nope, let's thank some people first.

## Thank Yous
* Elieen - The woman, the legend. Words like ""community"" and ""culture"" have become overused and devalued. She gives them meaning again. None of us would have had this experience if it wasn't for her.

* All the volunteers - I tip my bucket hat to you all. I hope I can return the favour in the future. Thanks for everything especially the cheers and the smiles. 

* Catherine - I don't know how my wife put up with all my dithering and my demands. And then we got to Kerry :-) She totally disproves the idea that family as crew is a bad idea.

* Fiona - Big sis was ready and waiting for me in Glencar with everything I needed including awesome tea and lots of high energy to get me going quickly.

* Youngfella - I never got his name but he caught up with me after Caherdaniel and lit a fire underneath me by saying we weren't going to make it. I had gotten lazy and was having a rain pity-party at the time. I started motoring for miles after that. I really hope he made it. 

* Seanie - Not just for all the phenomenal work he does for KWU in general but also for getting me running again when he told me I could make it to the finish in time. Even if he was wrong :-)

* Eddie Murphy - For cheering up every single person he encountered despite having the chronic shits for most of the race.

* The informal aid station people before Mastergeehy - What a wonderful surprise. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I left with a skip in my step and a huge grin on my face. 

* Everyone who toed the start line - We were all in this together. Whether you finished or not, your energy helped drive me far beyond anything I have ever done before.

* NPWS and the landowners - KWU can't happen without you. You are creating a long-lasting legacy in Ireland.

* Gav Judge - For mentioning how special running at night can be. A perfectly clear sky over Foilmore made the moon look touchable. And the stars over Caherdaniel were one of the highlights of the race. I also day-hallucinated which was hilarious. That wonderful art installation of carved stone ducks were in fact just random rocks.

* The three sets of people who were sure I was wrong to follow the Yellow Person signs that they were standing beside ;-)

* The people of Kerry! - Thanks for hosting us.

## But why?
I don't have any deep thoughts here. I'm not running away from anything or running towards anything. I never finished Haruki Murakami. If I'm having a mid-life crisis, it's a bit late. I just love running (ok ok jogging) and I love the trails. 

KWU gave me a chance to spend an enormous amount of time out there with my shallow thoughts, enjoying some of the best views on the planet, and sometimes dealing with a bit of temporary discomfort.

Seeing how far this old bag of bones can go is also intriguing for me.

I'm much more inspired by the John Kelly view of ultrarunning than the hoo-hah king-of-pain nonsense you sometimes see associated with it. All of the ultrarunners and mountain runners I look up to seem like the most humble normal people who just love running far.

## What I nailed
* Nutrition - Coke, Tea, Sandwiches, Koka noodles or potato salad at the stops with Tailwind/Maurten refill each time. Crisps and emergency Hula Hoops. I highly recommend eating a packet of Hula Hoops as you trip along in torrential rain between Glenbeigh and Foilmore. Mood improver x1000. A few Torq/Gu gels during bad times. I was never hungry but I also never over-ate. Everything vegan, of course.

* Water - I normally chronically underdrink and have had dizzy spells in several races and recces this year. I needed to use a filter bottle in the river before Lough Acoose to top up my hydraflasks and had to pop salt tabs semi-regularly too. It worked!

* Blisters - The thing I was most worried about after badly shredding my feet in a 100km solo recce in July. I taped up each toe and my forefoot with Leukotape-P and Tincture of Benzoin after treating my soles for a week in [Tuf-Foot](https://tuffoot.com/). Blisters only started appearing in the untaped parts of my feet after Waterville. I taped those areas up in Caherdaniel and the problem was solved. Only a few minor surface blisters were there on the Sunday.

* Initial pacing - My plan was to slowly jog the flats and the downs and fast walk the ups. The ballpark target pace was 15-17 minute miles with hopefully some faster ones on the roads and much slower above Foilmore. This worked well to Glenbeigh where I was only a few minutes behind schedule. There were a few reasons for the slow planned pace: 2x bouts of Covid, an ongoing hamstring problem and an inability to string together a proper training plan by stupidly doing Connemarathon, Surf Turf n Tar, Cork City Marathon and Run Killarney Half over the past few months. The hamstring was sore at the start line. By the end, I didn't even notice it. 

* Tiredness - A weird one to mention but I wasn't sleepy even once. I normally get up around 4am so the ""night"" is a bit different for me and not remotely alien. I had been really worried about needing to sleep but when I mentioned it to my wife in Waterville, she asked me if I was sleepy. I wasn't. So what would be the point of trying to sleep. Sure I was tired but never to the point of needing to stop.

## What I screwed up
A few core things were the reason I had to DNF. They were so utterly simple, stupid and easy to avoid. It's infuriating!

* Shoe lockdown - My fear of a blister repeat and a feeling that the Speedgoat 5s were a bit stretchy meant that I did a runners knot on them and cinched the laces down very hard to stop slippage. Never do something new in a long race! Even by Glenbeigh I was feeling discomfort in the tendons on the top of my feet going into my shin. Bit by bit it got worse.
  
* Walking - After Glenbeigh I got lazy and started walking almost all the time. But quickly. I had various excuses for the next few hours like ""wind"", ""rain"" and ""darkness"". This put more pressure on my shins and tendons and by the time I got to Foilmore I needed Voltarol and Ibuprofen. By Waterville they were incredibly sore. And I was now 2 hours behind schedule. By Caherdaniel I was in trouble. By Sneem, both walking and jogging were killing me. 
  
* Gear Change - The plan for Sneem had always been a complete change of clothes/shoes and a freshen up. But time pressure meant that I just switched out the heavy jacket for something lighter and swapped the SpeedGoat 4 GTX for Salomon Ultra Glides. This was despite my wife saying that rain was due. Runners, listen to your crew! I left Sneem refreshed but very sore. The rain started. And got heavier and heavier and heavier as I got to the top of the exposed hills before Blackwater Bridge. The lightweight Inov-8 jacket and Salomon shoes were both saturated in minutes. 
 
Between the leg pain and rain, my speed collapsed and my temperature plummeted. I trudged through the forest before Templenoe, knowing I was done. I had lost the ability to visualise myself at the finish line or even visualise myself in Kenmare. At the spur in the track that went up to the hostel on the N70, I called my wife to come get me. She made sure I was sure. I was. We let Eileen know my race was over and back to Killarney we drove.


## Should I have DNFed?
I have asked myself this question a thousand times. If I had knuckled down, could I have done it? If I had gotten to Templenoe, changed all my clothes, switched back to a heavy jacket and base layers and taken a bunch of painkillers, might I have recovered my pace sufficiently to get to the end (either in time, or at all)?

I'll never know. The only things I do know are that the rain got worse and barely let up for hours. And 6 days later my left leg is still in quite a bit of pain. There's also the small issue of the large red swelling that appeared on my shin and which was diagnosed the following day as cellulitis (bacterial infection of the skin). So I spent the week on antibiotics.

All in all, I think it was the right call for me. (But still.....)

I'm very disappointed I didn't finish whilst simultaneously being over the moon that I covered 150km on foot with only a sore leg to complain about. I'm also chuffed how the rest of my body is in amazing shape after a few days, at the age of 54.

## Ass kickers
I can't end without mentioning Yvonne Walsh and Eoghan O'Neill. I knew Yvonne was going to podium even if she didn't. Her down-to-earth approach to everything is an inspiration. And Eoghan, holy shit, we all saw that video last year. Now that's a comeback!

## 2023
Hell yes. Training starts as soon as this tendonitis eases off.

## Bonus Content - Crew Stop by Crew Stop
Hopefully this is useful for someone thinking of doing KWU. By the time I got to the start line I had reccied the entire course except for 2 miles before Sneem. I had covered many parts multiple times in recent months, including that one solo 100km recce from Killarney to Waterville. So I wasn't just ready, I knew where all the gotchas were and kept my wits about me not to go off-course. But of course that's impossible if you live abroad. So here's just a few  short descriptions of how I view the course as a back-of-packer.

### Start to Lord Brandon's Cottage
The first section is a doddle (or to use formal language, a piece of piss). From the racecourse on footpaths to the touristy bit of the National Park and up to Torc is easy. There's a a bunch of steep steps at Torc and then you are on to the Old Kenmare Road which varies from gritted path to some lumpy bits. After a few miles you reach a T-Junction. Do *not* go to Kenmare. Make sure you know the names of the main towns/stops. I met one guy who was standing there, not knowing which way to go. Turn right and you'll soon cross the N71 and then have more of the same easy terrain all the way to Lord Brandon's Cottage. The only things you need to worry about are hydration if it's hot, and mozzies.

### Lord Brandon's Cottage to Glencar
This section messes up a lot of people. And if you only recce the initial parts you'll get the wrong idea. Start with mostly uphill roads for a few miles. Then easy off-road. Some light scrambling and steep up/down on rocky terrain before you reach the road again. You think it's going to be road from then on. Oh no no no. After a mile or so, vertical up the side of a mountain to the highest part of the course, followed by steep rough slippy down. I've run out of water twice here. Then a fairly easy but long off-road single-track before you hit the road to Glencar. Any time there are similar signs pointing in two directions, you always want the simpler ""Kerry Way"" direction. So not the ""Walking Route"" or ""XYZ Loop"". 
### Glencar to Glenbeigh
This is one of the easiest sections. A mix of very easy forest paths and roads ending in a very steep slightly lumpy up and down through the Windy Gap.

### Glenbeigh to Foilmore/Rossmore
A very short steep trek through the forest followed by several miles of boring hilly roads. Then my favourite bit of the course. A long fairly steep trek up above the Ring of Kerry. The views on a good day back to Rossbeigh Beach and Inch are some of the best in the world. Unfortunately this was when I hit torrential rain and brick-wall wind. Once you get to the top, it's an easy undulating downhill on old track to the road. A few miles on road followed by a short trip past a bull(!) in a field and you get to Foilmore Community Centre.

### Foilmore/Rossmore to Waterville
<video controls>

</video>

The bit I'd dreaded for months. The bit I lost sleep over. The bit I'd effectively done 4 times but was still terrified of. 

A gentle start leads to one of the big splits in the route. You do *not* go to Cahirsiveen in the KWU. That's a spur. You go hard left off-road and up a very steep uphill. Then it's viciously steep up and down on some very nasty terrain for what feels like days. If the weather is bad, this may end your race.

Be incredibly careful with navigation. In my big recce I got turned around in the dark and ended up re-tracing most of my steps back to Foilmore. It nearly broke me. I was so tired, I even convinced myself that I hadn't gone wrong and the Russians had hacked all the GPS satellites.

This time I had a compass/thumbpass and made sure I was always travelling between South and South East. Finally there's a very steep rocky track down into a farm and on to the road for a few miles to Mastergeehy. 

But it's not over.

Make sure you don't miss the turn here as you're about to deal with more awfulness. A very steep track up to Termon's ridge. There's a laughable ""4km"" sign there which some evil person has installed. I think it's more like 14km. This is followed by a few miles of rough ankle-breaking terrain and knife-edge rocks. Then a never-ending but not very rough undulating route all the way to the road into Waterville. it's more mentally hard than physically, particularly if it's heading towards 2am like it was for me.

### Waterville to Caherdaniel
First few miles out of Waterville are on road. Then a nice easy single track which crosses back over the road twice. Stunning views during the day. This is a very mixed route with a very steep up and then undulating downs. Mix of grass, rocks, roads, forest and trails. Tiring but not particularly hard.

### Caherdaniel to Sneem
The first mile out of Caherdaniel is very steep and rocky. Then it spends a few miles on rough but ok terrain. There are a few road sections which your ankles will appreciate. Then a couple of very very steep ups which take it out of you. The downhills are fairly runnable. Eventually you'll come to the main road. Do *not* go out on it. It's very easy to miss the signs pointing down to a track which runs parallel to the road. This is a very easy section. Gentle up and down. Track, road and forest road. Finally a couple of road miles into Sneem.

### Sneem to Templenoe
This is the start of the Lite course. First few miles are a very easy mix of paths, roads and trails. Nothing too steep. Then there's an exposed hill section which is fine in good weather (not so much in bad) followed by a short road section and then down into gorgeous woods at Blackwater Bridge. The views out to the water here on a good day are incredible. This leads to big forest roads almost all the way to Templenoe, with a few hundred metres on the main road.

### Templenoe to Kenmare
This was the hardest section for me in the Lite last year. It's several miles of constantly uphill road. If it's hot, be careful with hydration. Eventually you get to the top and can run hard downhill on the road for quite a while. The off-road sections are relatively easy, if mucky, with one semi-rough rocky patch before Kenmare. Then the road into and through Kenmare.

### Kenmare to Finish
The hill out of Kenmare is a heartbreaker. It's long and steep but at least it's on-road. You get a brief respite and then you are on to the Old Kenmare Road trail and it gets even steeper. You now have a lovely bunch of miles on a great trail. It's wide, often lumpy, not remotely dangerous or particularly exposed and ever changing. And eventually you'll come back to the T-Junction you were on many hours previously. You turn right and head back down into Killarney via Torc and the Park.

## Bonus Content- DNFer Gear
I completely overpacked extra clothes and shoes and food but I'm glad I did. It meant I never worried about not having exactly what I wanted at any crew stop. Here's some of the more important elements along with some of the backup/unused things in the boxes.

</video>

* *Hoka Speedgoat 5* - Initial tests were disappointing as I slid around inside them. Bulkier socks, foot taping and lace lockdown meant they were fantastic from Killarney to Foilmore. Never slipped once.

* *Hoka Speedgoat 4 GTX* - Much heavier than non-GTX but absolutely perfect from Folimore to Sneem. Feet 100% dry the entire way and all of the taping stayed stuck. Never slipped once. Sore on the back of my heel going uphill tho, due to much bulkier heel counter.

* *Salomon Ultraglide* - These were supposed to be the comfy option for me to cruise from Sneem to Killarney. Instead they were used for wading through impromptu streams. I've done a few runs in them and they are good but I don't feel as confident on the slippy stuff in them. 

* *The North Face Futurelight jacket* - I got this for half-price luckily. Fine for light rain and wind. Utterly useless after maybe 30 minutes of medium heavy rain. Don't believe any review that doesn't include bad weather testing. Avoid.

* *Columbia Outdry Extreme jacket* - Borrowed. Fantastic in heavy rain but a bit of a bin-bag when you're sweating. Buying one soon for the bad stuff in 2023.

* *Inov-8 Ultrashell jacket* - Basically a windcheater that can handle drizzle. Might meet minimum standards for races but is really only a backup on short good-weather runs.

* *Petzl Swift RL headlamp* - Incredible beam even on the middle setting. Made the section above Foilmore much much easier. But disappointed with the battery life and it can't take AAAs as a backup. So either pay €50 for a second battery or bring two torches if you are slow like me. It's also disappointingly micro-USB. So I often just bring one USB-C cable with a Garmin adapter and micro-USB adapter with me.

* *Nitecore UT27 headlamp* - This has a rechargeable LiPo battery and can also take AAAs. Two beams (narrow and wide). Good torch but half the lumens of the Petzl so I used it at the start line and towards dawn. However, I can't really recommend it as the hinge clasp is so weak, both sides broke with normal use and it's now held together with duct tape. Despite being under warranty, I have to pay P&P to get it replaced. 

* *Multiple Decathlon baselayers* - All good, particularly the skiing and merino ones.

* *Feetures socks* - Along with Balega, still my favourite socks.

* *Black Diamond Distance Carbon FLZ poles* - One of my all-time best purchases. Light as a feather. 

* *Salomon Adv Skin 12 pack* - There's a reason this is the pack most people were wearing. Cannot fault it, particularly the multiple pole-holding options. I had to watch [Dom Granger's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQASNVEq6aI) to figure that aspect out tho.

* *Salomon soft flasks long neck* - I've had these for a few years. Make sure to get the hard-bottomed ones to make it easier to get them in and out.

* *Salomon 1.5L Bladder* - Fiddly to refill when you're tired but worked perfectly.

* *Ron Hill Hydraflasks long neck* - Went blue in the face trying to get the liquid into my mouth. Terrible. Avoid.

* *Katadyn BeFree Filter 1L* - Has saved my ass multiple times on the trails when I ran out of water. Always bring it with me now. Any stream anywhere and you can safely drink.

* *Patagonia Endless Run Shorts* - I was gutted to discover that my fave Salomon trail shorts are no longer made so I tried the well-reviewed Patagonias recently. Love these. Particularly the big stretchy pockets everywhere for gels etc. Zero chafing after 80km.

* *Odlo Ceramiwarm long tights* - Used these from Foilmore onwards. Warm, tight and comfy. Did the job well.

* *OMM Kamleika waterproof pants* - Nice and stretchy. Easyish to get on but not after 24hrs on the course.

* *Arm Sleeves* - Any brand. Highly recommend these for the start instead of wearing a bunch of warm stuff that you have to stop and remove after a few miles. Also work well as sweat bands on your wrists once you warm up.

* *Garmin Forerunner 955 watch* - Still angry at this. Bought recently to replace 5yr old 935 whose battery had become very poor. It ended the run in Waterville when we plugged the charger in! I switched to basic Trail-run mode and it started announcing every mile at full volume on my phone! So I shut it off. Again don't use anything new unless you've tested it a lot beforehand.

* *Jungle Formula insect repellent* - I got swarmed by thousands of mozzies at Lord Brandon's Cottage. It was freaky. My entire lower legs covered. I still have all the bites. Once I covered myself in Jungle Formula, it didn't happen again.

### Update 1: Ultrarunning doesn't have to be expensive
I'm very aware that my kit list above makes ultrarunning look like an expensive pastime. It absolutely doesn't have to be. Shoes are the one piece of gear where I'd stick with Hoka/Salomon/Saucony/etc. My main money-saving top tip is to keep an eye on running shoe reviews on YouTube to see when new models are coming out. My faves are [Seth James DeMoor](https://www.youtube.com/c/SethDeMoor), [Believe in the Run](https://www.youtube.com/c/Believeintherun), [FOD Runner](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheFODRunner), [Run4Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/c/Run4Adventure) and [The Ginger Runner](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheGingerRunner). You should then be able to nab the older model for huge discounts. I've got plenty of half-price shoes. Ditto massive sales by companies like Nike just after Christmas. But remember that Aoife Mundow won KWU on her first go, wearing road shoes that she got as a prize in a competition! 
 
Ideally tho, buy your first shoes locally if you can, as sizing can sometimes be weird with some brands (looking at you Inov-8). And do not buy from Amazon as there are tons of scammers on there selling shoes. Alltricks in France is great as an online option. And plenty of sports shops around Europe will ship to Ireland inexpensively. UK is obviously problematic now.  

Apart from the shoes, you can get great discounts on other gear from local shops by keeping an eye out. And obviously there is a ton of good quality cheap kit on Decathlon. 

Many of the items I have are not absolutely necessary. e.g. lots of runners don't like poles and a running watch can easily be replaced by your phone. But remember most ultras have a mandatory gear list, so you can't dodge having a jacket with minimum specs etc. And you can't run any IMRA/MMRA race without a waterproof jacket.

As for the races themselves, whilst some have very high entry fees, that does not apply to any IMRA/MMRA race or the KWU itself.

So go on, give it a go. I bet you'll enjoy it."

"""2018-03-17T09:49:50+01:00""",I'm more excited about Eoin Keith doing the Barkley Marathons than I am about my first 50 miler,"Like many people I've been enthralled by [Eoin Keith's](https://eoinkeith.wordpress.com/) Ultra running exploits since I first discovered this crazy sport. Whether it's his [Spine Race](https://thespinerace.com/) wins in crazy weather or his FKT from Mizen to Malin, he makes you want to push yourself and try things.

My wife and I are doing the Liverpool to Manchester 50 Mile Ultra very soon (oh god it really is very very soon) and we flip-flop between terror and huge excitement over the adventure. It's her first run further than a marathon (but she has 22 of those) and my first further than 50k. I've thought about little else for the past few months.

Again, like many people, one of the main triggers for us being interested in MUT (Mountain Ultra Trail) Running was the wonderful documentary [""The Barkley Marathons: The Race That Eats Its Young""](http://barkleymovie.com/). Anyone who visits us overnight is forced to watch it and is always shocked by how much they enjoy it.
{{< youtube 79IUKC9gS-8 >}}
&nbsp;

It's not just that it's considered one of the hardest races in the world, it's the wonderful mythology that's built up around it which makes it so exciting. That's mostly due to the personality of Gary Cantrell (aka Lazarus Lake) who organises several unusual and special races. In addition to Barkley, check out [Big's Backyard Ultra](https://trailrunnermag.com/people/culture/bigs-backyard-ultra-a-race-with-no-end.html), [A Race for The Ages](https://runsignup.com/Race/TN/Manchester/ARacefortheAges) and the 500km [Vol State Road Race](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=40620).

Despite the various documentaries and YouTube clips, none of us have any idea how difficult it must be for the competitors. We've only seen the start/finish line and a few famous places like the prison, the tower or ratjaw. But the fact that some of the toughest competitors in the world give up after one loop of five gives you some idea of what they are going through.

Once Barkley grabs you and you begin following various Ultra runners on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and blogs, you discover people like Jamil Coury, The Ginger Runner, John Kelly and Gary Robbins. Jam-Jam has done Barkley a few times but never finished. He's going again this year. [Follow his vlog](https://www.youtube.com/user/runsteepgethigh/videos). Gary, oh god Gary. If you don't know his story, go over to The Ginger Runner site and give Ethan a few quid and watch [""Where Dreams go to die""](https://wheredreamsgotodie.com/).
{{< youtube xgWejm_hbpA >}}
&nbsp;

Gary is also going to be back this year. You should [follow his vlog](https://www.youtube.com/user/robbinsg/videos) too.

Then yesterday [Eoin announced](https://eoinkeith.wordpress.com/2018/03/16/the-big-target-for-2018/) that he's doing Barkley this year. OMFG. I'm struggling to contain my excitement about this. Over the past 22 years, only 15 people have finished the race. No Irish person has. I'm not even sure an Irish person has taken part.

I think Eoin will finish. Not just because he's an amazing athlete who has the mental toughness to see it through, but also because he comes across as a very intelligent runner who won't make silly mistakes.

The only thing that could make this year's race more perfect is if [Carol Morgan](http://outsider.ie/challenges/carol-morgan-ultrarunner/) was competing too. No woman has ever finished Barkley. I can immediately think of two who could - [Amelia Boone](http://ameliabooneracing.com/) and Carol. I'd love to see them both try.

I know I'll be checking the news about his progress as he works his way around Frozen Head State Park. Possibly even whilst I'm out on my 50 mile cake-walk :-) Today I learned a new phrase: ""botanical pace"". That'll be us. I may have to put a temporary halt to my boycott of Twitter to follow [#BM100](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BM100) over the weekend.

Update 1: I just listened to [Ethan's excellent interview with Jamil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy4p__budj4) from last week. A lot of it covers his prep and hopes for Barkley. They also mentioned that Guillaume Calmettes [who won Big's Backyard Ultra 2017](https://ultrarunning.com/featured/one-more-hour-guillaume-calmettes-245-832-miles-at-big-dog-backyard-ultra/) is doing Barkley and you can see how much he has prepared [on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1356533).

Update 2: The race is underway and Eoin has finished one loop. But I also just discovered that [Stephanie Case](https://ultrarunnergirl.com/) and [Maggie Guterl](https://twitter.com/maggatronruns?lang=en) are running too. If I'd known that, I'd obviously have included them in the growing list of ""bad-ass women who can totally finish Barkley"". Fingers crossed for them all, it sounds like the weather conditions are horrendous.

Update 3: Well Barkleys 2018 is over and *no one* finished it! Unbelievably bad conditions meant that only one person even managed the fun run (Gary Robbins).
{{< youtube bT2fVKpT5A8 >}}
&nbsp;

What an amazing effort by everyone. One of the last people out on the course, but DNFed, was Guillaume Calmettes. I listened to a [superb Billy Yang podcast](http://billyyangpodcast.libsyn.com/guillaume-calmettes-byp-011) interview with him yesterday, driving home, whilst the race was still on. Give it a listen. He'll be running [Last One Standing](https://www.sientries.co.uk/event.php?elid=Y&event_id=4476) in Florence Court in Northern Ireland in September.

I can't wait to read Eoin's Barkley race report whenever his broken shoulder heals. I still think he's the man to finish it in 2019.

Update 4: A [set of short videos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Eoin-Keith-Athlete-1180273035349427/videos/) have been uploaded to Eoin's Facebook account. And I almost missed [Alexis Berg's](https://www.instagram.com/alexis_berg/) new video about Barkley as I thought it was in French! [La Barkley Sans Pitié](https://www.lequipe.fr/explore-video/020-la-barkley-sans-pitie/) is really worth a watch.

But they both really came up trumps with [my EI123 blogpost](https://conoroneill.com/2018/10/15/flight-ei123-and-the-death-of-the-aer-lingus-brand/).

![Leprechaun Airlines](/images/2018/10/leprechaun_airlines.jpg)

Unsurprisingly it turns out that IAG airlines have been treating passengers like garbage all over Europe and they are getting worse by the day. I received a large number of stories both publicly and privately that show a company which seems to detest the people who keep them in business.

The only contact I had from Aer Lingus was from a clearly under-resourced Head of Social Media. He was very helpful and ensured our statutory compensation claim was expedited. Others who didn't make my level of noise are still waiting for their claim to be processed.

## Go Shannon Go

The main positive outcome for me was re-discovering Shannon airport via several recommendations. Despite the horrible N20 drive (which is actually not too bad early on a Sunday morning), every other aspect of getting to/from Raleigh was fantastic. A one minute walk from the car to the terminal. No queue in security. Maybe 10 people in the Pre-Clearance queue. Nice flight via United to Newark which has improved immensely since I was last there in 1998. The onward flight to Raleigh took much less time than quoted. On the return leg, I barely waited 5 minutes for my bag in Shannon. Then on the road to Cork in another 2 minutes.

I can't recommend Shannon highly enough. I heard a United flight attendant telling a passenger that the Newark route had been a huge success for them this year. Unfortunately it is shutting down for the winter. So Shannon is clearly still heavily reliant on tourism traffic. Given the number of people talking about avoiding Dublin at all costs when on both flights, the airlines in Shannon need to promote it more for business travel. And roll on the M20.

## Show me the numbers

This was the bit that really shocked me. Whilst I still have plenty of followers on Twitter despite my absence, I barely ever use LinkedIn and didn't expect much of a response. Ditto Facebook. Boy was I wrong about LinkedIn!!

So here are the raw numbers:

### Blog post itself

The stat that blew my mind here was the average time spent reading [the post](https://conoroneill.com/2018/10/15/flight-ei123-and-the-death-of-the-aer-lingus-brand/). In the first few days it was 12 minutes! I struggle to read anything longer than about 5 minutes so thank you all for your attention! A lesson for media outlets that when people care about what they are reading, they stay engaged. Also you should curse more.

![Google Analytics](/images/2018/10/ga_stats.png)

### Twitter

I started [with Twitter](https://twitter.com/conoro/status/1051735571201253377) and found it interesting that, despite few retweets, the views just kept on coming. They are just about to hit 10,000.

![Twitter](/images/2018/10/twitter_stats.png)

### Facebook

Facebook [saw little interaction](https://www.facebook.com/conoroneill/posts/656591949943) but the 12 shares included some very influential people (thanks Frank!), which means it drove similar levels of traffic to the blog as the others.

![Facebook](/images/2018/10/facebook_stats.png)

### LinkedIn - The site that keeps on giving

Wow. [Just wow](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6457894659648733184). Not only is it about to go over 15,000 views, 487 of them are from CEOs or equivalent level. It also seems to have been shared privately by many, as I was contacted by multiple people I don't know to tell me similar stories of horror from IAG companies. Including one person who was on the original EI123 but managed to escape via another airline to Chicago.

![LinkedIn](/images/2018/10/linkedin_stats.png)

I've also had several people tell me that they continue to see the post via their contacts. It's extremely interesting that in a social media world with the attention span of a goldfish, my post has had some longevity. People are clearly sick to death of IAG's behavior.

That's the first thing I've ever written where the majority of the traffic came from LinkedIn instead of Twitter.

![Google Analytics](/images/2018/10/ga_stats_02.png)

### Others

I'm sure I could drive another bunch of traffic to the site if I posted it to boards.ie or Reddit. I might still. I even half-jokingly considered using some of our compo to pay for a Promoted Tweet campaign. But it didn't look like very good value.

## Final words

I don't know if there is anyone in Aer Lingus who thinks that great customer service can be a differentiator. It's quite clear from everything I've learned over the past few weeks that the spreadsheet jockeys running IAG are destroying the Aer Lingus brand with each passing day and people are beginning to actively avoid all IAG airlines. By the time it starts affecting the bottom line, causing them to pay attention, it'll already be too late.

Finally, I almost admire the balls on the marketing people [who posted this on the 29th](https://twitter.com/AerLingus/status/1057045886340075520). ""Aer Lingus, we love Chicago-bound Irish rugby players. Irish runners, on the other hand, can go fuck themselves"". Presumably the same geniuses responsible [for this](https://simpleflying.com/aer-lingus-films-x-factor-contestants-in-misleading-business-cabin-then-moves-them-back-to-economy/). #AerSleazeus"
"""2018-10-15T06:42:00.000Z""",Flight EI123 and the death of the Aer Lingus brand,"Buckle up, this is going to be the rantiest rant I've written in years. It's mostly about getting it off my chest as, based on our experiences over October 5th and 6th, it will have zero effect on the dire state of Aer Lingus.

Let's do the timeline first and then dive into the death of once-well-regarded brand.

### An early start but lots of excitement

My wife, 5 kids and I woke at 4.30am in Bandon on Friday October 5th to go to Chicago for our mini ""summer"" holiday and for the Chicago Marathon. This was the first time any of the kids had ever been to America and their excitement had been growing for months. We were only going for 5 days so we aimed to cram a lot in.

We arrived at the Red Car Park in Dublin airport around 9.00am after a toughish drive in the dark and rain.

### Pre-clearance - what's the point?

Initially everything went relatively well despite the insane queues for pre-clearance which had us stressed that we'd miss the flight. I've done an equal split of flights to the US via Dublin and Heathrow over the past few years. Only once has pre-clearance been quick. I've never queued for more than 45 minutes in the US via LHR. And they've heard of air-conditioning in US airports. I just don't get the value proposition of Dublin any more. And after last weekend, all of my US flights will be ORK-LHR-\* from now on if possible.

In any case, we ran from the DHS agents to the gate and were relieved to see the gate was still open. People continued to dribble in for at least another 20 minutes. The plane was filled with people taking part in the marathon on Sunday. Some estimates put it at up to 100 runners out of 300ish total.

### Your flight is delayed due to faulty equipment

The planned departure time at 11.30am passed without comment but the main door was still open. After more delay, the pilot informed us that the navigation system was malfunctioning and was being replaced. No big deal, we all thought. Cue jokes about giving them our phones and using them for navigation. Eventually after approx 2hrs, the pilot announced that the replacement part and full plane reboot hadn't worked. The plane was going nowhere and the flight crew were outside of their working window.

Everyone was deeply disappointed but accepted that shit happens and things break down.

Now we just needed a plan B from Aer Lingus. A big worry was that we'd arrive too late for the race number collection on Saturday and therefore not be allowed to run on Sunday.

### 5hrs on a plane on the ground

It was at this point that the clusterfuck began.

Aer Lingus proceeded to provide _zero_ information to passengers for hours. Even the pilot was getting extremely frustrated. We still have no idea what the hell was going on during this phase of the hellfest. What we were sure of was that there wasn't another A330 just idling around the back of Hangar 6.

We sat there until after 4pm. Yup, close to 5hrs sitting on a plane being offered sips of water.

That pointless delay meant that no one could arrange alternative flights via LHR/AMS/CDG.

The main meal was offered without the hot bit. The timing of this was obviously to make sure they weren't on the hook for food vouchers, as almost immediately afterwards, without warning, we're all told to disembark. Still without any actual information being provided by ground staff.

### Communications, what's that?

Everyone assumed we'd now get told what the plan was. Hah, LOL. More delays, more waiting. At least now there were promises of updates. Which didn't occur. Of course no food vouchers were offered because didn't they feed us a slice of brown bread, mini pasta salad and chocolate mousse already?

{{< tweet 1048258048052154368 >}}

Finally around 6.30pm they officially cancelled the flight and told us a replacement flight was being arranged for Saturday. A moment of happiness which was immediately killed when they said that flight would be at 3pm. There was a roar of frustration from the now utterly exhausted passengers. No sorry, actually, we meant 4pm. Jesus they can't even get the flight time right.

100+ marathoners started wondering if there was any point in even flying.

But our day wasn't over yet. Oh no.

The organisational geniuses then told us we'd have to queue for new boarding passes for tomorrow. We queued for 2.5 hours to get that boarding pass. They had 2 people and one ticket printer and they printed off each ticket one by one as each passenger presented themselves. We wanted to scream in frustration. Just as we got to the top of the line, one of them says to the other ""maybe we should open another gate?"". After 2.5hrs, this brainwave struck her?

### Rent-a-heavy

It was during this phase of the wait that the nastiest aspect of the experience occurred. Three Airport ""Police"" in their faux-SWAT gear arrived. No passenger had been obnoxious. No one was acting in a threatening manner. If anything, I thought we were all ridiculously polite in the face of relentless incompetence. One of those three then stood at the side of the queue looking extremely intimidating, staring people out. The other two were wall flowers at the back.

If your solution to the complete incompetence and ineptitude of your systems, processes and people is to call rent-a-heavy, you're doing everything wrong.

### The Citywest Hotel, Dublin Airport

[Sports Travel International](https://sportstravelinternational.com/) could teach all of Aer Lingus how to do customer service and communications. We have used them to do the London and New York Marathons. We're also using them for Boston next year. We didn't use them for Chicago due to all of the kids and it being a combined race/holiday trip. But the superb Martin Joyce didn't differentiate between those who were travelling with him and those who weren't. He found out exactly what we'd need to do in order to collect our race numbers at 5.30am on Sunday morning and then got on the tannoy to tell us all. I can only imagine how garbled that message would have been from Aer Lingus. If you want to do an international marathon I can't recommend Martin and his team enough. Absolute professionals who deserve all of your business. I can only hope he doesn't use Aer Lingus for Boston next year. I'd happily take Norwegian out of Cork to Providence. But of course IAG intends to acquire Norwegian and ruin them too.

After we got the boarding passes and collected our luggage, we headed downstairs to be told which of the airport hotels we'd be shuttled to for the night. It was now nearly 9pm. I was completely shattered. What did we find? Another goddammed queue with another two staff members trying to handle everything.

They told us a bare-faced lie that the airport hotels were now full. Unfortunately for them, one of the passengers had just rung the hotels direct. They had plenty of rooms. Aer Lingus were clearly just not willing to pay the room rate.

Where did they send us? Citywest! Over 30 minutes away on a bus. Other people on the bus were checking out flights via Heathrow and seemed willing to spend over €2000 for a one-way flight in order to extract themselves from the clutches of Aer Lingus.

Oh holy cow, I just heard that one of our neighbours was put up in a hotel in **Gorey** recently by Aer Lingus after a cancelled flight. That's 111km away!

More than twelve hours after we arrived in the airport, we finally got to leave.

The Citywest Hotel could teach Aer Lingus a few things about dealing with groups of people. They had all of the key-cards ready when we arrived. In two ticks they got us adjoining rooms. They had signs with information about the return bus back to the airport and they had food (albeit pretty awful) ready and waiting. We wolfed down some of the food and hit the sack. I was honestly ready to give up and go home at this stage.

The Comfort Suites on North Michigan Avenue could teach Aer Lingus a few things about customer service too. My wife rang to tell them we wouldn't make it that day but to please hold on to our booking. Not only did they hold on to the booking, they decided (unprompted) not to charge us for that first night despite there being zero chance of them renting it out with such short notice.

Just to make the day perfect, some dumb darts-playing fuck set off the fire alarm twice in the hotel at 2.30am. Twice in one day that I had murder on my mind.

After a big breakfast, we booked a large taxi and got ourselves to the airport as early as possible. Under no circumstances were we going to take the shuttle bus back and get into another damned queue with all of the other Citywest passengers.

We asked each other as we headed around the M50 ""I wonder how they can screw things up today?"". Oh in many many ways.

### My favourite error - UserExceptionError

Up to the self-service baggage tagging machine we went and scanned the first boarding pass ""UserExceptionError"". Second one - ""UserExceptionError"". And so on.

Are you fucking kidding me? Did we really wait 2.5hrs in a queue the previous night for a set of boarding passes that didn't work??????

Oh yes we did.

Over to one of the ground staff. She prints out 7 more boarding passes.

Back to the machine.

- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""

![Fist of death](/images/2018/10/dilbert_fist_of_death.jpg)
&nbsp;

We were brought up to the counter so that the staff could check in the bags for us and issue the third set of boarding passes.

### We process 10,000 carcasses a day

And here we finally get to one of the key reasons why we are being treated like cattle heading to an abattoir rather than human beings. An older, presumably senior staff member was there. I quietly passed comment that ""you know 300 other people are going to have to go through this?"". To which he boasted ""we process 10000 people a day, we can handle 300"". Holy shit, clue-meter reads zero. He had managed to completely miss the point. He didn't give a damn that 300 frustrated tired stressed people would be going through the same ridiculous rigmarole, he thought that the whole process was all about Aer Lingus's needs. How can anyone in a customer facing role think and communicate like this in 2018? But I don't blame him. More on that later.

Beside us was a family with a tiny baby. They were simply asking for either a bassinet or the assurance of an empty seat beside them. Stony faced refusal to guarantee anything. The grandmother was made of stern stuff tho and rightly hounded them. ""You expect us to hold a baby for 8 hours on a plane?"". The robots were unmoved.

Another person was crying.

Another person missed a special party being thrown in her honour.

Another family also had a tiny baby.

People who'd paid for Business Class customer service stood mouth agape.

Stoney faces in response. Computer says no.

{{< youtube D4A18tUUb2Y >}}
&nbsp;

We had to go through the pre-clearance hellscape again. Luckily it flowed a bit quicker. We had lots of time to spare and hung around the gate in case there were any more surprises.

Which of course there were.

### We apologise for any inconvenience caused

The scheduling geniuses in Aer Lingus put our flight on an hour before an existing scheduled flight to Chicago. We should have known things were about to go wrong again when three more Airport Police heavies arrived. The youngfella on the desk barked into the tannoy ""Welcome to Aer Lingus flight EI1123. Due to an issue with catering, this flight is delayed. We apologise for any inconvenience. Click"". A massive roar erupted from all the passengers. They may as well have used a Dalek to deliver that message. The heavies were on standby. Several more delay announcements ensued.

You have fucked with 300 people non-stop for more than 24hrs and you make zero attempt to get things right on day 2 or show even the tiniest bit of humanity? It was quite clear that all of their focus, including the catering, was on the scheduled flight. Which of course managed to leave before us.

Finally we began boarding. Dalek-boy continued barking out updates over the tannoy. He then did a full-on Meet The Parents scene, continuing to board by row number, despite the departure gate being completely empty. I see that Gaylord Focker was going to Chicago too.

{{< youtube v6FK2RmVgGE >}}
&nbsp;

### Oh you wanted a seat with your ticket?

We finally got on the white charter [A340-300 | 9H-FOX from HiFly](http://www.hifly.aero/en/a340/9h-fox.html). Whilst I hadn't relaxed yet (did I mention my entire neck and shoulder was seized with stress since the previous night?), I thought we were finally done with the stupidity.

Silly Conor, there weren't done messing with us yet. Wait for it - Aer Lingus had assigned my wife and four of my kids seats that did not exist on this plane. The flight attendants said they didn't think there were any spare seats. My wife was really starting to panic but kept it from the kids.

How in the name of fuck can you not know the layout of the plane you have just chartered? How can every one of you be so utterly useless at every single step of this process? Your planes break down every day (more on that later) so how can all of this seem to be such an apparently unique situation to you?

After everyone boarded, seats were found for my family, as plenty of people had either given up on the trip in disgust/frustration or had arranged alternative flights. I think/hope the people with babies were also sorted out by the Portuguese charter staff.

I didn't sleep. The rage kept me awake. Also the slop they now serve as an in-flight meal on transatlantic flights. The kids were utterly dejected at this stage. So much for their amazing holiday to the USA. The name Aer Lingus was now dirt to them. You might as well have renamed it Trump Airlines, they were so disgusted with how everything had gone.

### Arrival

We landed. Down to baggage reclaim. As one last fuck-you, the baggage from the two Aer Lingus flights and a Frontier flight were all on the same tiny carousel. Hundreds of people milled around. Can you explain the benefits of Dublin pre-clearance to me again? After another long wait, we got two cabs to the hotel.

It was now late local time. We trotted out to the closest convenience store, a 7-11, bought some shitty sandwiches, gobbled them down, and went to bed. The rage was still pulsating and I was seriously considering not running the following day due to exhaustion and stress.

After a few restless hours sleep, we got up at 4.30am and jogged in the rain down to the late-number-pickup office in the Hilton. Most people there were from our flight. The staff/volunteers could not have been nicer.

### The Chicago Marathon

A decent bite in Pret (first tasty food in 48 hours) and we went back to the Comfort Suites to relax (aka stress out) for a bit. We then walked down to our starting corral and finally began cheering-up and feeling the amazing buzz from everyone around us.

Dropping and smashing my phone did not help however.

And then we were off.

I went out far too fast, mostly fueled by the burning rage of 1000 suns towards Aer Lingus. But unfortunately rage can't make up for a complete lack of sleep, exhaustion and being completely stressed out. Instead of getting my hoped-for personal best, I just got around in the usual time. However the rage helped keep me going during the eight middle miles of nausea which were probably stress related too.

We finished, gulped down the free can of beer, walked back to the Comfort Suites, showered and headed out with the children to start our summer holiday which was now 20% shorter.

A brilliant few days ensued and I highly recommend visiting Chicago. Via a different airline obviously.

The return trip was uneventful. Thank fuck.

A big congratulations to everyone on that flight who finished the marathon. 20 Irish people did sub 3hrs. If any of those were on EI123, you are legends. Mark Smith of Eagle AC in Cork finished in a time of 2h 34m 21s.

### Honourable Mentions

I would like to mention those Aer Lingus staff who showed some empathy towards the 300 passengers - specifically the captain of the original flight and the flight attendant who is also a runner and knew what a huge blow all of this was to her fellow athletes.

I did not hear the word ""sorry"" outside of that, apart from the classic legal-speak ""we're sorry to hear that"".

### What does Aer Lingus stand for in 2018?

Now let's talk about the bigger picture and how _""Shite But Not Cheap""_ is not a long-term sustainable business model for Aer Lingus.

I mentioned several times that I didn't necessarily blame the individual staff for the EI123 fiasco. I still don't know how much was incompetence and how much was the obnoxious Standard Operating Procedures. In either case it's a management failure. The rot starts at the top. Either the staff aren't trained correctly, are chronically understaffed, their support systems are missing, or the SOPs are now so anti-customer as to be offensive.

The outgoing CEO of Aer Lingus talked recently about the success of their value model. Do they really think they are the value option in comparison to actual low-cost airlines? Check any route and compare Aer Lingus to the real value options. They are often 2x or 3x the price. So what exactly are we paying for apart from the semi-state legacy? Horrendous customer service, unreliable planes, food slop that costs them a max of €2 per head and some movies on a small old LCD?

I loved their ridiculously misguided tweet when Norwegian launched from Cork and Shannon:

{{< tweet 834802022096498689 >}}

Now let's rewrite that the other way, to be accurate:

- Overpriced ticket with bag included?
- Seat row number that doesn't actually exist on your plane?
- Included slop you wouldn't feed your cat?
- Pre-clearance that takes 1.5 hours to get through?

Cheers Aer Lingus, you're grand. I'll take a genuinely cheap flight, my own sandwich, podcasts and Netflix offline any day.

Side-note biz idea: Deliveroo/UberEats to the Gate. Impossible with modern airport security but damn that would be awesome.

As I said above ""Shite But Not Cheap"" is not sustainable. The one thing Aer Lingus used to stand for was high quality transatlantic service. You knew they had your back. If things went wrong, they'd be all over it to make sure you got to where you needed to go. You were confident and relaxed in your travel. Everyone was good-natured and friendly. You relied on them.

Most of all you felt like you were dealing with humans in the past. Now it feels like a bunch of robots who have had stock phrases and responses drilled into them and where ""operational efficiency"" is the only metric by which they are measured.

Why would anyone choose Aer Lingus over a genuine discount carrier now? A misguided sense of patriotism?

The dead heart of the Aer Lingus brand was really driven home to me by the contrast of the all-white charter plane and the nearby Rugby-player-liveried plane. On the one hand you had the faceless brandless plane of HiFly which was going to take 100 brutalised exhausted athletes to their marathon. On the other you had some marketing bullshit about how much Aer Lingus supports our rugby players.

An honest Aer Lingus livery would be all-white. ""Aer Lingus, we stand for nothing, except profit margin.""

I was reminded of brand values again on our drive back to Cork when we stopped at the Motorway Services near Rathdowney. Like all the other Topaz garages, it has recently been rebranded with the hilariously awful Circle-K design from North America. Like something you'd expect to see in Deliverance. So this huge amount of money has been spent on making all the garages looking ""right"". But when I went to the restrooms, the seat was falling off the toilet.

These conglomerates all share the same mindset. As long as it looks pretty on the surface, who cares if it's a shitshow underneath. Or to use the most accurate description - lipstick on a pig.

### Customer Service (again)

Any company that uses the phrase ""we apologise for any inconvenience caused"" when things go wrong, is telling you in no uncertain terms ""give us your money, shut the fuck up, we don't care"". It's the language of the legal department.

A real highlight of the trip was this accidental comedy routine from the Aer Lingus social media team.

![Aer Sleazeus](/images/2018/10/aer_sleazeus.jpg)

{{< tweet 1049283189213224960 >}}

Modern tech companies understand that the most important thing to do during an ""outage"" is to communicate. What's happening as it happens. ETAs for fixes. Explanations. Realtime updates. And then published post-mortems and commitments around how they are going to avoid the problem in the future and what they have already changed.

Not vague lies about passing it on for internal review.

Aer Lingus is stuck in some 1960s timewarp where passengers are to be treated like idiot mushrooms and the internet was never invented. They seem to be basing their biz model on the worst of US airline behaviour. Why would you use 50 year old business models unless you are completely out of ideas?

And just to show that nothing works in there, what did they do this week? They sent us a customer satisfaction survey about the _cancelled_ flight.

### Ireland's National Airline - Ryanair

Ryanair is the national airline. Aer Lingus is a Stage Oirish regional branch of a Anglo-Spanish multinational. You can only fool some of the people some of the time. I feel particularly sorry for old Americans who still think it's the classic Aer Lingus and are expecting Darby O'Gill and The Little People. Instead they get this:

![Leprechaun](/images/2018/10/leprechaun-warwick-davis.jpg)
&nbsp;

Internet word of mouth is fast and brutal. This is going to catch up on Aer Lingus sooner rather than later.

Remember all those idiots who fought to make sure Ryanair, the most successful airline in Europe, wouldn't get their hands on Aer Lingus, in case they'd ruin it? Same idiots who told us not to be talking down the economy in 2008. Same idiots who spent €160m on a white elephant terminal in Cork instead of increasing the number of flights/destinations. Official Ireland. All surface, no depth. Enjoy your slop on your next Paddy's Day flight.

When you fly with a genuinely low-cost airline like Ryanair, the understanding is clear. I pay you almost no money, you provide me with a flying-bus and zero customer service. And if shit happens, well, I paid you almost no money.

In contrast, we paid Aer Lingus over €3700 for our flights. That's a different understanding and a different expectation. If I'd paid Business Class on Oct 5th, I'd currently be looking into legal options beyond statutory compensation. Particularly if I was that elderly couple in Business Class who were forced to haul their heavy bags out to a bus and stay in Citywest. The Merrion it ain't.

### Incident Management

If Aer Lingus wants to join the 21st century, they need to publish how their incident management system works. Based on Oct 5th, I strongly suspect they don't have one. Hence all the headless chickens and complete lack of comms or joined-up processes. Naive me thought their multi-million euro Enterprise Service Bus from IBM would enable a whole new generation of systems and processes in the airline. Not UserExceptionError.

As soon as they knew the navigation system was faulty, incident/exception management should have kicked in with a single person in charge of the entire situation (no not ""Johnny"" in a hi-vis) with formal handovers as shifts ended. That person would be the single point of contact and coordination. A passenger liaison on the ground would work with them to ensure all passengers knew immediately what what happening and what the plans were. Not some clueless youngfella promising over the tannoy that we'd have a ""substantial"" update in 40 minutes after 7 hours of waiting. An update which of course came after more than an hour.

""Everyone"" has a smartphone in 2018. Everyone has a phone. Most people have the internet. We should have been getting timely updates (once every 30 minutes) on exactly what each delay was about and what they were doing. And if the update was ""we're busting our balls here trying to get a charter plane to Dublin tomorrow so you can get to your marathon, it's proving very difficult on a Friday afternoon. No we haven't all pissed off to Nora's going-away do in the Radisson Blu"", everyone would have been grateful and relaxed just a little bit because of the clarity and honesty.

Information is power. When people feel powerless, they get frustrated and angry. This is a fundamental problem in most airlines and airports still. And most of it is easily solvable with current technology. You just have to commit to communicating rather than calling rent-a-heavy.

Actually, I'll send you what we're working on for an event in early November when it's ready. It'd be perfect for airlines/airports. And all Open Source so it won't cost you cheapskates a penny. No internet access needed.

Realtime comms is what your airline app could facilitate. Again it's 2018. But IT was one area where they recently boasted they had saved money. Oh bless, no one in Aer Lingus got the memo - [All companies are technology companies now](https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/all-companies-are-technology-companies-now/). Maybe don't lowball the people writing your apps. And yes I used to work for FeedHenry. So I know.

The fact that your Aer Lingus online account has no connection to the online check-in process shows just how prehistoric their systems are. The former can't even pass the reference number to the latter when you go to check-in. Top programming tip, use: ?ref_num=XYZ123

I completely understand that running the operations side of an airline is very very hard. It amazes me how well it works most of the time. And it requires everyone to be efficient. But that's table stakes, all airlines have to be able to do it. It's how you act when things go wrong that define the quality of your organisation/systems/processes. And that's where Aer Lingus is clearly completely broken.

### Cost Savings

In their most recent annual results announcement, Aer Lingus stated that ""it saw significant cost savings through efficient growth with higher productivity and from cost initiatives. This included areas such as maintenance, selling and IT. ""

EI123 on October 5th was the outcome of those cost savings. From the broken down plane to the non-existent customer service to the UserExceptionError. I spotted on Twitter that other passengers had cancellations/delays to/from Chicago on the 4th and the 9th. If that was St Munchin in every case, then it's not fit for flying.

{{< tweet 1050091952547475457 >}}

Anecdotally from people I talk to, Aer Lingus planes seem to be breaking down a _lot_. Maybe don't try to save money on maintenance. Because we all know what the final outcome of that will be. My 50th birthday was almost ruined when, on my previous flight from the US, the Aer Lingus LHR-ORK leg was cancelled due to breakdown, followed by another customer service fiasco in DUB.

Are breakdown statistics published anywhere? Most of the data I've seen is US-based and mostly about delays. There are some interesting stats on [European cancellations here](https://www.flightstats.com/v2/global-cancellations-and-delays). IAG-owned airlines, including Aer Lingus, are very prominent.

### Final Words

As I said earlier, the rot in any organisation starts at the top. I see the outgoing CEO stated ""By any objective measure Aer Lingus has been successful in recent years and continues to have significant opportunity to build upon the strong fundamentals of our value model"". Any objective measure except customer service, IT and maintenance.

If you treat customer service as a cost to be minimised, you are on the way to being disrupted. Those who can't compete on price have to use customer service as a differentiator. What else is there for Aer Lingus to use now? Watching BA plummet to near the bottom of customer satisfaction surveys is a preview of what's going to happen to Aer Lingus soon without a fundamental change in attitude (management).

IAG's numbers have been great over the past couple of years. I don't know how much of that revenue growth has been due to the increase in numbers of people flying globally in general or due to M&A. How much non-M&A market share growth have they had? Same question about market share for Aer Lingus. Everything was going gangbusters in 2007 too. When it all goes bang again (hello Italy), which airlines will survive?

I honestly can't wait for the next generation of airlines to come along and wipe out these 20th century dinosaurs. They'll be forgotten in an instant. Does anyone under 40 remember TWA? Exactly.

I've just found out that my next US flight is in a week. I'll obviously be taking the safer option of ORK-LHR-RDU. Sadly that first leg will have to be with the dreaded green leprechaun.

I'll leave the final word to my 11yo daughter who created this on her phone on day 2 as we entered the even longer pre-clearance queue:

"""2018-04-08T09:49:50+01:00""",From Liverpool to Manchester - Conor does his 50 (miles) before 50 (years),"Last March I decided I wanted to run a 50 mile race before I hit the big five oh in May of this year. On Monday, in spite of freezing rain, hail, sleet and snow, I somehow managed it and I can't stop randomly grinning.

As always, have no fear, this won't be a mile-by-mile race report. I'd fall asleep writing it :-) Speaking of which, one of my ultra-running top tips is ""Don't listen to the audiobook of 'Why We Sleep' on miles 30-40 of a 50 miler if you want to avoid getting verrrrry verrrry sleepy."" (The same also applies to the audio book of Niall Ferguson's 'The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook').

I know 50 miles is way outside of the experience of most people. But trust me when I say that most of you reading this could have done it. A solid level of fitness, a bit of stubborness and experience of lots of time on your feet is really all you need. Remember I'm 60lbs overweight and I finished. I'll mention the weight thing again shortly.

## Training. Or as I like to call it, not training.
Training for L2M50 was a disaster. I ignored every bit of advice in books and immediately went from 22ish miles per week to 37 miles per week in January. Very quickly both achilles were in pain and both knees were complaining. Despite trying everything, the right achilles was still hurting all the way up to race day. I'd end up dong a long run on a Sunday and then taking days off for the achilles to calm down. My tapering consisted of not running at all for the last two weeks, hoping to give it a rest. Stoopid.

My wife had a better time with training and was far more diligent. She spotted MCI back-to-back marathons in Limerick in March which would have been an ideal check of how we'd handle 50 miles. In the end it was cancelled with the snow. Instead we did the EOI Lusk Marathon followed by the MCI Salthill one. All the signs were good (apart from that Salomon Sense Pro Max disaster in Salthill).

## How to avoid being head wrecked for 50 miles
Look, my marathon times are a disaster. I'm slowly getting faster but I'm still crazy slow. However that turns out to be a big help when getting your head sorted for a 50 miler. I'm used to spending many (many many) hours on my feet moving slowly and never DNFing marathons.

It's possibly a placebo, but I get great value from [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/). There have been many marathons where I've channelled Andy's calm dulcet tones and got myself out of serious negativity.

The other huge help on Monday was actually The Barkley Marathons on the previous weekend. Seeing and reading about the hell everyone went through this year gave me a sense of perspective ""It's only a flat 50 miles Conor. And your collar-bone isn't broken like Eoin Keith's was.""

## Liverpule
How the hell have I got to 49 years old and never visited Liverpool before? The regenerated docks area is fabulous and everyone was just lovely. The hotel and start line were at Albert Dock and we registered just beside them on Sunday night in the cold.

Whilst queuing for kit-check and photo, I overheard the best advice a nervous ultra virgin could hear - ""don't think of it as a 50 mile race. Think of it as an 8 mile race followed by lots of food. Then a 6 mile race followed by lots of food. And so on"". It really worked. That's exactly how I broke the day down and it kept me sane throughout.

## Torrential Scouse rain
This caused me more stress in the week coming up to the race than anything else. Initially heavy snow was predicted. Then lots and lots of rain. Andddd low-temps going sub-zero with wind chill. It got to the point where I packed trekking poles and my trail runners, I was that worried. But the worry ended up working to my benefit as I'd packed every possible thing.

We looked out the hotel room window at 4.45am to see very heavy rain. I decided to wear thick gloves, full length running tights and a buff, in addition to a base layer, running top and waterproof jacket. We walked out the door and were hit with bitterly cold wind to go with the stinging rain.

## When you were young and your heart was an open book
Little did we know what lay ahead.
![Start Line](/images/2018/04/start_line.jpg)

## Penny Lane is in my knees and in my hips
237 poor souls headed off in the rain, wind and dark along the Mersey at 6am. I was sure we were running faster than my marathon pace which really bothered me. It turned out we weren't even close to that, it was the conditions, along with two dead legs in my case, that made it feel so hard.

The first 8 miles were in the streets of Liverpool. I spotted Penny Lane at one stage (not really a lane if you ever visit). The rain turned to hail, then sleet and then snow. Stress levels rose. The first checkpoint was where is switched to more country paths etc. From then on it was a mix of paths, suburbia such as Warrington and gritted trails.

## I cannae feel ma leg
That's ma leg ya bumpot (for [fans of Billy Connolly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZj0AkZUpDo)).

Whilst we were both really feeling the cold, my wife was suffering a lot worse. She didn't bring gloves and she was wearing a running skirt. Our pace was mis-matched which caused her to stop and wait for me and then cool down excessively. She wouldn't take up my offer of my soaking wet heavy gloves and we didn't have the brilliant inspiration of Charlie Sharpe's crisp packets. Eventually it all got too much and she DNFed around mile 20. I was heartbroken for her and then had a few miles of self-pity as I'd pictured us finishing together for months.

I think the two things that saved me were the gloves and the fact that I'm obese. I know it sounds nuts but fat people stay warmer in the cold than thin people. As [this article says](https://www.popsci.com/article/science/fyi-do-fat-people-stay-warmer-thin-people) (semi-jokingly), the best thing to be in the cold is fat and fit. Bingo!

## They're not puddles, they're lakes
I generally enjoy running off-road in [manky](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Manky) conditions but that's always in trail shoes and usually for not more than 13 miles. The relentless rain wasn't just hard on me, it destroyed the paths we were running on.

My semi-slick Hoka Clifton's had landed me flat on my back a few weeks previously on some wet grass so I was ridiculously careful trying to tip-toe around every bit of flooding. But it was exhausting and made it impossible to keep a running pace. Eventually around mile 40 I said fuck it and ploughed straight through the water from then on. My feet were like blocks of ice.

## Conor invents a new treatment for achilles tendinopathy
As I said, I've had right achilles pain since January. Guess what I haven't had since last Monday? Achilles pain! So if you too have tendinopathy, then I highly recommend doing 50 miles in freezing rain with your feet soaked through and your achilles submerged for many miles.

## Spuds and instant coffee never tasted so good
As the miles built up, the food at the checkpoints just got better and better. I stuffed whole baby potatoes, crisps, sausage rolls, pretzels and sweets into my gob. But the highlights were the coffee, tea and hot chocolate at three different stops. I think they may have kept me just warm enough to keep going.

## I'm just going to stand in a field for 14 hours
I don't know how the volunteers did it. I'll forever be in awe of them and in their debt for getting me around. The food, the smiles, the words of encouragement, the assistance to people who were struggling, it was all amazing. Thank you thank you thank you. And to everyone (including the husband of another runner) who took care of my wife and got her to Didsbury, we will never forget your kindness.

## Oooh a nukular power station
As anyone who [follows me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2843314) knows, my training runs are less about running and more about a photo tour of local forests and hills. I took the sum total of 2 photos during the race. One of a nice bridge (no idea where) and another of what I thought was a nuclear power station. I had many classic Simpsons scenes in my head. I was gutted to discover afterwards that it was a boring coal-fired one.

## Looks like I'm gonna do this thing
Getting to 25 miles had me in great mood. I was half way. But getting to 28 had me at a real low point. Oh my god there's 22 miles left. Everything hurt. In fact, so many things hurt that it kinda helped. I couldn't focus on the pain in my ITB, when I also had pains in both feet, my lower back, my wrist (WTF?), my other knee, my calves, my quads and my core.

But when I got to mile 37, I knew, barring a catastrophe, that I was going to finish. I ""only"" had a half marathon left to do. The final CP was at mile 44. I stuffed my face again, refilled the water bottles, added the Tailwind and staggered off into the dusk.

![Conor 01](/images/2018/04/conor_l2m50_01.jpg)

## Where's the bleedin' ferry across the Mersey when I need it?
The markings all day had been great as long as you kept your wits about you. I had to shout to only two people that I saw going astray. But with 4 miles to go, my brain was fudge. I mindlessly followed some people in front of me and after maybe half a mile we realised we had gone wrong. I'd followed them and they'd followed someone else, who had disappeared.

I had the [Viewranger](http://www.viewranger.com/en-US) app on my phone along with the route pre-loaded. A quick check proved that we were on the wrong side of the Mersey. The only way to fix it was to re-trace our steps. Arghghghghghghghghghgh. Would you believe I actually packed a compass? Again I had L2M50 confused with the Barkley Marathons. I found the turn we'd missed and started walking as fast as I could along the river in a complete mudfest of a track.

## Sorry mate, I'm not from around here
The trail on the river seemed endless. I kept checking Viewranger to confirm I hadn't overshot as there were no course markings along there. Finally I saw the footbridge into Didsbury. I marched up to the junction and saw a course marking. But I couldn't figure out whether to go left or right as I missed the blindingly obvious arrow on the same pole. I tried asking two people going into a pub for directions but I nearly broke down in front of them. They had no idea where the club was. This turned out to be a stroke of luck as the finish line was at the rugby club not the football club.

## I would walk 500 miles and I feel like I have
What followed was the longest mile of my life. Longer than my first marathon where both calves seized solid. Longer than Brighton 2017 where the heat got to me and I started singing out loud as I ran. Longer than my first 10k where I thought I was going to die. Yeah that long.

Oh wait, here's the sports club. Nooooooo, it's the golf club. Ah here we are. Nooooooo, it's the cricket club. Finally, the road is coming to an end. I must be here. What? Another bridge? FFS are you effing kidding me (last one shouted out loud).

And then......is that......Catherine?????? OMFG, it is, I'm here. Surely they'll take pity on me now and not force me to do a loop of the pitch.

No chance.

## Cue Chariots of Fire music. Or maybe Peppa Pig
I slowly stagger around the mudbath of a pitch. Smiling from ear to ear. But then I turn the first corner and who do I spy coming on to the pitch? The 3 people from earlier. Jogging. I'm not a physically competitive person (clearly) but sometimes, when I'm approaching that finish line, something in my brain kicks in.

Fukkit, time to drop the hammer Conor. I start running. In my mind I'm Usain Bolt. In reality I'm a fat old dude sliding around in mud at 0.00005 MPH. Can I get to the finish line without landing on my face? Maybe. The cheering starts. I hang on. One last jump to land on the rubber mat. I did it.

![Finish line](/images/2018/04/finish_l2m50.jpg)

## 14:02:00
2 hrs and 2 minutes over the cutoff for a loop of Barkleys :-) I know it's a ridiculous time to do 50 flat miles. I don't care. I had one job to do on Monday - finish. I did that job. I'm a very very happy man.

My Garmin died around mile 46. I'm pretty sure I did something more like 52 miles. And despite all the pains and my inability to run any faster than I walked at the end, I think I could have done another 5-10 miles if I'd really had to.

![Medal](/images/2018/04/medal_l2m50.jpg)

## The post-race low
It's a week later. I did 2.5 miles on the treadmill today and I'm mostly ok. Tight hip, slight ITB glitches but otherwise fine.

We're both in that horrible post-race ""depression"" where you've thought about little else for months and now there's nothing. It's worse for Catherine as she missed out on finishing.

Whilst of course we'll do the 25K [Great Railway Run](http://www.thegreatrailwayrun.com/grrHome.php) and [The Surf Turf and Tar](https://surfturfntar.com/) Half, plus a couple of marathons in the next month or two, we need something longer. If you know of any 50k to 50 mile non-technical non-bog non-crazy-vert Ultras coming up soonish in Ireland/UK/Europe, let me know. I'll be trawling the usual sites.

## What's next?
Usual plan. Lose a ton of weight. Get a lot faster. Over every distance.

Based on Monday, I think I have a 100k in me right now but of course I don't have anything like 100 miles in me yet. I want to look at doing a European mountain ultra.

## Final words
If you're thinking about doing an Ultra, have a look at all the events that the [GB Ultras](http://www.gbultras.com/) team organises. They really do an amazing job and [their communities](https://www.facebook.com/groups/357383037943147/) on the dreaded Facebook are extremely friendly and welcoming to ultra virgins. Go on, give it a go.

Oh course, a week later and I'm already planning my next big run :-)

## Update 1 - April 10th 2018 - Gear
I'm sure everyone is dying to know what gear the 6th slowest runner in #L2M50 used :-) Well I'm going to tell you anyway. Starting from my toes: X-Socks trail socks, Hoka One One Clifton 3 running shoes, Ron Hill running tights, Runderwear briefs, Lidl long-sleeve compression top, Berlin Marathon finisher top, Ron Hill Infinity Torrent jacket, Buff, Rab Latok cap with flaps, Salomon Adv 5 Skin hydration vest and softflasks, Helly Hansen spare base layer (unused, stupidly), Tailwind nutrition, Rowntrees sour pastilles, 4 megatons of GU & Torq gels (unused), 2XU heavy cycling gloves (useless), Jaybird X3 Bluetooth headphones, Samsung Galaxy S8+ (waterproof), Eotw generic phone armband (pretty useless), Garmin Fenix 3 watch (disappointed it didn't last).

## Update 2 - April 11th 2018 - Why
I read two things about Ultra running recently that really annoyed me. I should have avoided them and I'm not going to link to them. The first was the comments section in Adharanand Finn's article on the rise of ultrarunning. The second was a Let's Run thread on the same topic. In both, the level of spite and vituperation towards people who do ultra distances was gob-smacking. You'd swear we were murderers based on the bizarre anger expressed.

I read an interview with Spine Race winner Carol Morgan (which I can't currently find) where she just described it as her hobby. And that's it. No different to gardening, knitting, watching other people kick a ball, cycling or home-brewing.

Is running long distances purely a middle-class thing? Not based on the very wide selection of people I've met. Is it for nut-jobs only? I've yet to meet anyone I'd describe as weird at running events, compared say to the behaviour of some ball-sports fanatics at any match. Should we all be using the time we spend running helping lepers in Africa instead? Yes maybe you should Mr Commenter.

It's just a hobby. I'm sure there are assholes who act like doing 50 miles makes them a master of the universe. Again I've never met anyone like that at any running event. In fact, the winner of #L2M50, who did it in less than half the time I did, comes across as an incredibly kind, funny and low-key person. Who happens to be good at running and clearly works hard at it.

So there is no specific ""why"" to doing 50 miles or more really. 26.2 is a completely arbitrary distance. As it 10K or 100K.

I've re-discovered the outdoors via running. It helps with clearing the head. It hopefully keeps me out of an early grave, if I can sort out this weight. It lets me visit cool places and leave no trace. Recently it's the main way I manage to carve out time to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. It disconnects me from the constant noise of the internet. And it's interesting to see what longer and longer distances do to the mind and body.

Oh yeah, a lot of the time, it's good fun. Like any hobby."
"""2018-09-10T07:50:59.148Z""","From NYC to Kerry, a wrap-up of my races over the past year","![Shoes](/images/2018/09/20180821_121150.jpg)

Apart from a couple like the Liverpool to Manchester 50 miler, I haven't been keeping up on my mini race reports over the past year. Hopefully you'll find them useful if you're planning for next year. I'll keep them short and sweet.

## New York City Marathon

I'm not sure whey I never did a full race report on this because it was an incredible experience. It overtook London as the marathon that emotionally impacted me the most. I could not stop saying to myself ""I'm in the NYC marathon. Me"". The support on the streets was mind-blowing. The fact that I had a ridiculously slow day, even for me, doesn't bother me at all. Oh and suddenly realising the crazy Paddy shouting ""Up Ireland"" was actually old workmate Cian, was a total highlight of the day and gave me a huge boost in the final 2 miles. And Shalane won, which made the whole thing perfect. [Fuck yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo63CWP0YgE).

## Clonakilty Half Marathon

We do it every year. It's never easy. This year had the added twist of the jetlag of a 14 hour flight from Austin and a hangover. So of course I PBed :-)

## EOI Lusk Marathon

This was one of the practice runs for L2M50. A small-scale local looped marathon. Really enjoyable. If you like a low key race with very friendly people, this is ideal. They have a whole series of them around the East Coast.

## MCI Salthill Marathon

Another training run for L2M50. Lashed rain all day. Had that problem with the Salomons. But actually really enjoyed it. Salthill and Galway lovely as always. The curry afterwards was even better.

## Liverpool to Manchester 50 Miler

[Full race report here](https://conoroneill.com/2018/04/08/from-liverpool-to-manchester-conor-does-50-before-50/). Starting to think about 100K races in 2019.

## Great Railway Run

This was our second year to do it. I somehow found myself coming last after just a couple of miles with the damned ambulance revving behind me. Where the hell were all the walkers and C25Kers? Anyway, managed to get past a few people and lose the ambulance. This is a gorgeous route and highly recommended.

## Sportyfeel Helsinki City Marathon

I'd only been in Finland once before for work and saw nothing. Which is a real pity as Helsinki is gorgeous. The marathon was two loops and verrrry relaxed and low key. No big crowds and a constantly changing landscape from downtown to forest tracks. I had a really bad day with stomach issues, overheating and general tiredness but got around as always. I think the race would suit a lot of people. Check it out. We loved the bus tour the following day too.

## Ballyheigue Half On The Head

Second year to do this. Worth it for the views alone. Very hilly but I had a great day and powered up them all. This may become a regular fixture for us as you can easily get there from Cork on the morning of the race.

## Brandon Bay Half

Another part of Kerry I'd never been to, this is a lovely area and that's one amazing long beach. But it was a horrible horrible day for a run. Howling wind in my face for 6.5 miles on mostly well packed sand, but with plenty of wet bits too. Then turn around and get pushed along by the same wind. All the while being able to see the entire course. I doubt I'll be doing this again.

## Run Killarney Half Marathon

Most fun you can have with your clothes on in Killarney. This is a total blast. Basically downhill the whole way from Moll's Gap (but with plenty of undulations). Just go hell for leather until you run out of steam - in my case just before we entered the National Park. I PBed everything from 5K to Half Marathon on the day. Loved it. Just go do it.

## East Cork Harbour 10K

We really didn't like the marathon here last year. The first section was fabulous but the rest was either the main road or faceless country roads. The 10K on the other hand is a little gem. Run from Rostellan towards Whitegate and back again. Another balls to the wall, run until you want to puke course. Loved it and got a huge boost seeing Catherina McKiernan absolutely crushing it and coming 3rd **overall**.

## Kerry Ultra 50K

[Full race report here](https://conoroneill.com/2018/09/02/the-kerry-ultra-50k-go-on-sign-up-for-2019/).

## What's left in 2018?

Chicago!

Plus a few more halves and maybe a couple of IMRA races.

My solo ""runs"" on Slí Gaeltacht Mhúscraí, Lackabaun, Coumshingaun, Carrauntoohil and Lough Curra this summer highlighted how much work I have to do to get any sort of acceptable mountain running pace. So I want to focus a lot on that for 2019."
"""2017-01-26T20:43:32+01:00""",Go to a parkrun this Saturday in West Cork,"I talked about [parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com/) in my monster post last year on the [future of Ireland's health](http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/21/greenways-byways-hedgerows-tourism-and-the-future-of-irelands-health/). It was started in the UK in 2010 and has spread around the world. In [parkrun Ireland](https://www.parkrun.ie/) there are over 50 events every week. You may have heard it mentioned on [Operation Transformation](https://ot.rte.ie/) too.

![Parkrun](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/parkrun.jpg)

The idea is incredibly simple. Every Saturday at 9.30am, you turn up to your local parkrun and do 5km. You can sprint, run, jog, walk or amble. If you sign up on the web-site, you get a printable barcode so your time can be recorded every week. A few hours after taking part, you'll get all the stats by email.

* [Clonakilty](http://www.parkrun.ie/clonakilty/)
* [Castlehaven](http://www.parkrun.ie/castlehaven/)
* [Macroom](http://www.parkrun.ie/castledemense/)
* [Ballincollig](http://www.parkrun.ie/ballincollig/)
* [Bere Island](http://www.parkrun.ie/bereisland/)
* [Glengarriff](http://www.parkrun.ie/glengarriff/)

We finally signed up 3 weeks ago and headed down to the Clonakilty Show Grounds - it's behind The Boiler for all you West Cork parents reading this :-) The run is 4 loops of the grounds and the participants included everyone from out-and-out speedsters to people having a gentle walk or pushing a buggy. There is no pressure to ""perform"" and you can never come last, as they always have an organiser at the back.

The organisers are *you*. Every week it's run by those who volunteer. I've done three runs now and it's starting to approach the time I volunteer and do my bit.

Clon had 40ish people each of the weeks I've been there and it's brilliant to see the Operation Transformation walkers out too. It's an extremely welcoming setup where they do a shout-out to all newbies and all the ""tourists"" from other parkruns.

I'm interested in doing Ballincollig too but the numbers there are wonderfully nuts (approx 400 people!). We'll delicately skip over the nonsensical situation in Tramore Valley Park that caused this.

I also really want to try Bere Island. I love the idea of getting on a ferry out to an island to do a run. But it's a bit of a trip down the Beara peninsula to get there for 9.30am. Maybe when the mornings are a bit brighter.

Someone on Twitter recently suggested doing one in Bandon. I think this is a superb idea but with some logistical issues. parkruns are done in open spaces, not on paths or roads. So the options I think we have are (with the associated challenges):

* Bandon RFC - Everyone would have to be out of there before 10.30 when the crowds really start building for the matches/training. Only a problem in winter.
* GAA - Not sure when training happens here. It's the most central with lots of parking too.
* Town Park - Would interfere with Saturday soccer. Also very little parking.
* Bandon Grammar - Not sure if the hockey pitch is suitable. And again, training clashes.
* Golf Club driving range - It's a bit far out but it's almost exactly 1km around so it would be 5 simple loops and people have been running there for years.

One hope for the future is that Castlebernard is mentioned in some [very cool plans by Cork CoCo](http://corklocalareaplans.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Draft-Bandon-Kinsale-MD-LAP.pdf) (note that's a PDF) for Bandon. I don't know if those plans are just ideas or have actually been agreed with the owners. If there was a riverside path out to there with a run around some new tracks, that would fantastic for parkrun and make Bandon a really attractive place to visit.

Any other suggestions for how we could do it?

So come on, overcome your self-consciousness and self-confidence issues and give it a go. You don't even need a pair of runners or running gear. Come out for a walk and see what you think. Watch this old fart staggering around out-of-breath trying to break my Personal Best time and maybe you might consider a jog at some point in the future. No one is judging you, they are applauding you for giving it a go.

Say hello if I convinced you to try it :-)

I began this post several months ago.

The Waterford one is partially opening this week.

However the more I thought about it, the bigger the ""vision"" got. What I'm going to present here is obvious in many places, controversial in others and possibly pure fantasy. But we simply can't continue to stagger blindly forward, as we have been doing for decades. It's time for a fundamental change in how the infrastructure of this country is arranged.

Teddy Roosevelt, 1903: 

> We are not building this country of ours for a day. It is to last through the ages. We stand on the threshold of a new century. We look into the dim years that rise before us, knowing that if we are true that the generations that succeed us here shall fall heir to a heritage such as has never been known before. I ask that we keep in mind not only our own interests, but the interests of our children. Any generation fit to do its work must work for the future, for the people of the future, as well as for itself.

## Let's start small and talk local first - Bandon and Clonakilty Paths
Running or walking in Bandon for health in an exercise in aggravation. I was really pleased when they decided to name a nice short walk by the river after Graham Norton and the old railway walk after Clare O'Leary. But it doesn't look like a single person in the County Council thought it would be a good idea to connect the two of them together. So if you want to make use of the nearby railway walk, you either drive there (many do!) or you risk life and limb on a one-foot wide hard shoulder with cars racing by at 100+kph and regularly crashing into each other.

Every road out of Bandon stops just as the houses do and leaves you in mortal danger if you want to go any further on foot. Anyone who cycles from Bandon to Innishannon is very brave indeed.

Like many Irish towns, Bandon has a love-hate relationship with its river. It's lovely in the few small places you can see it. But it's a beast that has damaged the town too. That relationship was typified by the Bandon Half Marathon and 10K which was run for a few years without a single view of the river. I'm convinced a marathon along the river would attract big crowds. Imagine a Bandon to Kinsale run, via Innishannon, on a permanent river trail.

But Bandon is just one local symptom. Look at Clonakilty and Inchydoney. A beach rated as the best in Ireland by Trip Advisor users has a path out towards it that stops at exactly one mile. From then on, grit your teeth and hope some moron doesn't plough you down if you want to walk or run the remaining miles.

Most of the rest of the country is exactly the same.

There are some bright lights - look at the ring road in Kilkenny any evening. It's jammed with people walking and running. Why? Because they can travel everywhere safely on foot. Literally if you build it they will come.

The Public Bike Scheme in cities also shows what happens when you provide the facilities and infrastructure. [Public bike scheme numbers show cycling is becoming more popular](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/public-bike-scheme-numbers-show-cycling-is-becoming-more-popular-751422.html?utm_source=iosapp&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=sharebutton)


## Waterford Greenway
Earlier in the year I heard about the [Waterford Greenway](http://www.deisegreenway.com/) and got very excited. The idea of being able to safely run, walk or cycle from Waterford to Dungarvan along the old railway line struck me as inspirational. I'm still shocked it has actually happened. I've been on it three times now, ahead of its completion and it far exceeds every expectation I had. The views are stunning, the terrain changes all the time and everything about it puts a huge smile on my face. Given how many people I've met on the Greenway in its unfinished state, I can't wait to see it when it's finished.

![Waterford Greenway 2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CszYeE4XgAEnIq6.jpg)


The important thing about the Greenway (and the [Great Western one](http://www.greenway.ie/) and the upcoming [Cavan/Leitrim one](http://candlgreenway.ie/)) is that it's a facility for everyone, not just tourists. And that idea became the heart of my thoughts on this wider topic.

## West Cork Greenway
Cork CoCo has a ""policy"" of creating a West Cork Greenway. An [excellent study](http://www.corkcoco.ie/co/pdf/562780142.pdf) (warning direct PDF link) was carried out in 2011, which figured out the how, where and cost. But nothing has happened. I don't want to particularly slag off the new not-Alcatraz in the the middle of a freezing cold harbour, as it seems to be off to a good start in peak tourist season. But no one is travelling to Cork to see that. Imagine spending all of that money instead on a perspex enclosed walk across a refurbished Chetwynd Viaduct followed by a renovated Ballinhassig tunnel. It would rightly become world famous.

## Joining the dots
Now think about an East Cork Greenway. And a New Ross Greenway. And a Rosslare Greenway. And a Dublin to Wexford Greenway. Imagine being able to safely travel on foot or bike from Dublin to Wexford to Waterford to Cork to Barley Cove to Glengarrif to Kenmare to Killarney to Tralee and Dingle.

Dammit, build a walking trail around the entire coast of Ireland. Something to make the whole world wake up and pay attention.

It looks like Northern Ireland has the right idea. [NI greenways: 600-mile network could get Stormont green light](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-37355509)

## The Wild Atlantic Way
I have been extremely impressed with the [Wild Atlantic Way](http://www.wildatlanticway.com/home) marketing campaign. Hell, they make me want to move to Ireland and I live here. But that's all it is, a marketing campaign. The only obvious capital spend outside of marketing is for signage.

The core problem is that they show all these amazing places you can visit in Ireland and every single one of them requires you to drive there (or risk your neck cycling), since walking or running there would be suicidal.

We live on a stunning beautiful island. The Wild Atlantic Way should be The Wild Irish way for all of us, not just tourists.

{{< youtube R8DeYWxmtnc >}}

## National Parks
This is a long section and after Greenways was supposed to be the bulk of this post. But it just made me have even bigger ideas. So bear with me, we'll get there.

2016 is the Centennial of the [US National Parks Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/centennial/index.htm) and they are doing a wonderful job promoting that fact. My only experiences of them was a day in Yosemite in 1996 and a day in Grand Canyon in 1998 and both are ingrained on my mind forever.

Let's start by comparing the mission statement of the [Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service](http://www.npws.ie/national-parks) and the US National Parks Service.

> It is the policy of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, endorsed by successive governments, to abide by the criteria and standards for National Parks as set by the IUCN.

vs

> The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world.

Jesus. Are you as depressed as I was when I read the Irish one?


I had to Google to find out if we even had a National Parks service. I have been in one and to be fair, it's bloody brilliant - Killarney National Park. Check my earlier post on my Marathon there. But I've also done the Half Marathon down from Moll's Gap. The park is just fantastic. And in keeping with my theme, was full of both tourists and locals when I was there.

There have been some very positive things happening around the National Parks. The government [bought 5000 acres](http://www.ahrrga.gov.ie/expansion-of-the-wicklow-mountains-national-park/) in Wicklow that NAMA was trying to hawk to some vulture funds.


But why do we only have six parks? Why not one in every county? Why aren't we buying up land that is of minimal agricultural use and using it in the style of the Americans? Roughly [640 million acres](http://www.irunfar.com/2016/08/a-trail-runners-primer-on-public-lands.html), or almost a third of the US, fall under the auspices of the federal government.

Obama gets it, why don't we?
{{< youtube djDx6LKRFdQ >}}

&nbsp;

[Google also gets it](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-us-national-parks), why don't we?

Let's stop playing with [mickey-mouse Rural Recreation funding](http://www.ahrrga.gov.ie/e4-455-million-approved-by-minister-ring-for-75-rural-recreation-projects/), welcome tho it is, and do this right. 


## Pedestrian hostile in two generations
Hillwalkers and outdoorsey people are a very specific segment. We need to be casting the net much wider and make walking the default for everyone, not the exception.

How did we go in two generations from being a piss poor country that couldn't afford cars to one which is actively pedestrian hostile? We went from every kid cycling or walking to school and even university to almost zero.

Why did we sleepwalk into this?

The World Health Organization estimates that 1.25 million people die from car-related injuries per year. Half of the deaths are pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists hit by cars. Cars are the leading cause of death for people ages 15–29 years old.

Let's not forget cyclists who are regularly killed. The recent decision in Dublin to [postpone the bicycle greenways](http://www.thejournal.ie/cycling-greenways-2964771-Sep2016/) does not bode well for anything I'm proposing here.

On a positive note, in Cork [COUNCILS GET INTO GEAR FOR MORE CYCLE TRACKS](http://www.eveningecho.ie/cork-news/councils-get-gear-cycle-tracks/2524009/). A blueprint for the development of new cycle lanes and tracks across Cork city and its suburbs has been published jointly by Cork city and county councils.


## Health
There are lots of people trying to do good work around health and fitness here, in the private, public and quango sectors. But it's mostly siloed, piecemeal or, in the case of something like National Fitness Day, tokenistic.

UPDATE 2: A great example of looking like you are doing something but really just ticking boxes is [A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025](http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/ministers-launch-a-healthy-weight-for-ireland-obesity-policy-and-action-plan-2016-2025/). Even the most naive of us go into full eyeroll mode when we see press releases that prattle on about guidelines, forums and stakeholders. The only surprise is that they didn't announce another taskforce.

In contrast, a great example of actually doing something practical is the [Parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com/) movement. A recent tweet by the organisation in the UK said:

> A whopping 92,432 people crossed a parkrun finish line in the UK this weekend 

The problem is that 92k is not whopping in a country of 64 million people where 62% of people are overweight or obese. A more fundamental change is needed rather than events which will never be more than niche for people who already want to change.

And whilst it's great to see Coillte adding things like Zipit in Farran wood, it costs money to use those things. It also costs money to park there. And you'd be suicidal to try and get there on foot. 

*Health shouldn't require wealth.*

This isn't a new problem. In 1963 JFK was horrified by the stats he saw about the declining fitness of young people. He kicked off a range of initiatives including a set of 50 mile events which were hugely popular that year. RFK even completed a 50 miler. But then JFK was assassinated. Very quickly the events petered out and now there is [only one 50 miler left](http://www.jfk50mile.org/history/). Which someday I hope to do.

How do we get the people who need to move the most moving, but who are least likely to do so?

What percentage of our multi-billion-Euro health budget is spent dealing with preventable no-exercise related diseases?

Things like Autonomous cars are only going to make things worse. Do we really want to end up like L.A. Story?

{{< youtube 3gP_ErrRILk >}}

&nbsp;

UPDATE 3: As an aside, I completely agree with [@thoughtwax](https://twitter.com/thoughtwax/status/778915462683979776) that 

> autonomous cars will present a once in a lifetime opportunity to reclaim public space for people 

Once we are 100% autonomous, driving related deaths should also drop to almost zero. And drink driving becomes a thing of the past. It could even herald the return of the rural pub. But I'm still concerned that an always-available fleet of autonomous Uber vehicles will have us all eventually looking like characters out of Wall-E.

There is a great piece in the Irish Times on obesity. [Ian O’Riordan: We are sports mad but sanity needed to tackle obesity](http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/ian-o-riordan-we-are-sports-mad-but-sanity-needed-to-tackle-obesity-1.2794132#.V9xTtrZY9qI.twitter): 

> Indeed there is something strangely contradictory about all this talk of overweight adults and children and the rise of obesity, which according to some reports, will be hovering somewhere around 90 per cent of the population by 2030, the highest projected level Europe. You don’t need me to repeat the scary thought that one in four Irish children is now considered to be overweight, because for a country that prides itself on being so mad about sport, that makes little sense.


## Sidenote - Dogs and dog shit
I'm getting to the point where I think dogs need to be temporarily banned from all public footpaths until a large proportion of their idiot owners stop behaving like 12th century peasants throwing their shit out onto the street. 

Pick up your dogs' shit and put your dog on a goddammed leash, you morons. I've had two little unleashed runt-sized dogs snapping at my heels recently when out on runs. The next one gets a kick in the face. 

Waterford is thinking of banning dogs from the Greenway. Given that it's already riddled with dog shit before it's open, they are 100% right. On one of my runs there, a woman had a large dog on a harness and struggled to control it as it tried to jump at me and attack me.  

But there's actually a revenue opportunity here. Dog-walking arenas. Places that dog-owners can go to walk their dogs, step in each others shit and break up the dog-fights. Lots of farmers could create these.

Here's hoping that responsible reasonable dog owners shame the idiots into behaving properly.

## France
France has lots of problems but seems to have some vision for walkers. We went to a holiday/caravan park in Marennes this year, south of La Rochelle, for the second time. Many people who go to these kind of places never leave the camp except maybe to drive to the supermarket. I know we've been guilty of that.

This year I decided to be different and went for two runs in the locality. I was, to be honest, a bit worried beforehand, as I didn't know the roads at all. Some Google Streetview calmed me. On my first run, I did a short 4km loop around some back roads. And it was an absolute joy. Why? No damned hedges and a grass verge that was flush with the road. Plenty of the usual little white French vans passed me but [a] I could see them coming for ages and [b] I could take a small step sideways to be 100% safe.

![France Verge](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/verge.jpg)


For my second run, I went much further afield and was thrilled to discover an offical nature trail. This was created just with basic crushed white rock and was a lovely surface to run on. 

![France 2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160723_083535.jpg)

The return leg was on a very busy road. But again, it wasn't a problem. No hedges, and big flat verge. We'll get back to hedges in a moment.

But it's not just summer holiday locations where the French are looking at this. [In Paris, Plans for a Seine Reinvention](http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/05/in-paris-plans-for-a-river-seine-reinvention/392639/). Mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced an ""almost philosophical project"" to take the famed river's quayside back from cars. 

Meanwhile in Dublin.........['It's bananas!'](http://www.thejournal.ie/cycling-greenways-2964771-Sep2016/) Fury as funding pulled for Dublin cycling projects.


## Re-forestation, Wildlands, Wetlands
This bit is critical for the next bit. We need a massive re-forestion of the country and the annexing of large areas for wildlife and plants. Every idle bit of land and farmland should be planted with native species (not poxy pines obviously). This is not for commercial purposes, tho that needn't be excluded in all cases. It ties into the National Park idea but more importantly, it gives wildlife and birds somewhere permanent away from the regular cutting of hedgerows.

And before you tell me that it will take decades, [India Plants 50 million trees in one day](https://gearjunkie.com/india-plants-50-million-trees-one-day). Or [How millions of trees brought a broken landscape back to life](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/national-forest-woodland-midlands-regeneration).
It's that vision thing again.


## Hedgerows
OK, now for the controversial bit that I'm sure you saw coming. It's time to get rid of all our our roadside hedgerows and ditches. All of them. Wait, wait, before you blow a gasket and start calling me names. First, we need that massive re-forestation programme to ensure that birds and wildlife have somewhere to go.

The main impediment to people being able to walk safely everywhere is [a] visibility and [b] having somewhere to put their feet. The removal of all hedges and the covering over of all ditches deals with this. I've noticed a lot of ditch covering locally on small roads recently, but of course it's not being done in a way that anyone could actually walk on. So this is eminently possible.

If you do one of the loops of the wonderful [Lusitania Trail](http://conoroneill.com/2016/08/26/the-seven-heads-walk-and-lusitania-trail-is-one-of-west-corks-best-kept-secrets/), this is the road you have to walk back on, with cars whizzing by at 100kph. It's not something I would ever do by choice.

![Irish Roads](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/irish_roads.jpg)

The government should CPO every roadside ditch and hedge. This removes the current nonsense where hedge cuttting is the landowners responsibility and can only happen during certain months due to nests. Get rid of the lot and the birds can go back to their natural pre-road habitats.

UPDATE 1: [A good link](http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/county-heritage-services/news/view-article/article/new-initiatives-launched-to-safeguard-irelands-unique-hedgerows/) from my sister around a new initiative to safeguard hedgerows in Ireland. Just to be clear, I'm talking about creating far more hedgerows and wilderness areas than we have now, just not beside roads.

## A New Ireland
This has been a very long run up to the idea that a whole new outlook is needed in Ireland. We need a grand revolutionary vision and plan for the health of our people and then the execution of that plan quickly. It can't be years of consultants reports and local government jollies and civil servant conservatism. 

Do the current generation of politicians and public servants in this country want to be forgotten in a few short years due to being bench-warmers who think keeping a steady hand on the tiller is their only job? Or do they want to be like Teddy Roosevelt, JFK, Donagh O'Malley and T. K. Whitaker, still being talked about decades later?

Of course we can't do a ""big bang deployment"", as we say in software. It has to be iterative but based on a core set of principles. We could start tomorrow.

* Every child should be able to walk and cycle safely to school. Build pathways to every school in the country spreading out like a spider's web
* Move all religious education to after-school opt-in per religion. Replace all of that school time with outdoor activities, no matter what the weather.
* Everyone should be able to walk and cycle safely from every town to every town in this country
* Give pedestrians the Right of Way by default everywhere. Cars must stop if you want to cross the road. [Why Sweden has so few road deaths](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/02/economist-explains-16)
* Everyone from the Dept of Env, County/City Councils, HSE, NRA, OPW, Coillte and every relevant department and quango are told exactly how they are going to be part of the solution
* In advance of a massive buy-up of land for the National Parks, do a huge expansion of the [Walks Scheme](http://www.housing.gov.ie/community/rural-development/walks-scheme/walks-scheme) to make trails available everywhere
* Start major re-forestation immediately
* Start removing all hedgerows on major roads initially

Yes this will eventually be a grand building program and require large capital investment. For the pathways, it doesn't have to be expensive pavement or tarmac or cobble lock everywhere. Crushed hard core is sufficient. But it also can't be a poxy white line painted on a road with a few ""caution pedestrians"" signs. The criminal negligence of Irish drivers at pelican crossings makes that unacceptable.

## Paying for it
So how to pay for all of this? Let's start with no new road building. Divert all of those funds to the building of pathways and trails. Look, I hate the roads to Killarney and Limerick as much as you do. And as for Dunkettle! But I'm talking about something a lot more important than a few extra minutes driving.

The removal of the hedgerows will deal with a large number of traffic accidents that happen here when idiots overtake blind on country roads. That's a positive feedback loop that will help pay for itself.

The top causes of death in Ireland are all lifestyle diseases:

1. Coronary heart disease 8%
2. Heart attack 8%
3. Lung cancer 6%
4. COPD	5%

Pull several hundred million out of the health budget that is currently being spent on dealing with preventable lifestyle-related illnesses. Provide cheap runners and step trackers to everyone who is capable of curing themselves, instead of rip-off statins and other heart meds. Carrot and Stick. Or carrot and vape for the smokers.

But there are also revenue oportunities. Figures from Fáilte Ireland show that in 2014, close to 1.2 million visitors to Ireland took part in hiking or cross country walking. These activity tourists spent in the region of €915 million in the Irish economy during their stay. Other stats show that 286,000 visitors took part in cycling activities with a spend of €268 million. These two sectors combined generated revenue for the Irish economy in the region of €1.2 billion in 2014.

And this is in a country that's actively hostile to both walkers and cyclists! 

Imagine how much revenue we could generate if we made their lives easy? All related taxes should be used to pay for the above.


## But, but, but, this is how things have always been
........in your lifetime. A pre-famine landscape looked nothing like it does now. A pre-deforestation landscape looked nothing like it does now.

Any time big changes are suggested I'm reminded of Douglas Adams on technology:

> I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:

> 1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.

> 2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.

> 3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

## Summary
A plan like this addresses health, jobs, tourism, taxes and the environment. Ireland could be leading the way in Europe. Just like we did with fags and bags but with 100x the long term benefit. 

The health crisis in Ireland reminds me a bit of global warming. It happens so gradually that the average person doesn't realise the frog is being boiled. Unlike global warming, it's not too late to deal with this health problem. But it's going to take an incredibly strong will to do so. Sadly, I don't think we have anyone in a position of power in this country capable of making it happen. So the best I'll be able to do is make sure my kids are healthy.

"""2023-05-22T09:42:00.000Z""",Having a WTF moment at the Waterville Trail Running Festival,"## Waterville
To my shame I had never been in Waterville until early 2022 when my Kerry Way Ultra recces began. Despite its remoteness, its position on the Ring of Kerry means it's always busy and buzzing. And as an absolute bonus, all the tourist traffic means that vegans are very well catered for everywhere in the town!

Last year I also learned about the [Waterville Trail Running Festival](https://www.watervilletrailrunningfestival.com/) from Yvonne Walsh and vowed to give it a go this year. The setup for the festival long weekend is fantastic. The core of it is a loop on the extended Kerry Way that's approx 44km long over hills, roads, lanes, beaches and trails. They offer a ~Half Marathon, one loop Marathon, 3 Loop Ultra and 3 Marathon loops over 3 days. So something for most runners.

![Startline](/images/2023/05/startline.png)
(Thanks to Seanie and the photographer from [Eat Sleep Trail Run](https://eatsleeptrailrun.com/) for the pic above)

Despite a distinct lack of training and lingering leg problems, I went into the 3 Loop Ultra with high hopes. I had done two solo single loop recces over the Spring and found them very hard but doable. But that was with abominable ground conditions and rain. So I figured a dry April should be a lot easier.

One of the reasons WTF is so cool is that you are up into the trails within a few minutes of the start line. And boy do you get dropped in the deep end. There are really only two difficult off-road bits and the 3 miles up Termon's Ridge is one of them. It's uphill all the way over a mix of fields, bog, rocks and ""trail"". But if you watch your feet, you should be fine.

![Termons](/images/2023/05/termons.png)

## Oh WTF, not now
That's followed by some easy downhill which of course I face-planted on, twisted my ankle and pulled a bunch of things in my right leg. Thanks to Steve for giving me a hand up. Morto and scarleh I was. The course then alternates between gentle off-road and country roads/lanes. 

Did I mention the epic views? They're epic!

## Halfway Paul and Kevin
At the halfway point on the loop, ""Halfway Paul"" takes care of you brilliantly and sends you on your way with a new bounce in your step. On the second loop Paul and Kevin took care of me. I moaned to both of them about the next section and how hard it is. Afterwards I learned that Paul is Paul O’Callaghan who has run across Ireland and has done the Double Wicklow Round! And of course Kevin was Kevin Leahy who has done the 500km Yukon Arctic Race followed a month later by the 500km Lapland Arctic Ultra! And here's Conor whining about a teeny weeny hill that's a bit mucky. 

## The Eagle has face-planted
That teeny weeny hill is Eagle's Hill. It's the worst part of the course. For me it has always been either fog-bound or raining. But in other years I was told it has been stiflingly hot. It's steep, mucky and slippy. But luckily it's not long. The ""mountain pass"" after it is a huge relief and you trot along a lumpy trail for several miles before finally re-joining the main Kerry Way and tripping down into Caherdaniel. And that's all the hard bits done.

![Mountain Pass](/images/2023/05/mountain_pass.png)


Next you jog down the road to Derrynane House, amble along the beach dunes and go on some rocky trail bits on the water's edge. Then it's a couple of miles uphill on a proper road with switchbacks. The views there across the bay have to be some of the best on the planet.

A few small patches of off-road finally get you across The Ring of Kerry and then drop you down near the big carpark at Coomakista. Two easy trail miles that run parallel to the main road bring you to the last section which is another two-ish miles on back lanes and finally you're back in Waterville.

## The Speed Project
The runners and their crews were the only people awake at the start line at 7am. By the time I got back at 2pm, Waterville was mobbed. The loops each have an 8 hour cut-off which is relatively tight for a slowcoach like me. I did the first loop in 7hrs 10mins but had to bust a gut to do that. With the pain from the pulled leg and struggling with the hot day, I suspected I wouldn't make the second cut-off. But my wife sorted me out with food and drinks, restocked my pack and off I headed. 

The second loop was much slower but much more enjoyable as a result. And the reduction in heat as the day progressed was a big help. After rolling my ankle 6 times on the first loop, I finally started paying proper attention and didn't do it once on the second loop.

Eagle's Hill was a mare as the fog had descended. I'm very glad I knew the route and had no issues. The markers were very hard to see and the night hadn't kicked in for the temporary lights on the markers to illuminate. 

## DFL beats DNF, and DNF beats DNS
The welcoming committee in Caherdaniel was an unexpected surprise. As I approached they shouted my name and offered me drinks and snacks. What a wonderful feeling to be given the same reception in last place as the front-runners. 

Oh did I forget to mention that? Yeah, DFL (Dead Fucking Last). Some others had DNFed (Did Not Finish) earlier but I was by far the back-marker of people remaining on the course.

## Derrynane 😍
Dusk was falling when I got to Derrynane Beach and it was even more beautiful than usual.

![Derrynane](/images/2023/05/derrynane.png)

It was a genuine pleasure to be lapped by the first and second place runners after Derryname. Both guys had a chat despite being under pressure. Watching them bound along on loop 3 as I staggered along on loop 2 was another highlight of the day.

## Danger Danger
Then for the scariest bit of the day. Peasoup fog on the trail above Coomakista with serious drops on one side. My headtorch was useless as the fog bounced the light straight back at me. I tip-toed along slowly trying to follow footprints in the mud and was deeply relieved to see the stile at the top of the slope appear out of the gloom. I knew it was downhill on a track after that. 

But it's worth highlighting that off-road always brings the potential for danger and you really do need to keep your wits about you. Two weeks ago I finally did the Coumshingaun Loop in foggy but not peasoup conditions. The whole way around I could only think of poor Gillian Ryan who died running there in 2021. There's one spot in particular where a bad slip could be fatal. I met several 20-somethings coming down the loop in street clothes/shoes and wanted to scream at them. I guess you think you're immortal at that age.

## DFL becomes DNF
I finally made it back to Waterville after 16 hours and 44 minutes. So 44 minutes over the cut-off for loop 2. After a lovely chat with the Race Director Simon, I headed to the resident's bar of the hotel for some much needed pints.

![Finish Line](/images/2023/05/finishline.png)

On the finish line I swore to my wife that I was not doing The Beara Way Ultra in three weeks time. Stay tuned for my blogpost on DNFing the Beara Way Ultra 😀

I also swore to her that I was never coming back to try and get a third loop in time. So when do entries open for 2024? 😀

## Thanks and Watermelon
A huge thanks to the organisers and all the locals and local businesses who support WTF. And a special thank you to the little girl and her grandad who put out water, sweets and fruit for the runners as we approached the end of each loop. It was appreciated on the first loop. It was a life-saver on the second. And watermelon, the absolute legends put out watermelon. Not only is it an amazing thirst quencher, it's now proven to reduce muscle pain after exercise!

## Lessons
The main lesson for me from WTF (and from Beara) was the old line that there is no substitute for miles on feet. I simply haven't been putting the training miles or speed work in day-to-day in 2023. I've been doing big long slow ambles at the weekends but I've gotten out of the habit of the daily grind. Most weeks are barely 20 miles of running. So that all changes now. I'm not repeating my DNF at Kerry Way Ultra, so it's back to basics for the next three months!

## Do it
The number of entrants across all the races in WTF is pretty modest and I really think a ton more people would enter if they realised how doable it is. Particularly the Half and Single Loop Full. You don't have to be some sort of mountain running goat to do WTF - any Half-Marathon road runner would be fine with a basic pair of trail shoes. So if you haven't considered it before, sign up for 2024. It's an amazing part of the country, the organisers are fantastic, there's plenty of accommodation options to suit all budgets and the entry fee is minuscule compared to so many other sports/races. Finally, you'll feel an enormous sense of achievement, no matter what distance you do."
"""2017-09-06T06:00:00+01:00""",Dear headphone manufacturers - Big opportunity to own the marathon market,"I really wonder about headphone manufacturers and their testing. I own everything from no-name €10 Chinese wired earbuds to €100+ Jaybird X3s and every single one of them is problematic for running.

In the US alone, over 550,000 people ran a marathon in 2016. Scale that globally (with a 13% growth rate) and that's a substantial, defined, receptive, target market.

My goto pair for the past 2 years are [SMS In-Ear Wired Sport](https://smsaudio.com/products/in-ear-wired-sport) earbuds. They were expensive-ish at the time for non-bluetooth but have got me through many marathons. The problems?

* The right-angled jack means I had to buy a straight inline adapter to connect with my phone when it's in a running armband
* Only the play/pause button works on Android
* Being wired means I have a flapping, dangling, awkward cable running from my ears to my arm that I have to control with safety pins.
* Taking the phone off my arm to do anything causes even more cable issues
* Trying to use them when the phone is in a running waist-band is impossible

My second option was a pair of Anker IE20 Bluetooth ""buds"" with connecting wire. The problems?

* Battery life of 2.5 hours means I'd have to be running near Olympic qualifying pace in the marathon
* Connecting cable drags on the back of my neck
* Buds are large due to batteries
* Charging port is hidden if you attach optional (necessary) rubber wings
* Audio drop-out if phone is in a running waist-band

My most recent attempt was a pair of Jaybird X3s. The problems?

* They died after a couple of months just like everyone online said they would. Really Jaybird, really? I'm on day 5 of trying to get an RMA.
* Connecting cable drags on the back of my neck
* Charging connector already unreliable after a few months (and stupid money to replace)
* Some audio drop-out if phone is in a running waist-band

Other options?

* Obviously something like Airpods are a joke for non-Olympic-pace marathon runners. 
* The old Motorola SD10-HD head-grippers give me a headache after a few miles.
* I've read that bone-conduction ones aren't great for audio clarity on podcasts when running but I haven't tried them.
* The Sony SBH20 bluetooth adapter has big audio drop-out issues even with phone on my arm


So what do we marathon runners need?

* Bluetooth to stop the dangling wires and for iPhone users
* 100% waterproof and sweatproof. Not splash-proof or kinda waterproof or even IP68. I mean they can handle being covered by water and sports drinks at 10 waterstops in a marathon, every week.
* A water/sweatproof charging system (See Fenix 3 watch)
* A charging system that's physically tested for at least a few thousand cycles
* Play-time battery life of at least 6 hours
* Rugged as hell. I never want to see a frayed cable
* Ideally no connecting wire between the buds, but if it has one, it needs some way of not tugging on my neck
* Waterproof control buttons. I should be able to press them when covered in sweat
* Wings to keep them in my ears
* €100ish price, ideally less

So build it and start advertising on the big (and small) running sites, along with running podcasts and magazines. Heck, sponsor some marathons.

What about the product name?

""Marathon Headphones - For people who like to run far"". Make them aspirational. Then everyone who runs 5k+ will want to own them.

You'll have a slam dunk of a product."
"""2021-09-22T06:00:00+00:00""",Hoka Speedgoat 4 - The perfect trail running shoe?,"I've been having mixed success with trail runners in 2021 which you can read about in previous mini-reviews:

* [Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX](https://conoroneill.com/2021/04/18/the-sheeps-head-way-ambling-51-miles-in-21-hours/) - Love the comfort and waterproofedness. Great for road-to-trail. Did 50-60 mile Sheeps's Head Way twice in them. But very little grip in the wet. 
* [Saucony Peregrine 10](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/review-of-saucony-peregrine-10-11/) - Killed my heel. Unwearable. Great grip.
* [Inov-8 TrailFly Ultra G 300 Max](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/review-of-inov-8-trailfly-ultra-g-300-max/) - Heavy, blister-inducing on rough ground, lethal on wet rocks. Great bounce. Will keep using for easy terrain and hiking.

So when I finally signed-up for the [Kerry Way Ultra Lite](http://www.kerrywayultra.com/kerry-way-ultralite.php) after many years of ""I must I must"" (blog post coming very soon!) I started getting stressed about my footwear. I'd used the above (and others) on various coourse recces over an extended period and nothing felt right.

I've avoided the Speedgoat for as long as I've run offroad because every review said they were narrow. Whilst I don't have particularly wide feet, my poor smallest toes get destroyed over marathon+ distances so I avoid anything that is specifically called narrow.

But when I thought about how much I loved the ATR apart from the grip, it seemed like an obvious choice with the Vibram Megagrip. I also really enjoyed the Evo Mafate around 2019 apart from the stiffness and them falling apart.

Weirdly this orange colourway was temporarily much cheaper than the others on [Alltricks](https://www.alltricks.com/Buy/hoka+speedgoat+4) so I went for it. My usual size was correct.

![Hoka Speedgoat 4](/images/2021/09/speedgoat4.jpg)

I've done three runs in them. The first was a short one on mixed surface which felt great and the second was on a ten mile recce of the KWU Lite from the start of the Old Kenmare Rd at the Kenmare end towards Killarney. That's all off-road but not really technical at all. They were absolutely perfect on this. Comfortable, grippy, good on wet surfaces, great on the downhills. And not too narrow! So I'm not sure where that reputation comes from.

The third run was the Kerry Way Ultra Lite itself two weeks ago. And they rocked! I had many problems on the day but none of them related to my feet. In recent years I've taken to taping up most/all of my toes on very long runs. And more recently on my [Sheep's Head Way FKT](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/), I taped my forefeet too, with Leukotape P. I did this for KWU and had zero blisters. Yes zero! That's over 58km of all sorts of terrain including roads.

![Feet](/images/2021/09/toes.jpg)

The cushion was incredible on the day. The wet grip wasn't needed much due to a dry week and I had no grip issues on the rocky bits. Not a single slip. And more impressively for such a high stack, not a single ankle roll. I had a couple of forward stumbles but that was down to my legs getting tired and me not lifting enough.

I was genuinely shocked at how well they worked and how great I felt at the end of the race. Sure I'm going to lose 4 toenails but that's unavoidable with hammering downhill.

I have [Ecotrail Wicklow 46K](https://wicklow.ecotrail.com/fr/course-ecotrail-wicklow/46k) this weekend and will update this post if I have anything new to report about them.

But honestly, this is what I'll be running in offroad for the foreseeable future. Unless they release V5 :-)

UPDATE: I'm just back from doing the Ecotrail Wicklow 46K and the Speedgoats were amazing again. I had a very rough day with my right calf completely cramped from mile 6 onwards but I didn't have a moment's issue with the shoes. They handled every surface perfectly and were ridiculously comfortable. I had one minor skid on a steep downhill on loose gravel which no shoe would have been able to prevent, but that's it. And yet again, no blisters. This time I only taped my toes. So I'm sticking with ""the perfect trail running shoe"" description."
"""2021-10-17T13:00:00+00:00""",How Flahavan's Oat Milk can out-market the big brands,"I was so pleased when I heard Flahavan's was getting into the oat milk market. As the most famous porridge brand in Ireland, it seemed like an obvious move.

![Flahavan's Oat Milk](/images/2021/10/flahavans-oat-barista-drink-1.jpg)

I only turned plant-based in January 2020 and switched to oat milk pretty quickly as I preferred, and still prefer, its taste to all the other plant milks. Having Flahavans as an option along with the usual Oatly, Califia, Minor Figures and Alpro means I can now finally support Irish farmers again with my cuppa tea and coffee.

Obviously Flahavans don't have the marketing budgets of the others which you can see by its lowly position on the supermarket shelves as they can't do the same level of kickbacks that global CPG firms can. What, you thought they put the *best* products at eye level?

So they'll need to do some dodging and weaving to grow their market presence here and then do a Baileys on it into the UK and US. I think the bright busy branding on the cartons helps for a start.

Here are my couple of ideas, coming from someone in the target demographic, not as someone who knows anything about the food industry.

## Motorway Services
Despite Irish garages coming on in leaps and bounds since the advent of breakfast-roll guy, they still have some huge gaps in their offerings, particularly for vegans, veggies and anyone with an intolerance to frytex :-) 

Whilst things are generally good in the food courts of the big motorway services during the day, it's a complete catastrophe before 9am and after about 6pm. I have yet to find one on the M7/M8 that does plant-based milk when there isn't a barrista on duty. And it's even worse for food - try getting a vegan sandwich or similar when Subway, Chopped and Zambrero are closed. And forget McDonalds completely until the McPlant arrives in 2022.

As a step 1, could Flahavans provide oat-milk and branded insulated metal jugs for free to all the garages on the M7/M8/M9/N25 as a trial? So there would be no coffee/tea machine changes needed. It just becomes another option along with the low-fat ones some of them offer in jugs. There'll already be massive brand recognition in general because of porridge.

![Flahavan's Oat Jug](/images/2021/10/flahavans_jug.jpg)

## Frank and Honest
Get that gig.

## Travel Packs / Miniatures
Because of the dire plant-milk situation outside of big cities in Ireland, I've taken to bringing full tetra-packs of oat milk with me to hotels. I also have some much smaller soy and oat cream ones in my car, which are unfortunataly too large for single-use and are cream not milk. They work for when I've done a long off-road run and know I'll be pulling in to a rural garage/cafe/horse-box.

I've done some googling on miniature oat-milks but only managed [to find one](https://www.organicdenmark.com/naturli-oat-drink-20-ml). It's Danish and they brilliantly have done it with the old 1970s UHT triangular packaging. Flashbacks to the campsite shop in Barleycove as a kid.

![Naturli Oat Milk](/images/2021/10/naturli-oat-drink-20-ml.png)

Think of all the hotels around the country with the crappy UHT milk miniatures or the Lakelands plastic tubes of milk. If the hotels were all convinced to provide artificial sweetener years ago, then oat milk miniatures should be a no-brainer. 

From an environmental perspective, I'm not sure if anything biodegradeable is available but that would obviously be preferable.

## Planes, trains and automobiles
Please also sell these as multi-packs in supermarkets so I can bring them on planes too. Oooh planes!!!! Calling Ryanair and Aer Lingus.

## And that's it
Option 1 requires no changes to anything you are doing in production apart from ordering some branded flasks. Option 2 is obviously a bigger ask but feels like a gigantic opportunity.

You'd have me as a customer for life if you followed through."

In January 2020, I went 99.9% plant-based as a way of kick-starting serious weight loss after 20 years of being either overweight or obese. The only initial exception was cow milk in my tea. I did similar back in 2016 but that was my silly ""6 Day Vegan"" plan where I ate chicken curry on a Friday. Both times I've used [Veganuary](https://uk.veganuary.com/) as the starting point.

After two months at 99.9%, I took the leap and dropped all dairy too. So now, apart from the very rare finger dip in a brownie or other lockdown treats that the kids make, I'm effectively 100% plant-based. I'm not saying I'll do it forever but I'm honestly finding it very easy and almost never miss meat or dairy. I play a lot with meat substitutes but that's more to do with texture and familiarity than wanting it to necessarily taste like meat. My [Beyond Meat](https://www.beyondmeat.com/products/the-beyond-burger/) burger stack is a thing of beauty.

I'll do more posts on the subject soon but suffice to say that it's 10x easier to go vegan in 2020 than in 2016. There's a massive new range of vegan and vegetarian options even in rural Irish SuperValu supermarkets. Huge kudos to Ireland's [Denny](https://www.denny.ie/food/meat-free-range/) on their sausages, burgers and mince. All are superb. Birdseye are also doing a good range of [""Green Cuisine""](https://www.birdseye.co.uk/range/meat-free-mealtimes/green-cuisine) but they do need to do some work on texture/taste. [Non-dairy yoghurts](http://schullandcrossbones.ie/) are pretty much indistinguishable from dairy. And [Violife](https://violifefoods.com/) are doing some very good cheese alternatives. Their feta in particular is fantastic. They just need more tang and crumbliness in all of their products. Our goto milks are [Oatly Barista Edition](https://www.oatly.com/int/products/oat-drink-barista-edition) and [Minor Figures](https://minorfigures.com/) oat milks. And there is always a range of [Quorn](https://www.quorn.ie/products/roast-style-sliced-fillets) products in the fridge and freezer for those quick protein needs.

Now here we are near the end of June and I've lost 38lbs/17kg so far this year with no let-up in sight. Of course being mostly off booze has helped a lot too, but previous booze-free attempts have never had this impact. My cholesterol, blood pressure and BMI (obvs) have also all plummeted.

Sorry, you were looking for a bread recipe?

Right.

Yes I've also been doing the sourdough thing. My starter is now very strong and I do one big loaf a week using the ""no-knead dutch oven"" method based on info from [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWbl3Sr2y1Y) and [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/no-knead-sourdough-bread-recipe) in the US. But that's not what this post is about.

My mother's brown bread is legendary and is sent to fans far and wide. But it is a traditional one involving buttermilk and eggs. I knew I had zero hope of replicating its perfection in vegan-form as no one has been able to, even following her original recipe to the letter. There's magic in those Ratoath fingers.

So I took a range of recipes online and started playing with them. This version has been working well for me for months now, even if I'm finding the initial wetness seems very variable, so I can't give a definitive cooking time.

Start by pre-heating your oven to 200C fan and (optionally oiling) a standard silicone or metal bread loaf tin.

Mix together the following dry ingredients very well first:

(March 2021 Note: I'm still making this twice a week. I continue to adjust and tweak. I have updated some of the amounts since I originally wrote this and indicated the changes below)

* 200g plain white flour
* 150g wholemeal flour (I have used both coarse and fine ground but prefer coarse)
* A ""shake"" of each of the following to get your total weight to approx 575g-600g (originally 450-550g). A shake is approx 2-3 tbsp. I'd only consider the wheat germ, wheat bran and pinhead oatmeal mandatory.
    * Wheatgerm
    * Wheatbran
    * Milled flaxseed
    * Sprouted milled flaxseed
    * Chia seed (milled or whole)
    * Pinhead oatmeal
    * Poppy seeds
    * Hemp seeds
    * Pumpkin seeds
    * Any other tasty seeds or oatmeal etc
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tsp baking soda / bread soda / bicarbonate of soda (not baking powder)(originally 1 tsp)

Mix the following in a jug, it's ok if it splits:

* 350ml of oatmilk or other plant-based milk (originally 300ml)
* 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (originally 1 tbsp)

Add the liquid to the dry mix along with 2 tbsp of maple syrup or other sweetness. I now also add 1 tsp of blackstrap molasses (black treacle).

Mix well with a spatula. It should be pretty loose, not a tight ball, and flow easily into the loaf tin. You may need to tweak milk amounts depending on the flours and type of milk you use.

Sprinkle sesame seeds or pumpkin seeds all over the top and pat it into the mix with the spatula.

Cut a deep line along the length in the middle of the mix with a knife. 

Pop it into the oven for between 45 mins and an hour. I'm finding an hour is currently optimal in our oven. Check at 40 to ensure it's not burning and to check the brownness. I use a K-type thermocouple to try and get a relatively accurate temperature in the oven but it varies hugely.

Maybe rotate once during the cooking time if you have an inconsistent oven like ours.

Pop out of the tin onto a cooling rack for 30 mins or so.

Eat.

If you find it's a bit damp in the middle, just increase the cook time on the next attempt."

A bit of googling revealed that there was a new place called [Mirch Masala](https://www.mirchmasalacork.com/), so I loaded up their website on my phone and my jaw hit the floor as I started browsing the menu.

The range of vegan and vegetarian options is almost beyond belief. On our trip to London last summer I could not find any Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi restaurant near Shoreditch with an extensive vegan menu. Dishoom came closest. So to find a local West Cork dine-in and takeaway Indian offering this many dishes is shocking.

I'm also a bit stunned the Irish Veganorati on Instagram have not been talking about this *all the time*. They should be shouting it from the rooftops. Honestly, if you're within an hour (or even more) of Clonakilty and you're vegan or vegetarian, you should make the journey.

The other thing to love about them is that all of the bog-standard Anglo-Irish-Indian-Pakistani-Bangladeshi dishes are there but they are are well down the page. You'd be much better off trying all the other fantastic dishes they offer instead of the same-old same-old.

Pretty much everything has the option to be vegan including the naans and the raita!

I really enjoyed my chickpea curry (Amritsari Chole) and my wife loved her vegan kofta curry. The naans tasted freshly made with tons of garlic and fresh coriander. The sweet potato fries were delish too.

![Amritsari Chole](/images/2022/01/mirch.jpg)

It's such a pleasure to see forward-thinking businesses like this settting up in semi-rural Ireland. I also just learned about [Budds](http://budds.ie/) in Ballydehob and will be making a trip to check out their vegan options too. Compare that to a new local ""NYC-inspired"" burger joint that opened recently and doesn't even offer the classic chipper salad burger, let alone a proper veggie/vegan option. 6 square inches in the freezer and an open mind is all they need to join the 21st century.

I had no idea what to expect today. Would it be 10 people or 100? Beginners or Jim Walmsleys? It was a good mixed group of people. The turnout for the junior race was really impressive. I regretted not bringing some of my brood, I think they would have enjoyed it.

I identified the very serious mountain people by their shoes. Anyone in Salomon or Inov-8 was clearly not messing around. I had my US-trail-style Altra Lone Peaks which were perfect for today's conditions but had very poor downhill grip before Christmas when I tried to do part of St Finbarr's Way from the Gougane Barra side and landed on my arse several times coming back down in boggy muddy wet conditions.

The course today had to be changed due to flooding on the path out to Kilkern Lake. It was manky when I did it before Christmas too. This meant that they added an extra nasty road hill but it gave me a chance to go on the newish trail parallel to Long Strand which is lovely, albeit too short. 

The view as you come to the top of the hill on the road out of Rathbarry is utter perfection. If I hadn't been so intent on not coming last, I'd have stopped for 5 minutes just to soak it in.

The run was brilliant. The bit along Long Strand was pure torture, just like the last time I did a run here, so I had to walk most of it. There is no hard packed sand on that beach so you sink in with every footstep. At least now I know I'm never doing [Marathon Des Sables](http://marathondessables.co.uk/) :-)

"""2017-06-11T11:49:50+01:00""",Quick reviews of Inov-8 X-CLAW 275 trail runners and Leki Voyager poles,"One thing I've learned as I've dipped my toe into off-road running in Ireland is that we don't really do trails. Apart from forest paths, the bulk of what I've found is wet muddy bog. This causes me two problems - it's difficult to run in it and American-style trail runners are useless in this environment. My poor Altra Lone Peak 3.0 may as well be slick tyres coming down from Mullaghmesha Mountain.

## Ellis Brigham
I was in London a few weeks ago for work and discovered that there is a superb outdoor shop called [Ellis Brigham](https://www.ellis-brigham.com/) in Covent Garden. They have a large selection of Salomon and Inov-8 trail runners, which are designed for the more mud-centric Euro terrain. I was very impressed by the help I got there. It really is a great store and the prices are RRP without any of the uplift you'd expect from that location. 

## Shoe fit and sizing
My concern with all the Salomons is that the reviews say they have a narrow fit. The same is true for a lot of the Inov-8s which are described as ""precision fit"". I don't think I have particularly wide feet but when you have spent years in Vibrams and then Altras, anything narrow feels very constricting. It's taken me a few months to feel completely comfortable in my Skechers GoRun 5 and that's after my little toes were destroyed in the Brighton Marathon.

The other concern in general with running shoes is sizing. I continue to be annoyed by the almost random sizes put on running shoes. I can be anything from 8.5 to 9.5 UK based on the individual model within one brand.

## Inov-8 X-CLAW 275
I trawled through every model that Inov-8 makes on their web-site. My requirements were Standard not Precision fit, not overly large drop and very deep 8mm lugs. Only one model fits that description perfectly, the [X-CLAW 275](https://www.inov-8.com/row/x-claw-275-mens-trail-running-shoes-black/). I emailed ahead to make sure Ellis Brigham had some of my possible sizes in stock in Covent Garden. They did. Once I got there, the big surprise was that a small size fit me perfectly without pinching.

![X-CLAW 275 Clean](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-06-09%2021.41.31.jpg)

The advice from the guy in the store was to avoid hard surfaces or the lugs would wear out quickly. However the site says they are multi-surface with a mix of medium and hard compounds.

## Leki Voyager poles
As we were settling up, I asked what was the cost of the absolute cheapest walking/running poles they had. I've wanted to try out poles for ages but I'm not spending £120+ to discover I hate them. He showed me the [Leki Voyager](https://www.leki.co.uk/trekking-poles-c192/leki-voyager-walking-sticks-pair-p1177) ones at £44 a pair and they seemed fine to me. Rubberised grips and aluminium body. He then showed me a pair of £120 carbon ones for comparison. They weighed almost nothing. I decided feck-it, let's get the cheap ones and see how it goes.

![Leki Voyager](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/leki_voyager.jpg)

I got back to the hotel and then realised I was a moron. How do you fit two poles into carry-on luggage? Luckily you can completely disassemble the Lekis and they fit at a squeeze diagonally in reasonably tall luggage. I gritted my teeth going through LHR x-ray but they didn't bat an eyelid. Hurrah!

## Mullaghmesha Mountain testing
I [wrote recently](http://conoroneill.com/2017/05/01/conors-roundup-of-recent-runs/) about our Mullaghmesha Mountain excitement. Yesterday I decided to have another go. Yup, after a night of torrential rain and ongoing howling wind, I committed to making the same mistake twice.

![Trail Start](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/YDXJ0052.JPG)

This time I drove up the tiny lane beside the castle at 10mph to avoid wearing out those lugs. I parked at the start of the off-road piece of the [Castledonovan Loop](http://www.activeme.ie/guides/walks/castledonovan-loop-walk-drimoleague-west-cork-ireland/) and headed out with the poles and my new Yi II action cam + gimbal (reviews of those coming shortly).

The grip on the Inov-8s was immediately obvious. My confidence going up a steep wet muddy ""trail"" was much higher than with the Altras. The waterproofing was pointless as I sunk ankle deep over and over. I then put away the action cam and started using the poles. It was a real surprise to discover I loved them. I had been worried about them being awkward, heavy or even tripping me up. But they made the incline much easier.

![Trail Mid](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/YDXJ0029.JPG)

After less than a mile I headed back. The wind was incredibly strong and the fog had started to come in. Going down in these conditions is actually more difficult than going up. Despite the added traction of the 8mm lugs on the X-CLAWs, I still slipped a few times. I also took my eye off the ground for a moment and landed on my arse. The poles were a big help on the really steep bits.

I found my feet were moving around inside the X-CLAWs a lot more than I expected. But checking afterwards revealed that I hadn't cinched down the laces well at all. I'll also switch to heel-lock lacing on them as soon as they dry out.

Here's a really cool video animation of the ""run"" from [relive.cc](https://www.relive.cc) (a very cool site).

## Conclusion
Two big thumbs up. For Irish mud, the X-CLAWs are perfect. For general hill walking and running, the poles are a bargain. However I'm sure the pole weight would be an issue over distances like 50k. I'll report back on this from the [Chiltern Challenge 50k Ultra](http://www.xnrg.co.uk/events/details/chiltern-challenge-ultra2017.aspx) in July!

"""2021-06-07T17:00:00+00:00""",Review of Inov-8 TrailFly Ultra G 300 Max,"After the heel-destroying catastrophe of the [Saucony Peregrine 10](/2021/06/07/review-of-saucony-peregrine-10-11/) and my bad fall in the [Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX](/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/), I needed a new pair of trail running shoes that could handle both long distance and typical slippy, mucky, wet Irish terrain.

The hype around the [Inov-8 TrailFly Ultra G 300 Max](https://www.inov-8.com/eu/trailfly-ultra-g-300-max-mens-ultra-running-shoes) has almost been as big as its crazy long name. But the reviews were very good and I still love and use my old Inov-8 X-CLAW 275 on the shorter boggier stuff. The only thing that slowed me down from clicking the buy button was the price. I think €195 is going to be a sticking point (pun fully intended) for a lot of people when other bigger brands are a lot cheaper.

But I really wanted to try something other than Hoka for long distance off-road. Whilst I loved my Evo Mafates, they crushed my little toes and they separated at the join between the upper and the midsole. Like all Hokas ever. And every review of the Speedgoats talks about how narrow they are, so I've avoided them for years now.

Of course the nerd in me wanted to see if the graphene hype was justified. So I eventually talked myself into buying them (LOL, like I wasn't always going to relent). 

![Clean](/images/2021/06/inov-8-trailfly-ultra-g-300-max-clean.jpg)

Sidebar: Inov-8 please fix your website for non-UK customers. Those multiple location/currency popups are infuriating and it means that deep links to your site never work for international users. Ultra Damos FKT story was basically unfindable from outside the UK.  

Sidebar 2: Oh hey Hoka, exactly same problem with your EU site and links. Lads, this stuff isn't hard, sort it out.

Back to the review.

First impression was ""oh my god what's that abominable smell?"". It's like every nasty semi-industrial thing you bought from a no-name vendor on Aliexpress packed into one box. Whilst it didn't fill my office as badly as Ginger Runner's, there's still a definite niff, even after a few runs. But that's not important. (And a low-temp wash with some Vanish sorted it out)

The upper is a little stiff but works well and seems to size big (I had the same issue on the X-Claw). I suspect the UK-US-EU sizing is different depending on what country unit the manufacturer uses internally. So an Inov-8 44 is much bigger than a Hoka or Nike 44. If you use EU sizing, maybe go down a half or 1. But I could get good lockdown with the laces and had no issue with my foot sliding around.

The cushioning on my first 5 mile run in [Castlefreke](https://www.strava.com/activities/5376075616) in West Cork, Ireland, was excellent and the midsole was nice and flexible. It seems Inov-8 can do max cushion well!

The lugs are fairly shallow but wide so I wondered what their preferred surface would be. Grip was superb on grit, grass and mud. But a static test on a wet slab showed it wasn't grippy at all on that surface. Which was a disappointment for me, since that was one of the drivers for buying them. 

I followed that with a 3 mile run on [The Seven Heads](https://www.strava.com/activities/5415408198), also in West Cork, which consisted of a dirt track, grass and road. The grass section is a great test as the fields are very sloped and the grass was wet. I've slid badly there in several other brands and the lock-down on a old pair of Altra Lone Peaks was so awful my entire foot twisted out of the shoe and it came off. I had none of those issues with the TUG 300M which was a great result.

Finally I did an 11 mile hike yesterday on the [Sheep's Head Way](https://www.strava.com/activities/5425613675) (yes, in West Cork, Ireland) on a lot of very challenging surfaces. Tons of bog, mud, rocks, heather and steep up/down on hills. And it chewed it all up. I didn't slip once and I was completely comfortable the entire way around. Which is very cool, considering my 60 miler three weeks previously and my ongoing IT Band issue. I didn't test wet rocks too aggressively due to nervousness over the recent fall but the testing I did showed no problems. Oh and my toes were not crushed!

The only problem I had was my feet getting soaked from the get-go. And that's where I think Inov-8 can meet the market half-way on price. A Gore-Tex/GTX version of the TUG 300M would be a killer shoe. Since it's not designed for fell-running or the really gnarly stuff, they should do everything they can to make it the ultimate long-distance multi-terrain off-road shoe. And Gore-Tex adds a massive degree of extra comfort for that use-case. Do that at €195 and the complaints about price would drop hugely. As it is, despite being a great shoe which is now instantly my main MUT go-to, that price point is problematic.

In summary, it's a fantastic long-distance trail running shoe that might not quite live up to the Graphene hype but easily competes with the big boys and hopefully will give hundreds of miles of use.

**UPDATE:** I'm afraid my update after two longer (10 mile and 13 mile) runs is much less positive. In both cases the runs were on quite rough terrain with lots of mud, bog, rocks and steep ups and downs. These were on The Beara Way and The Kerry Way. On the first one, my feet were sliding around badly inside the shoe. But tightening the laces enough resulted in me having horrendous pains on the top of my feet after a few miles. The Trailflys also proved lethal on wet slabs. Absolutely zero grip. I basically skated across the slabs. On the second run, the problem was blisters. In over ten years of running, with lots of off-road, I have never got a blister behind my little toe. Plenty on the toe itself, sure, but never behind. It felt like there was something rough on the inside of the shoe rubbing the side of my foot but I found nothing afterwards. I suspect it's down to the upper material which is too stiff. Finally, once they get wet, they weigh an absolute ton. So overall I'm afraid these are not suitable for traditional Inov-8 terrain and seem to be much more suited to long distances on easy groomed dry trails.

"""2021-06-07T12:00:00+00:00""",Review of Saucony Peregrine 10 / 11,"This won't be a long review. Whilst I was enjoying running in the Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX, I knew the grip wasn't great on the rougher stuff. After googling around a bit, the [Saucony Peregrine](https://www.saucony.com/en/peregrine-10/43084M.html) had lots of solid reviews as a reliable decent everyday trail running shoe. Version 10 was on discount due to the recent release of version 11, so I grabbed a pair from [Alltricks](https://www.alltricks.com/F-11912-chaussures-running/P-1506839-saucony_peregrine_10_mutant_orange_men?utm_source=alltricks&utm_medium=emailing-auto&bvdata=IT_7_EN_alltricks_order_confirmation) in France.

![Peregrine 10](/images/2021/06/peregrine10.jpg)


My initial impressions were quite favourable. Despite being relatively heavy, I didn't notice the weight. And also despite some negative reviews about the grip, I found it superb on mucky and wet boggy ground. They were also totally fine when running on roads and lanes approaching trails. I went up half as size from my usual, as recommended by various reviews, and that seems to have been good advice since they fit me well.

But but but, oh my god the heel pain. It started on the first run and I assumed it was just a glitch. Then I tried a section of the very hilly [Beara Way](https://www.strava.com/activities/5188546588) towards Adrigole and I had to turn around after only 4 miles, the pain was so bad. Finally, I did a very rough 11 mile loop [around Gougane Barra](https://www.strava.com/activities/5222600669) and the pain was even more vicious. The uphills in particular were horrendous.

I assume this is what the other reviews refer to as the ""narrow heel"" but I've honestly never encountered anything like this and I have bought a *lot* of running shoes over the years.

I had to completely stop using them but the after-effects are still with me over a month later. I did the [Sheep's Head Way 60 miler](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/) in my Hokas and had the pain on-and-off in the same spot throughout. When I got home I realised I had a pinball sized bulge on the back of my heel that took several days to subside. I assume my body surrounded the point of aggravation with fluid. All of this was due to whatever issue the Peregrines had caused. An 11 mile hike yesterday in my new Inov-8 TrailFly Ultra G 300 Max (review coming next) had some residual pain too. But it wasn't terrible so hopefully I'm on the mend.

The reviews of the Peregrine 11 say that nothing much has changed in the design, so my warnings apply to them too. In fact, I found another review referring to heel pain. 

I don't know what is causing the problem but it's bizarre that the company who gave me my favourite running shoe in ten years (the Endorphin Speed), could get something so basic so wrong.

Honestly, just avoid them."
"""2017-08-30T18:00:00+01:00""",Review of The Trail Runner's Companion by Sarah Lavender Smith,"I [wrote about my first 50k](https://conoroneill.com/2017/07/23/the-chiltern-challenge-50k-conors-first-ultra-marathon/) a few weeks back. I still smile every time I think about it. I'm already signed up for a 40 miler in the [Glen of Aherlow](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1506) in September (3 loops, so I have a get-out-of-jail) and I'm trying to decide what my first 50 miler will be. Suffice to say, I'm really getting into this whole trail running thing. And one of the main reasons for that is the brilliant work done by YouTubers, Instagrammers and Podcasters in this area.

My two fave Ultra/Trail podcasts are [Ultra Runner Podcast](http://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/) and [East Coast Trail and Ultra Podcast](http://eastcoastultrapodcast.com/). They are verrrrry different beasts (pun intended) but both awesome resources for getting excited, inspired and educated about ultra running. Eric on URP is often joined by [Sarah Lavender Smith](http://www.sarahlavendersmith.com/) and I always look forward to those episodes due to the depth of her knowledge and utter likability.

Which brings us to books about running. I have to admit I'm not having a lot of success with these. Most of them are written by runners, not writers, and you can tell. I was genuinely sad to find Lizzy Hawker's book to be basically an unreadable mix of ""and then, and then"" with fortune cookie quotes. Lizzy is an absolute legend of a runner and I'm in awe of her achievements. At the other end you have books like ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Running"", written by Haruki Murakami, a famous author. I have to admit I found this mind-numbing too. I have a few others on the Kindle I've started but given up on. I even gave up half way through Dean Karnazes audiobook. And he's another person I idolize.

So to-date, I've only really enjoyed three books about running: 

1. [Born to Run](http://www.chrismcdougall.com/buy-born-to-run-from-these-sellers/) by Christopher McDougall
2. [Nowhere Near First: Ultramarathon Adventures From The Back Of The Pack](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nowhere-Near-First-Ultramarathon-Adventures-ebook/dp/B01KW37P5M) by Cory Reese
3. [The Trail Runner's Companion](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trail-Runners-Companion-Step-Step-ebook/dp/B071WDHGCW) by Sarah Lavender Smith

Born to Run is that got me into running in the first place and would make even the most dedicated couch-potato excited. It's also the reason I ran in VFFs for a few years. Christopher's other book, [Natural Born Heroes](http://www.chrismcdougall.com/buy-natural-born-heroes-from-these-sellers/), is also a must-read. It's sorta about running but really it's about a lot more. 

I discovered Cory's book in Sarah's book. As I mentioned in my 50K post, I read the entire thing the night before my first Ultra and it was a huge help in settling my nerves. Cory is funny, genuine and full of grit. Even if you don't run, buy the book, it'll make you want to do more.

And so on to The Trail Runner's Companion. I didn't just enjoy this book, it's the one I'll be reading over and over. It's a practical instruction manual for doing ultra trail running well. It's mixed with lovely anecdotes and all of the nuts and bolts instructions are done in a really approachable way.

The more I read it, as I approached the 50k, the more I realised just how badly I'd prepared. It turns out that running around a few Irish forests and hills for 4 or 5 miles, plus doing a few road marathons, is not really how you approach an Ultra. Of course I bought the book so close to the event, that I had no chance to actually implement her advice. 

The really important aspect of the book is that anyone of any level of ability can use it. I find a lot of online advice assumes you are already a fast runner and you are just transitioning to trails. Sarah doesn't do this. So a blob like me can still apply her instructions without ending up in the physio's office with everything torn and out of action for months.

If you want one take-away from the book, it's ""do more hill repeats"". Something I avoid like the plague but which I'm really going to have to embrace.

I said it in the last post and I'll say it again - ""Inspirational"" should mean ""Inspired me to action"". And that's what books like Sarah's do. You read them and you think ""ye know, I could do that, I just have to try"". There are things I have no interest in ever doing like 24 hour track loops. But there are others that I am now seriously considering. Events like OCC, CCC, UTMB, JFK50 and hell yes, even Western States (I know, I know). Sarah's book gives me the training map for getting myself to a place where these are not ridiculous ambitions for a heavy 49 year old who staggers around 26 miles on a regular basis.

I'll extend something I wrote in 2015 after the London Marathon:

> If you told me in 2008 that I’d ever run a 10k, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2009 that I’d ever run a half marathon, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2011 that I’d ever run a marathon, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2014 that I’d ever run two marathons in 5 weeks, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2015 that I'd ever run 5 marathons in a year, I'd have laughed at you. And if you told me in 2016 that I'd ever run 50k cross-country, I'd have laughed at you.

I'll update the quote again next year :-)

Finally, I couldn't do a post about running this week without mentioning [The Pacemakers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b092l5gd) documentary. It ties in perfectly to what I'm saying above. It's about a group of highly competitive athletes who are attending the World Championships. The twist is that they are all over 90.

The trailer:

I want to be 95 and running down a track against some other 95 year olds and trying to whip their assses. Don't you?

"""2017-05-21T14:00:32+01:00""",Rosscarbery Surf Turf n Tar - An instant classic Half Marathon,"This is going to be a post full of superlatives. 

When I first heard about [Surf Turf n Tar](https://surfturfntar.com/), I was instantly excited. I'd done most of the course in chunks already and it's currently my favourite place to run. You have every sort of terrain and views, all in a compact area.

![Surf Turf n Tar](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/surf-turf-ntar.jpg)

The race started just opposite the Celtic Ross Hotel and headed down a little road. You hear of elite ultra runners ""blowing-up"" at 50 miles. I blew up at 50 yards where both calves cramped badly as I tried to keep up with my wife. 

So much for my brand new schoolgirl 2XU compression socks helping with that.

![2XU](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-05-20%2007.57.06.jpg)

As we ran along I was trying to figure out how the hell we were supposed to get across the inlet/estuary. There's always at least some bit of stream there. We bounced out on to the sand at that really cool house right on the water and ran across the sand. A few foot-dunks in puddles confirmed that wearing Altra Lone Peak 3.0 trail runners was the right choice :-) And then I spotted it, a pontoon bridge across the stream! The wee geniuses. 

Over we ran to the relatively newly finished cliff walk and immediately dropped to a walk. Damn that's steep.

Along the road in Owneahincha and then into the ""beware the bull"" field. I was really looking forward to this section as I'd finally get to see the old Castelfreke building up close. It's private property with lots of ""stay out"" signs so it was a real coup for the organisers to get permission.

Every time we got to a steep bit, people passed me as I was only power walking (and still in pain with my calves). But when we hit the downhills, I bombed past them like a small child with my arms outstretched relying on the grip of the LPs to keep me off my ass.

The forest bits were as lovely as always with amazing smells of wild garlic. Then the heavens opened and we were all saturated. But it was exactly what I needed.

I really like new trail above Long Strand and hope the planting of native species to replace the removed poxy pines continues.

Back on to the road and up to the bastard Long Strand. This is my third race which goes out on to that torture chamber. It's not the fact that it's a beach which hurts, it's the fact that the weird sand never becomes dense. Every footstep sinks in deep. Your legs are like lead by the end of it.

Here it is back in March on a foggy day.

![Long Strand](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-03-30%2015.22.26.jpg)

Then up the really steep hill I love to the best view in the area, past the holy cross. and another high speed bombing session down the other side of the hill. 

Only 3 miles left now, so it should be a doddle. Noooooo, into the dunes of Owenahinca for more soft sand. The evil evil brilliant geniuses.

Back up over the cliff walk and surely it's just a jog along on the road? Nooooooooo again, as we're directed out on to the Warren beach and then on to sand that's even softer than Long Strand. I'm almost staggering at this stage. And the tide is coming in close to the markers. 

Finally the 13 mile marker. But where the hell is the finish line? The hotel is a lot more than 0.1 of a mile away. So I jog along the road, turn a corner and hurrah, the finish line. 

Seriously, this is the kind of course that makes you want to run all the time. It may have taken my calves 6 miles to loosen up but who cares? I can't congratulate the organisers enough. Everything was absolutely brilliantly done and it's the best Half marathon course I've ever run.

And the most amazing part of the whole thing? The medal was made of chocolate!

"""2016-09-19T18:33:32+01:00""",Run Forest Run trail race report. Loved it!,"As you may have read in my previous post, I've been dipping my toe into running off-road. The phrase ""trail running"" still seems pretty rare in Ireland where I see ""mountain running"" mentioned more often, and ""fell running"" in the UK.

Last week my wife spotted on the [Running in Cork blog](https://corkrunning.blogspot.ie/) that there was a trail run on in Castlefreke/Rathbarry on Sunday 18th called [Run Forest Run](https://www.facebook.com/Run-Forest-Run-175750705775650/?fref=ts). It instantly got me interested as it was [a] nearby and [b] only 5 miles long. I have just spent 11 days sick on and off after a trip to Vietnam. Top tip - don't brush your teeth with the tap-water, even in a high-end hotel. I'm doing the Berlin Marathon next Sunday, so the big question I wanted to answer yesterday was ""am I well enough for Berlin yet?"". 

For the laugh I asked my 14yo and the 17yo sons if they wanted to do it with me. I was shocked when they both said yes. Their mother then added the sweetener of €20 for the winner between the three of us. Neither of them have done much more than a bit of running in school, so I was very impressed by their enthusiasm.

You can see the Strava route and Ordnance Survey map below. A lovely mix of path, trail, road, forest and beach in a beautiful part of West Cork.

Unfortunately, Sunday morning welcomed us with lashing rain. But what the hell, in for a penny, in for €20. The start/finish was the [Galleyflash Rowing Club](http://www.galleyflash.com/) on Kilkern lake. A few people were there when we arrived and sadly the numbers didn't really grow. In the end, they dropped the 5km and only 19 of us lined out for the 5 miler. I figure there were three reasons for turnout: [1] the rotten weather [2] the Charleville Half Marathon with nearly 1000 people was on the same day and [3] the lack of much publicity for it. 

![Lake](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_113913.jpg)

But we didn't mind in the slightest.

![Start](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_115939.jpg)

Off we went and we quickly ended up at the back of the field. But the two boys looked solid and we were doing a decent pace for n00bs. They slowed down a bit going into Castlefreke Woods and then grinded to a slow walk going up the first hill in the woods. 

![Woods](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_121814.jpg)

We picked the pace back-up and did the road stretch quickly. Then on to the nasty-assed hill up to the large cross. 

![Hill](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_124653.jpg)

The downhill was brilliant fun and we ran the whole thing. Here's a video which gives some sense of the fantastic location and views. Apologies for the relentless heavy breathing.

{{< youtube _NhKnpDfQXI >}}

The final mile on the beach was brilliantly horrific with huge patches of soft sand you couldn't avoid. Then back on to the road for a bit and to the Rowing club. The 14yo came in first of us, having found a great second wind. The 17yo hurt his achilles on the beach and came in last. But I was incredibly proud of them both. 8.4km is no joke off-road in the lashing rain when you have done no training for it.

Tea and biccies sorted us out before we drove home.

I really want to thank the organisers and helpers for a superb event. Everything was absolutely top notch from the signage to the stewards. I'd particularly call out the young guy at the end of the beach who had to stand there watching 3 slowly moving bodies in the rain for an interminable duration so he could tell us where to go.

I'll be making lots of noise about this event next year to try and drive up the numbers. Honestly, even if you've never run before, you'll love this route and the terrain.

The [IMRA also did an event here](https://www.imra.ie/events/details/id/1339/) in February. I'm aiming to do that if it's on next year.

If you know of any other trail events like this in West Cork, do let me know!

Oh and yes, I think I'll be fine for Berlin.

"""2021-09-17T05:00:00+00:00""",Sir Clive Sinclair R.I.P. - My Hero,"Sir Clive Sinclair died [on September 16th 2021](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/16/home-computing-pioneer-sir-clive-sinclair-dies-aged-81) after a long illness. I knew this had been coming for quite a while based on internet rumblings but it's still a shock to know that the man, whose brilliant mind changed the life of a small kid from rural Ireland, is gone.

![ZX81](/images/2021/09/sirclive_zx81_tv.png)

I've written many many many times over the years [on this blog](https://www.google.com/search?q=conoroneill.com%3A+sinclair) and on [my tech blog](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=conoroneill.net%3A+sinclair) about the ZX Spectrum and Sinclair in general. And I'm going to do it one more time.

I always refer to that school trip from St Kieran's College in Kilkenny to Dublin in late 1981 or early 1982 where one of my schoolmates brought me to the Grafton Arcade and into Tomorrow's World, the main computer shop at the time. I can't put into words how mind-blown I was. At this stage I think I'd only been near the Apple II in school. To be able to touch and play with real computers was the most exciting thing I'd ever encountered. 

Then I saw the ZX81 and it was love at first sight. In comparison to all the clunky behemoths with their clear 1970s heritage, here was something that was tiny and modern. And ""cheap"". I had to have one.

As always, I went deep and started buying the relevant magazines. But then something incredible happened. They announced the ZX Spectrum. A ZX81++, with colour and sound and movable keys! The ZX81 was soon forgotten and I badgered my parents for months until eventually, just before Christmas 1982, a co-worker of my Dad arrived back from the UK with a 16K Speccy from WH Smith.

![48k](/images/2021/09/48k.jpg)

And as I said above, my life changed forever. I'm not sure I buy into the idea that the ""you would have gone down this route anyway whether via Commodore or Acorn or Oric or Dragon or Amstrad"". Price was critical and it was always Sir Clive's best and worst motivation. £99 was manageable whereas even the Commodore 64 was out of reach. And one of the big differences between Speccies and the others was how easy/cheap it was to build your own electronics for them. Which eventually resulted in me doing Electronic Engineering rather than Computer Science. 

![Hey Hey 16k](/images/2021/09/hey_hey_16k.png)

I love having that appreciation of both hardware and software that I first got when I opened up my 16K Speccy and inserted a bunch of RAM chips to turn it into a 48K, followed later by an all-new keyboard/case.

![Electronics](/images/2021/09/electronics.jpg)

Sir Clive was a terrible businessman and flawed in so many ways. If there was a cheap way of doing things, he always picked that. Sometimes it resulted in perfection like the Spectrum. Other times it was a disaster like the Microdrives and C5. Even as a teen I could see he was making dreadful mistakes with things like the Interface 2 or QL. But it didn't matter, because he created the Spectrum.

The design of the original 16K and 48K was down to the genius of [Rick Dickinson](https://retromash.com/2018/04/27/rick-dickinson-zx-spectrum-designer-a-tribute/) and I think it still looks modern today, the way Braun designs do. In fact it looks a lot better than the Raspberry Pi 400, which is in many ways its spiritual successor rather than various modern retro devices. Read that article linked to Rick above to see his utter brilliance as a designer.

![Pi 400](/images/2021/09/pi400.jpg)

Last year in the depths of lockdown, I finally treated myself to an Amstrad-era 128K +2 so I could play newer (late 80s LOL) games but it just doesn't have the visual and emotional impact of the original.

![128k](/images/2021/09/128k.jpg)

I could write paragraph after paragraph about my 1982 Speccy, which still works perfectly and it now has an SD card adapter and HDMI out! 

I could write even more about the innovation that happened in the UK around the late 70s and early 80s leading to an ARM in every computing device.

But I think I'll spend today thinking about that brilliant man and his sometimes crazy ideas and how much I owe him for making me (and keeping me) excited about the potential for technology and people to do amazing things together.
&nbsp;

I'll probably play Hey Hey 16K at least 5 or 10 times.

Between holidays, Red Hat Summit in SF, Red Hat Tech Exchange in Vietnam and a week of post-Vietnam illness, I only managed to get a few long runs in. D'wife also tripped whilst running, less than a week beforehand, and smashed her face up badly. But we had done the Clonakilty 10 Miler which we both felt went well. So we flew from Dublin the day before without too many nerves.

As soon as I set foot in the Expo to collect race numbers etc, the nerves started. Marathon number seven, the fourth one this year, but I felt like it was my first. The rest of the day was taken up with Checkpoint Charlie, the deeply moving Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and some of the worst service we've ever had [in a restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d7285098-Reviews-Vino_Basilico-Berlin.html).

The hotel was barely a 10 minute walk to the start line. The number of people at the start line was nuts. Just like London. The buzz we got when they showed the elites taking off was fantastic. I've said it a few times on Twitter already, but in what other sport can anyone take part in the same race as the fastest people in the world by just paying your few quid entrance fee? I hope this never changes as it makes long distance running something very special indeed.

![Start Line](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016-09-25%2017.18.52.jpg)

The course is dead flat, which is why the world record is broken here so often. Sadly I didn't break the record on this occasion. Maybe next time.

I loved the run. Despite the lack of prep and illness, I felt physically very strong the whole way around. I can't say the same thing about my brain which took 17 miles to settle down and STFU. The drinks stations were mental but they always arrived just as I needed them. And whoever is responsible for putting warm sweet tea at the drinks station needs to be paid a massive bonus.

The finish through Brandenburger Tor was one of those spine tingling moments. 

The German supporters were interesting. I found them a big help. There were lots of them (tho not at London levels) and they cheered lots. They also had music every mile or so which was fantastic, apart from the jazz obvs. But they don't shout your name like they do in London. In fact the only people who did shout were Brits and Aussies!

I got a Personal Best by only a few minutes (my Garmin data was garbage for some reason) and I felt pretty good within a few minutes of finishing, unlike Cork and Killarney where I was very wobbly.

Multiple pints and currywurst later and I was sorted. Thanks to Eoghan and Sabrina for that!

"""2023-05-22T12:00:00.000Z""",The Brooks Caldera 6 is an ultra-devouring monster (but),"UPDATE: See below for a major proviso to this post.

My entire history with Brooks until a few months ago was one pair of Adrenaline 19s which did not suit me at all. I always associated the brand with big reliable heavy running shoes for conservative joggers. The [Caldera 6](https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_ie/caldera-6-mens-distance-trail-running-shoe/110379.html) takes that reputation and shreds it, in the best possible sense.

![Caldera 6](/images/2023/05/caldera-6-mens-trail-running-shoe.png)

## The perfect shoe doesn't exist
I've been on the hunt for the ultimate ultra-distance trail running shoe since I started going longer in 2017. After a few false starts, I thought I'd found the perfect shoe in the Hoka Speedgoat 4. It was absolutely perfect for the Kerry Way Ultra Lite and all the training for the Kerry Way Ultra. The GTX version added too much weight but was superb for the nastier muckier stuff. Then they went and ruined things with the Speedgoat 5. It went from a completely locked-in shoe that felt part of your foot to this stretchy sloppy, albeit lighter, disappointment. Whilst it worked fine on the Kerry Way Ultra, I cinched the laces down so hard to stop slippage that I gave myself tendonitis. And whilst I loved the 4, there is no getting away from the fact that the much-lauded Vibram Megagrip is not very grippy at all on wet smooth stones.

So I was on a mission to find a replacement for the SG5. 

## Salomon Ultraglide
First stop was the Salomon Ultraglide. I'll do a full review soon but overall it's ""fine"". And definitely a major step backwards in grip.

## Saucony Xodus Ultra
Next up was the Saucony Xodus Ultra. Again full review soon but it was a disaster for me. The lugs are amazing on wet grass and mud. They are lethal on wet stones and rock. Worse than road shoes. And they have exactly the same problem as the Peregrines for me - horrendous heel pain due to an excessively narrow heel-counter. Which is weird since I adore the fit of the Endorphin series.

## New Balance Fresh Foam X More Trail v3
More recently, I tried the New Balance Fresh Foam X More Trail v3. This is an interesting shoe. Vibram Megagrip outsole with massive lugs. The giant slab of Fresh Foam X is incredibly comfortable and bouncy. On top of this is a roadshoe-like soft upper and 1970s Irish school-shoe laces. The NB is definitely on my short-list for the [Kerry Way Ultra](https://kerrywayultra.com/) and other less rough ultras where comfort is the key, now that I've bought proper laces. But they weren't great on a 5 mile rough loop around Coumshingaun in Waterford. The upper is far too sloppy with poor lockdown and the lugs had the same issue as the SG4/SG5 - fantastic on the mucky/wet stuff but slip-sliding on rocks. I split open my knee as a result. And a few weeks later, I fell again on some damp rocks.

## Caldera 6
And so on to the Caldera 6. They look like moonshoes, particularly in the Black/Yellow version I bought. First impressions were of a good fit/lockdown and decent bouncy midsole but not massively cushioned despite the height. The lugs aren't particularly deep. 

Some initial short trail runs showed that it could hold its own compared to all the others above on the mucky/grassy stuff. But it was when I went long and on lots of rocks that its true capabilities shone through.

The rubber in the Caldera 6 outsole is amazing on wet rocks, stones and slabs. I haven't had one slip. It grips like glue and gives massive confidence when running on mixed terrain. It transformed my experience of doing recces for the [Waterville Trail Running Festival](https://www.watervilletrailrunningfestival.com/).

And the midsole just seems perfectly tuned for ultra distances. Not too squishy and not too harsh, just right. So far I've done one 44km, one 88km and one 60km in the same pair and my feet were in perfect condition at the end of each. My forefoot was starting to ache after the 88km of the Waterville Trail Running Festival and the rough terrain of the [Beara Way Ultra](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/2259) was starting to cause hotspots at 60km, but that's it. 

The lockdown is better than it looks but very rough conditions will challenge it. As for stability, the overall footprint of the shoe is very wide. So despite the high stack, you don't feel unstable. I did roll my ankle a lot at WTF but I put that down to me, since it stopped as soon as I started watching my foot placement more. I had no rolls on the Beara Way.

![Dirty Caldera 6](/images/2023/05/dirty_caldera.png)

As I don't want a repeat of the SG4-SG5 disappointment, I've already bought a second pair of Calderas and put them aside. I suspect version 7 is coming soon since I just got a pair of v6 for €97 when the RRP is €150!

If you're tired of tip-toeing on wet rocks, this is the shoe you've been looking for.

# Update - Maybe not so perfect
Things had continued to go well with the Calderas and I did multiple shorter trail runs after the Ultras. Then two weeks ago, after 150 miles, whilst out again on the Beara Way, I realised my left foot was sliding around badly. I looked down to see a complete separation of the two parts of the upper. I really can't believe Brooks only used glue to hold two highly stressed sections together with no stitching at all. It was almost guaranteed to fail eventually. For this reason I have to withdraw my recommendation unless you only run on very gentle American buffed trails. I'll continue to use the Caldera 6 but only now that I have re-glued and awl-stitched the two parts together on both shoes. They happily survived a very tough 64km trail run last weekend after my repairs. Hopefully Brooks sees this post and my tweet and fixes the problem for the Caldera 7. (No response on Twitter after a week. What is going on with major brands and the complete collapse of their customer support/interaction quality?)

"""2017-07-23T20:00:00+01:00""",The Chiltern Challenge 50k - Conor's First Ultra Marathon,"I made this comment on Twitter last week:

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Any chance we can narrow &quot;inspirational&quot; to mean &quot;inspired me to action&quot; instead of &quot;isn&#39;t that a nice story&quot;?</p>&mdash; Conor O&#39;Neill (@conoro) <a href=""https://twitter.com/conoro/status/887569059612676096"">July 19, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>

It was partially driven by the silly overuse of ""inspirational"" but also by the fact that I was inspired to run 50km last weekend by all of the amazing Ultrarunners in the US and Europe and the stories they tell via YouTube, Vimeo, Blogs, Twitter, Instagram, magazines and books.

The attraction of Ultras for me is both the off-road nature of them, with often breathtaking views, and the idea of pushing myself further. Whilst I'll continue to work on my weight and improve my awful slow road marathon times, I also want to just go further for longer.

Back to the inspirational thing again. At the MCI Ballina marathon in March, a woman got her award for 50 marathons. She had wanted to do 50 before 50. Her 25th had only been in the previous September! That got me thinking and I decided I wanted to do 50 before 50 too, but in my case, 50 miles. I have 10 months left to do it.

So what do you do before 50 miles? Why 50k natürlich.

Doing a 50k in Ireland turns out not to be easy. Most of the IMRA stuff is either very short or is hardcore open mountain which I just don't have the skills for yet. So I looked to the UK and discovered they have a *lot* of doable ones.

The one that really caught my eye was the [Chiltern Challenge](http://www.xnrg.co.uk/events/details/chiltern-challenge-ultra2017.aspx). They call it an ideal first Ultra and it had the added benefit of being near London. We came up with a cunning plan to spend a few days in Center Parcs in Woburn Forest with the kids and I'd disappear on the Saturday to do the race.

I didn't really do any specific training for it apart from doing more forest stuff. It's damned hard to do ""single track"" style trail running over any sort of distance here without resorting to mind-numbing loops. So those short runs plus 3 road marathons and 2 halves from Jan-July would have to suffice.

I had most of my kit sorted well ahead of time. Cheap Kalenji Hydration pack, cheap Leki poles, Altra Lone Peak 3.0 runners, usual marathon top etc. I got the right OS Map from the UK and drew out the entire course on it. Hmm, some very close contour lines in places.

![Map](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chiltern_map.jpg)

Then I started reading the race reviews more closely and they all mentioned the stifling heat last year.

And the panic set in.

The one thing that destroys me in races is heat, presumably due to my weight. I've had dog slow times in Cork twice and Berlin due to it. OK, I got a PB in blazing hot Brighton but was seriously head-fucked afterwards.

So I ordered 2x larger Salomon soft flasks in addition to the water bladder. I watched the temperature predictions like a hawk for two weeks. The closer the day got, the higher it went. 26C was the highest I saw mentioned. I stocked up on electrolytes for the bottles and had all my GUs ready too.

I read more reviews and sub-4-hr marathoners were talking about taking 8hrs. Even more panic. Could I end up running in the dark?

Then I started worrying about the pain in my right foot that had been there for a few weeks. The Lone Peaks don't have huge cushion. So I panic bought a pair of Hoka One One Cliftons despite being worried about their narrowness and size. Three off-road runs convinced me that they were a great choice. As long as it didn't rain too much.

The trip to Center Parcs was hassle-free but I was more tense than I've ever been before a run. I decided to read Cory Reese's book that night, [Nowhere Near First: Ultramarathon Adventures From The Back Of The Pack](https://www.amazon.com/Nowhere-Near-First-Ultramarathon-Adventures-ebook/dp/B01KW37P5M/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) as recommended by Sarah Lavender Smith in her book, [The Trail Runner's Companion](https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Runners-Companion-Step-Step-ebook/dp/B071WDHGCW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1500834677&sr=1-1&keywords=the+trail+runners+companion) (review coming shortly). I am so glad I did. After the initial shock of what he had to deal with as a kid, this is a truly uplifting, funny and, dare I say it again, inspirational, book. I went to bed feeling a lot better about the run and actually slept ok.

The usual insanity of a Google Maps back-road route got me to Princes Risborough school with tons of time to spare. There were a lot more people than I was expecting. We were the non-elite 9am group. The walkers started at 8am and the elites would hunt us down like prey starting at 10am. Weather predictions still varied wildly but so far it was dull and drizzly so I was a very happy camper.

The RD gave a great pep talk and really settled my nerves. His show-of-hands proved that there were a lot of first-timers with me, which also helped.

![Start line](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2008.46.05.jpg)

And with zero fanfare, off we went.

I kept the poles strapped to the hydration pack for later but actually never used them. There was probably only two places where they would have been very useful.

The 70+ yo woman passed me pretty quickly. I'm not bitter :-) She was fast!

People started walking very early which was frustrating as it hadn't got hilly yet and it was almost single-track. But then we quickly got to an extremely steep piece with wooden steps and had a queue at the top to get through the stile.

Despite all the RD warnings, people went off-course almost immediately. But they were called back in each case. It turned out that my paper map, compass, OS Maps on Android, paper map photos, Open Street Maps, route on my Garmin watch and Offline Google Maps were not just overkill, they were completely unnecessary. Between the signs, painted arrows on the ground and the knotted tape, there was only one spot in the entire 50k where I was unsure where to go because some arsehole had torn down an arrow (we could see the zip-ties).

I'm not going to do a mile by mile account, don't worry.

![Field](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2010.38.11.jpg)

The route was everything I had hoped for and nothing I had feared. A couple of steep sections but the rest of it was rolling hills. Most of it was forest.

![Forest](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2015.04.51.jpg)

But there were also some lovely tracks through fields of wheat (a la Theresa May):

![Wheat](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2014.58.13.jpg)

Also fields of corn, peas and beans.

![Corn](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2012.19.07.jpg)

I did exactly as planned and ran the downhills/flats and walked the uphills. I had one aim and that was to finish, no matter how long it took. The downside of this is that I got lazy pretty early. My legs were not having a good day and felt leaden throughout. So any sort of incline had me walking.

As with road marathons, I stuck mostly to myself. For whatever reason, I'm not chatty when I'm running. I'm probably just stuck in my head. I'll talk to anyone who talks to me but I don't start many chats on runs. It was the same on Saturday. I tended to end up running near people but rarely with them.

There were 4 check-points, all of which had drinks, food and very very friendly volunteers. Each one gave me a huge boost and I was in no hurry to leave any of them.

Obviously this is not a race with crowds of supporters but there were a couple of places where people gave me a big cheer and it was bloody wonderful.

As the day progressed, I was in top mental form. The best ever in a race. I was loving every minute of it and had no issues apart from a pain that was growing in my left calf and two squished bloody little toes.

![Another field](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2015.31.41.jpg)

I had long chats in my head about the amazing [Public Rights of Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_way_in_England_and_Wales) and [Freedom to Roam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam) rules in the UK. The areas where I was running has a maze of routes, paths and tracks over private land. The gates and stiles worked well and I saw no rubbish anywhere. Meanwhile in Ireland, we're still living in some sort of John B Keane play.

There were lots of pre-warnings about briars and nettles so I had also done an emergency purchase of cheap Kalenji leg sleeves in the week before. They worked brilliantly for the nettles apart from the head-height ones.

![Nettles](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2014.48.41.jpg)

The sleeves also seemed to help a lot with the left calf pain.

There was a stretch of a couple of miles on a road which I hated. Not only was it incredibly steep in places, I also had to deal with cars. This was by far my slowest segment. All of the others were within minutes of each other.

I couldn't believe it when I got to marathon distance and I was feeling great!

The comedy highlight was me thinking someone was shouting encouragement to me from across a field. Then I realised it was a sheep.

About 5km from the end I caught up with a group of 4 young people and had a bit of a natter. They were n00bs too and some of them were struggling. I walked for a bit with them but when they said they were going to walk all the rest, I decided to move on.

I got to a brilliant steep downhill section and bombed it, which was possibly not the most sensible thing to do near the end but it was fun. Then a run across a big field, a tiny bit more walking and OMG, there's the school. I ran into the playground, got a big cheer and crossed the finish line feeling like a million dollars.

I bloody did it. And I didn't hurt too much. And if I had to go further to go, I'd have been ok with that.

![Finish Line](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2016.52.11-1.jpg)

I got some pics taken and had a magical cup of tea.

Then into the car and back to Woburn with a smile on my face which would not go away.

I was over the moon to see my brilliant wife and 15yo standing at the entrance to the giant Center Parcs car park. They took the car off me so I could wander over to the holiday home and find the best-damned-tasting curry and beer in years waiting for me.

![Medal](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-16%2009.00.51.jpg)

In the week since, I've been thinking about it a lot. I really did love almost every minute. I am immensely proud of myself despite the extremely slow time. And now I want to do more. Soon. And push myself harder and see what this old body can do.

As for the [Chiltern Challenge](http://www.xnrg.co.uk/events/details/chiltern-challenge-ultra2017.aspx) itself, I have only good things to say about it and the organisers. They are absolutely correct in saying it's a perfect first Ultra. Anyone who has run a road marathon is more than capable of doing a good time. Apart from the odd tree-root and nettle, it's not remotely technical.

Go on, give it a go.

Oh, you're wondering about my time eh?

Check out this for consistency :-)

"""2018-03-12T06:49:50+00:00""",The fatally flawed Salomon Sense Pro Max,"I read some reviews of the [Sense Pro Max](https://www.salomon.com/uk/product/sense-pro-max.html) last year and they looked like a good pair of mixed surface running shoes. However they came with the usual Salomon price tag and I didn't have a specific need for them.

Fast-forward to January this year and I started getting worried about the footwear I was going to use in my first 50 Miler, the [Liverpool to Manchester Ultra](http://www.gbultras.com/liverpool-to-manchester-ultra/). Then I spotted that the Salomons were half price on Wiggle. €73 was an absolute steal so I immediately ordered them. The mix of very high stack plus that grippy sole seemed to be the perfect combo for LIVMAN.

Initial signs were good apart from the speedlace mechanism being very stiff on one side.

I did a few 8-10 mile mixed road/trail runs which seemed ok. I'd been having some achilles problems due to the mileage increase so I didn't pay much attention to the fact that my knees werea little bit sore after each run.

![Sense Pro Max](/images/2018/03/salomon_sense_pro_max.jpg)

This past Saturday we headed up West to do a small local Marathon. This would be the final test of the shoes to decide if I'd use them for LIVMAN.

The first flaw kicked in after a mile - a relentless loud squeak from the left shoe on every footstep. Yup, 26 miles and 5+ hours of squeak squeak squeak. The same thing was mentioned in [the review on Ultrarunner Podcast](https://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/salomon-sense-pro-max-review/). So it's clearly not a one-off, there is a sole design problem.

As the miles added up, I noticed a pain on the outside of both knees increasing. By mile 16 or so, it was very sore. Then I discovered it was worse when I walked. And then I discovered that it was excruciating when going from walk to run. Every drink stop from then on was torture.

I finished with both knees in agony. The left side seized as I walked away from the finish. Luckily I had voltarol gel in my bag but I had to jog back to the hotel because I couldn't walk. 2 days later and the pain is still there, albeit much reduced (yay voltarol).

I've run in a ton of different shoes - Asics, VFFs, Hokas, Altras, Skechers and Inov-8s. None of them have ever caused anything like this. And again, this isn't unique to me. [Running Shoes Guru](https://www.runningshoesguru.com/2017/11/salomon-sense-pro-max-review/) had _exactly_ the same problem. There appears to be a fundamental design flaw in these shoes. I don't know what it is, but you really need to avoid them. The fact that they are half-price after less than a year on the market hints that Salomon are either going to cancel them or replace them soon.

On a positive note, I also got the [Salomon Advanced Skin 5](https://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/salomon-advanced-skin-5-set/) hydration vest for LIVMAN and it's superb. I ran the Lusk marathon with it as a test and it worked brilliantly. The only glitch, as mentioned in reviews, is that it's difficult to get the soft flasks back into the vest when it's on. Not exactly a deal-breaker."
"""2023-06-08T06:00:00.000Z""",The Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar - A great watch with one infuriating design flaw,"After a couple of great years with the Forerunner 935, the ever-reducing battery life started to become annoying and I decided last summer to upgrade to the 955 Solar.

![955 Solar](/images/2023/06/955solar.jpg)

Overall I like the feature-set and it generally feels like a solid upgrade to the 935. I particularly love the maps navigation. Being able to load up a course like the Beara Way Ultra and follow it via glances, along with some buzzes and beeps for major turns and going off-course, is an amazing time and hassle saver. I haven't gone off-course or gotten lost once since I started using it. 

But there is one infuriating thing, the damned buttons. Initially the mechanism just felt cheap and stiff. I bought a lot of $15-$30 watches from Aliexpress in 2019 for a work project and most of them had better button feel. But on the 955 they then started sticking and double-clicking. Remember this is a watch that cost €650! 

I sent it back to the store and they had to wait 6 weeks for a replacement to arrive.

There was the same stiffness in the buttons of the replacement initially and then, you've got to be kidding me, they started sticking again.

I put up with it for months despite it driving me nuts, as I didn't want to wait another 6 weeks for a replacement. Every time I pressed the crappy light button and it came half way out, paused and then came fully out, I thought ""I paid €650 for this rubbish"".

Last week the annoyance got too much and I opened a support ticket directly with Garmin. I pointed out that it's clearly a design flaw with the watch and plenty of people are complaining about it online. I asked if I could trade it in for a different model and I would pay the difference. The 2 day response time was 6 days: No possibility of a trade-in and they are only offering a pre-owned watch in replacement. Presumably I'll get one of the thousands that have been returned due to having sticking buttons

That's Garmin's idea of customer service? A used watch for something still under warranty? A used watch that will almost definitely have the same problem as the other two?

Garmin feels a bit like mid-90s Nokia at the moment. Releasing a crazy number of devices for every demographic and clearly not putting the effort in to design or manufacture them well. Apple ate Nokia's lunch and I suspect Apple + Coros will eat Garmin's. Their one big defence is their existing customer base. But if offering a used watch to a loyal customer who has bought 5 watches and an InReach is how they want to do customer retention, they are in for a nasty surprise over the next couple of years."
"""2023-06-04T06:00:00.000Z""",The inaugural Beara Way Ultra - Don't bring a knife to a gunfight,"## Guaranteed finish
I'm pretty sure the great Hal Higdon's training plan for an ultra would be:

* Do minimal daily sessions
* Do one long slow amble a week
* Skip core and glute exercises for a month
* Don't get that long-term hamstring issue sorted out
* DNF after 88K of [a different ultra](https://www.watervilletrailrunningfestival.com/130km-ultra) three weeks prior
* Don't sleep for the week beforehand

Setup for success like this, I headed to Castletownbere at 3am from Bandon to try the first ever [Beara Way Ultra](https://www.imra.ie/events/details/id/2259/).

![Indy](/images/2023/06/Indy_Sword_Gun_Text2.gif)

## To do the Beara you must first understand the Beara. Or something.
For the [Kerry Way Ultra](https://kerrywayultra.com/) I had reccied every inch of the course. For Beara, I had done Glengarriff to Adrigole and Adrigole to Castletownbere a few years previously. I also did the Castletownbere/Allihies loop this year. 

Oh and how could I forget the world's shortest recce in January. I parked outside Kenmare and tried to run back towards Lauragh. Within minutes I was wading through ice-cold water in completely useless small-lugged Salomons. After 2 miles I called it a day and slid all the way back. The water was so cold, the midsoles of the running shoes went rock hard. I may have damaged the road back to the car.

So in summary, I was heading to Beara terrified. The huge section from Eyeries to Glengarriff was a complete unknown to me and the elevation profile looked horrendous.

## The first Western States 100 had 14 entries
I was surprised that fewer than 40 people had signed up despite lots of excitement about it. Even tho I was completely unprepared and still smarting from my [WTF DNF/Time-Out](https://conoroneill.com/2023/05/22/having-a-wtf-moment-at-the-waterville-trail-running-festival/), I couldn't miss the chance to run the first ever instance of a race that I'm convinced is going to be famous. 

As I walked from the car up to the school start line, everything started hurting. Because of course it does. The two rules of start lines - you absolutely have to go to the toilet right now and every niggle you've ever had in you life says ""hello, remember me?""

I got setup with a tracker and laid out my ridiculously overstocked drop bags. This was followed by 15 minutes of staring out to sea trying to calm myself down and finding myself incapable of stringing a sentence together.

![Start Line](/images/2023/06/utb1.jpg)

## Like a bullet train
The race started incredibly well as I immediately went into last place.

A couple of road miles were followed by some lumpy bits and then mixed terrain all the way to Allihies. Whilst this all went fine, the heat was building and the niggles didn't settle.

The stretch after Allihies along the coast is jaw-dropping. Just go. It was also where the wheels started coming off for me. My stomach started churning, the heat got worse and suddenly I was incredibly tired after what was barely a training run. 

![Start Line](/images/2023/06/utb2.jpg)

## You're going the wrong way. No I'm just slow.
The grind out towards Dursey was brutal for me but two things made it easier. The first was meeting the front-runners on the way back and their words of encouragement. The second was Crow Head. I had a Grand Canyon moment there. Anyone who was been there knows the Grand Canyon feeling - your brain can't absorb it. It's so epic, it actually looks like a painting. The way the water flowed around the rocks on Crow Head did that to me. I purposely didn't take a picture or video because I knew I couldn't do it justice.

There's one ""trip and it's the bottom of the Atlantic for you matey"" section around there but otherwise it's a continuation of never-ending ups and downs.

![Start Line](/images/2023/06/utb3.jpg)

## What's this core training y'all keep talking about?
About 10 miles in, I had two horrible realisations - [1] I hadn't recovered at all from WTF and was already exhausted and [2] My core and quads were both also trashed from WTF and even running downhill hurt like hell.

By the time I got to the Dursey cable car (and yay it'll be back in action next week!) I was out of water, overheated and struggling badly. But the water-station crew did a brilliant job of boosting me. And like so many lovely aid station people, they lied through their teeth - ""Oh ya, there's several people behind you"". Sure sure. I know I'm last.

Weirdly I started catching someone. And I realised he was wearing a rain-jacket. Zipped up. What the actual fuck? I'll tell you more about [Adolfo Garcia](https://www.strava.com/athletes/16739862) in a bit.

## Luxury
He and I toed and froed for a few miles and ended up back in Allihies almost together. I had to get some fizzy drinks in the shop and then just topped up my water and grabbed some food from my drop bag. I stopped at the incredible copper mines to eat some of it. At which point I realised I couldn't eat. Every mouthful made me want to vomit. But compared to the men, women and children who dug into these hills to mine copper 200 years ago, I was having a grand old time.

Adolofo stopped to explain that he had busted his ankle after 10km and was in a lot of pain. Most people would have quit but he kept on going.

The guys back in Allihies concurred with me that I had no hope of making the 11 hour cut-off in Eyeries but I pushed a bit anyway. The ups killed me and the downs weren't much better. At least I was well hydrated now but all food/gels made me nauseous. At this stage Adolfo seemed to have fallen quite far back and I couldn't see him.

## Ayeries? Eeeeeries? Aries?
Eventually I ambled into Eyeries assuming I was over time. But nooooooo, I had 50 seconds left to grab my next drop bag and leave.

![Start Line](/images/2023/06/utb4.jpg)

I'm sure tougher people than me would have taken the bag and headed off, but I had nothing left at that stage. Legs and core were bollixed and my stomach was in bits. 

Third Ultra DNF in a row then.

The team at the aid station took care of me extremely well as I sat and waited for Adolfo, who was now well over time. I tried nibbling on various bits in my drop bag but all had the same effect, instant nausea. Weirdly the cup of coffee I was given went down fine.

## Some like it hot
Adolfo arrived and we had a fantastic chat. I finally got to the bottom of his zipped up rain jacket on a scorching hot day - he was heat training for [Lavaredo Ultra Trail](https://lavaredo.utmb.world/) in a month's time. That's a very very smart move by him.

The brilliant aid team drove us back to the start and that was the end of my day on the Beara.

## Everyone else
Of the 38 starters, 24 finished. Stephen Mangan ran an amazing race to win and Lianne van Dijk demolished the course to come second overall. A ton of really great runners also DNFed but mostly in places like Lauragh and Glengarriff. Messed up stomachs and trench foot seemed to be the two most common complaints.

## The eternal DNFer question
Should I have DNFed? I wondered for a week and then curiosity got the better of me - so I did an Eyeries-Ardgroom out-and-back a week later and an Ardgroom-Lauragh out-and-back a week after that. Whilst those two sections were a *lot* easier than I expected, I realised I had no hope of going beyond Ardgroom on race day. 

So it was the right call to quit but I don't regret giving it a go for 60km. The race is going to grow and grow as people learn about it and I'm just so happy to have been part of the first outing, even for such a short period of time.

The main thing I've learned in the past two scorching hot weeks is that I chronically under-hydrate. And I think that's what gets me into trouble (ditto Connemarathon and Cork City last year). I drank double the amount on those post-recces as I did in the race and I had no issues at all, despite both days being hotter. So I'm going to have to learn to like carrying a water bladder.

UPDATE: After feeling rubbish for quite a while, I went to the Doctor 3 weeks after Beara and got a set of blood tests. The results are in - I have a low ferritin level of 22. I think that explains why I've been struggling in these recent races with wooziness etc. Despite eating a very iron-rich vegan diet, I suspect my 15+ year use of omeprazole has finally bitten me in the ass. Let's see if things improve over the summer with iron supplements and cold-tofurkey on the acid reflux!

## Thank Yous
The logistics of such a long race are extremely difficult, particularly with the terrain and the remoteness of much of the Beara. I take my bucket hat off to the RDs Michael McSweeney, Robbie Williams and Carol Hurley. This is the beginning of something very special. 

To all the volunteers, IMRA members and Beara AC folks - thank you thank you. I wouldn't have made it past the cable car without you all. And I know you all went above and beyond for those who were out for 34hrs+.

And like all these ultras in Ireland, it just can't happen without the fantastic landowners. 

## 2024 yeah?
Of bloody course I am. I've already started training for it. Ok ok, it's for the Kerry Way Ultra but I'm already doing a lot more elevation and miles only two weeks later. My main things to focus on are getting comfortable with the non-stop ups and downs and dealing with the boggier stuff between Lauragh and Glengarriff. 

## Women are tougher than men
Three women started the Beara Way Ultra 2023. Three women finished. As any man who has stood in a delivery ward can confirm, women kick our asses when it comes to toughness.  

But we have to do something about the cultural thing where overly-confident incompetent men (like yours truly) will enter a 100 miler completely unprepared whilst hundreds of women around the country, who are more than capable of finishing, don't take part.

Oh, by the way, you want to see grit? Then watch the film about [Sally McRae's Cocodona 250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIkGsxCp-14). I grimaced the entire way.

## Should *you* try it?
I think anyone who has done other hilly ultras in Cork, Kerry and Wicklow would be able to at least give it a good go. Strangely, I don't think a KWU finish would automatically mean you can deal with Beara. It's 20 miles shorter but the relentless elevation change and huge amount of bog is very different to Iveragh. I have to assume anyone who does alpine ultras or did the UTS 100 recently could handle it ok. 

So it's not like I said about Waterville where anyone who has done a marathon could give it a lash. It's a different beast and that's what's so wonderful about it. 

Some day, I'd love to see an ultra series - Sheep's Head Way, Beara Way, Kerry Way and Dingle Way. Maybe when they finally create a Mizen Way, we could have one there too. How epic would that be!"
"""2018-09-02T18:26:02.859Z""","The Kerry Ultra 50K - Go on, sign-up for 2019","[The Kerry Ultra 50K](https://kerryultra.com/) was somehow not on my radar but luckily my wife spotted it recently. We decided to do it barely a week beforehand.

  

Unlike a lot of ultras over in the UK, this one was all on-road and mostly self-supported. There was a small table every 10K with water and Redbull only.

  

We went down to Tralee the night before to make the race briefing. Brian O'Shea went into huge detail on both the 50K and 100K which weirdly made me more stressed than if I'd known nothing.

  

The 16 people who did the 100K headed off at 6am whereas we had a nice relaxing lie-in and breakfast in the Ashe Hotel. 31 of us lined up at 10am amid lots of good humour and photos. After another pep talk from Brian, off we went.

  

As always, you'll get no mile by mile summary from me. Basically I had a bad day. Lots of stuff hurt after a few miles and I was hot and slightly out of sorts almost from the start. But I plugged away at the back of the field and took in the fabulous views over Tralee Bay.

  

I've come tothe conclusion recently that I don't really like long road races and much prefer the trails. My wife is the opposite. She had a good day and powered away from me early. 

  

A very long pit-stop involving a 99 cone and Club Orange in the lovely Fenit totally re-energised me even if it took forever. Fun fact - Saint Brendan The Explorer is from Fenit and that is one impressive statue of him.

  

The Blennerville windmill looked as good as ever and then I hit the worst part of the route. A couple of miles of back roads to make up the 50K instead of the lovely walkway beside the river.

  

I kept my head down and was never so happy to see the Aquadome in Tralee. The nicest cup of tea of all time awaited me at the finish line. 

  

I was thrilled that my wife finished her first ultra after the disappointment of Liverpool to Manchester. We hung around for a short while and cheered in a few more people. But I was feeling very ropey from the heat and we hit the road back to Bandon shortly afterwards.

  

Apart from probably not drinking enough fluids, I was in a good state overall later and recovered quickly over the next few days.

  

I'd love to see more people doing this race. Honestly, if you've ever done even one marathon, you'll do this no bother. Don't be put off by the ""self-supported"" aspect. Just get a cheap hydration vest in Decathlon or Wiggle, stick in a few bottles of water, some Tailwind and a few gels/sweets and you'll be fine. The course was extremely well marked (I had Viewranger for backup) and Vincent Guthrie from MCI and the Tullaroan Marathon was checking in on people with his van in the early sections to make sure all was well.

  

Apart from a couple of sections, I felt quite safe with the traffic. The tight road leaving Ardfert and some of the bits after Blennerville did feel a bit dodgy with totally blind bends. But there are huge parts of it that are very quiet or very straight. And those views, seriously!

  

Great job by the organisers. And I'll say it again, you should think about doing it next year. Wouldn't you like to be able to tell people you're an ultrarunner :-)"

## Some Day

I had been vaguely aware of the [Kerry Way Ultra](http://www.kerrywayultra.com/) for quite a few years and I even heard an elite US ultra runner list it as their top bucket list race on a podcast. But it was so far out of reach for me as to be almost mythical. Then I heard about the Lite edition and thought ""some day some day"".

But 18 months of Covid, getting that bit older, losing a ton of weight and loving the Killorglin 12-12 snapped me out of that wishful thinking nonsense and made me sign up. In fact that whole carpe diem thing has become a major driving force for me in 2021.

Between some earlier 2019 hikes/walks and a bunch of recces this year, I had covered most of the route, apart from a few miles around Templenoe and a few out beyond Torc. So I was going into it with a good understanding of the terrain and elevation. 

I'd been suffering non-stop issues with my hips, right leg, sciatic nerve and general ""below the waist"" nonsense for 2 years which only got worse after my fall on the [Sheep's Head Way FKT](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/) in May. But some simple exercises from a physio focused on my glutes along with a hairdressers ""jockey chair"" for my tech job solved 90% of it over July and August. 

Between the recces and the exercises, I was feeling very positive heading towards September, despite not having a proper training plan and not doing a lot of mileage at all. But it was still a huge prospect for me to try and do it well and hope it was neither scorching hot nor a quagmire.

## Today

I packed for every eventuality including earthquake, typhoon, moon crashing into the earth and rain, but woke up to a perfect slightly cool morning in Killarney. 

Top tip for vegans/veggies, the [Brehon Hotel](https://www.thebrehon.com/) has entire menus just for you. Unfortunately we were too early for the brekkie so the brilliant [Flahavans Overnight Oats](https://www.flahavans.ie/product/flahavans-cranberry-chia-seeds-overnight-oats/) with a banana did the trick. My pack wasn't toooo crazy once I'd calmed down. 

![Gear](/images/2021/10/gear.jpg)


My Crew-Wife, as I christened Catherine, drove myself and her former teammate John from Laz Lake's [Circumpolar Race Around the World](https://www.craw.racing/) to Sneem. I had the same immediate feeling I'd had in Chamonix on our family summer holiday in 2019 - I have found my people. To see a tiny village buzzing with energy, excitement and people at such an early hour was just magical. I immediately had to go for a wee with the nervous giddiness.

![Sneem](/images/2021/10/sneem.jpg)


As we passed mandatory gearcheck, John said ""you know who that was checking your bag? Aoife Mundow!"". ""Holy crap, no way"". ""Will we go get a photo with her?"" ""Hell yes"". 

Cue photo of the very embarassed bad-ass Aoife with two grinning auld fellas.

![Aoife Mundow](/images/2021/10/aoife.jpg)


Now go listen to the mind-boggling [Inspirational Runner Podcast](https://theinspirationalrunner.podbean.com/e/podcast-103-aoife-mundow-the-pursuit-of-personal-limits-24hr-irish-track-record-holder-kerry-way-ultra-winner/) interview with her and hear the story of someone going from average road runner to one of the best ultra runners in Europe in the space of two years.

##  Goooooooooooooo
I found myself getting a bit emotional every time someone from the Full passed through the village as we waited for the start of the Lite. Then, suddenly, it was time. Oh sheeeeeeeeeeeeet, here we go. 

As long time readers of this blog will know, I do not write those mile by mile race reports that are very common. I'm more about the highlights and lowlights and hopefully some useful tips if you are thinking of doing the race yourself. 

The first 7 miles were a doddle. Paths, lanes, roads, old tracks. Nothing remotely rough and it was absolutely ideal underfoot due to the recent good weather. There are some wooden walkways in those places that tend to get very boggy along the entire course. It was slow tho as it's quite narrow for a few miles and you can end up stuck behind slower runners. I can't believe I'm writing those words as I'm usually that soldier.

I was having a wonderful start but then, oh jesus christ, we started encountering the walking dead. The poor bastards who were doing the Full and were completely broken. They weren't just walking, they were inching forward. I can't imagine how hard it must have been for them to have 200 people rush past them, each one telling them they were doing great. My respect for each of you in that pain-cave is endless. If you finished it, with 50-odd km to go, in that state, then you are a proper legend.

As for the Lite, once that first easy bit is done, you get into some hilly, rockier stuff for a few miles but it's nothing too bad. You might use poles there if you have them. I'd strongly recommend them in general if only for the hill out of Kenmare and for some help in the latter miles.

## Dem views
There's an absolutely gorgeous section after Blackwater Bridge along the water in the woods. It's one of my favourite parts of the whole course. I was now on that one big chunk I'd never reccied including a short jog on the main road to Templenoe. I hadn't arranged any support stop with Catherine here but I wish I had. I didn't actually need anything but seeing all the support crews and everyone getting stocked-up and boosted-up hit me really hard mentally. Particularly since the next couple of miles were all uphill on roads and I found them extremely hard. But then, just as my misery was at a peak, so was the road, and bam, downhill blast for a couple of joyful miles. I was back baby.

The next off-road section is all the way into Kenmare and is the worst from a terrain point of view. It's also manky boggy in places when it has been raining (Feb-Jan in Ireland), which luckily it wasn't on the day. But there's lots of pretty steep rough ground and I had two near face-plants as I stumbled due to the legs getting a bit tired.

![Vista](/images/2021/10/vista.jpg)

## Kenmare
You then have another lovely downhill into Kenmare with lots of people out and about and tons of support crews. Practical note - there's free public loos right in the centre just at the carpark if you need them.

I met Catherine at the far side of the town opposite Supervalu. Most of the other crews were in a carpark in the centre of town, which might have been better for me for an emotional boost. But in reality I was fine and Catherine's energy got me buzzing again.

I stripped down the excessive clothes, lost a bunch of crap from my pack, refilled my water/Zero/Tailwind, stuffed my face with crisps and full-fat coke, and headed off after a pretty short stop. I braced myself for the next three miles.

## Bastard Hill
I don't know about anyone else, but those 3 miles out of Kenmare and into the old Kenmare Road are the toughest of the lot. That damned hill out of the town is hard to drive up, let alone walk/jog. And when you finally do all the ups and downs, then you have the Old Kenmare Road trail itself which is also incredibly steep at the start.

Whilst I hated that hill, it made me finally realise something - I was killing it on the uphills. There were lots of people who flew past me on the downs and the flats, but I caught them every single time on the ups. I'm convinced that was due to the physio exercises and really focusing on not being bent-over going uphill. I drove everything through my glutes and the poles. For once I managed to protect my hip flexors. Hell, I even had zero quad or hamstring pain during or after the race. 

Now when I say ""killing it"", I mean walking quickly, not running. Or power-hiking as Ryan Ploeckelman calls it. But it was way faster than many people who were easily half my age. One poor guy in his twenties kept racing past me at high speed and then would stop suddenly and start stretching. I finally asked him what was going on. His hamstrings were trashed. I'm guessing he was far too agressive earlier in the race. The slowness of old age has its advantages sometimes.

## The New Hotness
Whilst I was having a phenomenal day leg-wise, the same was not true of my stomach or head. I was really feeling the heat and every time I ate, I got pukey. At times I felt light-headed too. I originally thought it was down to overdressing for cooler weather earlier but it was still happening after the gear change. Worse, every time I tried to run at any sort of decent pace, my heart rate went through the roof.

I came up with a theory that it was related to my massive weight loss in 2020/2021. I imagined that the temperature PID Controller (for Engineering nerds) in my body had been tuned over twenty years of obesity for a much bigger mass. So when it now had to deal with a very light mass, it overshot in both directions making me either too hot or too cold. I had terrible problems last winter where any hint of coldness would spiral out of control and leave me shivering completely out of proportion (P in PID) to the actual room temperature. 

After doing Ecotrail Wicklow 46km three weeks later in similar heat, I'm now thinking it was more to do with lack of fluids. I had the same problem in Wicklow but I got it under control by drinking lots of fluids in the latter half of the race. I really didn't drink enough at all in Kerry.

## The Old Kenmare Road
If you haven't run or hiked the Old Kenmare road, you should. It's just lovely and dead easy. There's only a few tiny short rocky bits. I'm convinced I have met more Germans on it in the past two years than Irish people. Maybe everyone thinks it's a road? It isn't. I assume it was one at some stage? Famine times? I tried to imagine edging forward on the lumpy ground in a pony and trap from Kenmare to Killarney 150 years ago. Not fun.

![Conor Downhill](/images/2021/10/conor_kwu_lite_2.jpg)

So that whole segment along Old Kenmare heading towards Torc is up and down and up and down but it's not hard. You'll be tired but the scenery will make up for it. On the downside, you'll keep thinking you're about to get to the waterfall ""any minute now"" but it never seems to arrive.

## Romance Guru
There are some small stream crossings on the Old Kenmare Road which other runners were taking full advantage of to cool down. I finally did so when I reached quite a large stream with a bridge. I'd brought a [Katadyn BeFree 1L Filter softflask](https://www.bergfreunde.eu/katadyn-befree-filter-1l-water-filter/) as a backup to my two Salomon 500ml flasks and filled it twice. Once to spray all over myself and once to drink. Some heat exhaustion may have gone to my head because I filled it for a third time and put it in my pack as I thought Catherine would really like some lovely Kerry Mountain Water. After a mile of sloshing and regaining some sanity, I emptied it. She confirmed later that she did not in fact have any interest in Kerry Mountain Water. Even filtered.

## Yes. No. Uh-huh. Nope. Oh. Wow. Yep. Really?
The big change with encountering the Full runners now was how much better condition they were in. Some of them were really moving strongly. All seemed chipper and chatty. Not that I chat much in races. Sorry to anyone who thinks I'm a grumpy unfriendly fucker in races. If you talk to me, I'll happily chat back. But basically all the blood leaves my brain and I find it impossible to form even vaguely intelligent sentences. So I rarely initiate.

## Cue The Stone Roses
Fiiiiiiiinally I reached the first waterfall upper carpark and nearly missed the turn. It's weird how the worst signage for the Kerry Way is from Torc to Killarney itself. And it's even worse in the main park. Ye know, where all the tourists are. It's way too easy to go astray around there but there'll be tons of people around so just ask one.

I trotted down the track and the rocky steps to the waterfall. Nearly face-planted again as I missed a step. Under the road I went and into the main park beside the lakes.


## Afternoon Tea in Muckross with Mark Labbett
I now only had 4ish miles to go but fuck me they are the longest four miles in the universe. There were tourists and Jarveys everywhere. I was exhausted. I tried running but it was just start/stop, start/stop. And then something lovely happened.

Another runner came trotting past and said ""Howya. I just wanted to say thanks. I've been chasing you for hours but I could never quite catch you. And I finally have. Thanks for being my motivation today, it was a huge help"". Maybe some people would be bothered by that but I was thrilled. I replied ""I know exactly what you mean. I was doing the same to two young guys for ages. I finally left them two miles back"".

After three centuries, I made it out of the park. And sure then it's just a few hundred yards to the finish. Hah, just kidding, it's another century and a half. I picked up the pace a bit. Come on you old fart, run. Run you old fucker. And I did. I saw Randall's Garage and the crowd and I almost lost it completely.

## I'm Not Crying You're Crying
![Finish](/images/2021/10/finish.jpg)

I turned the corner into the world's most wonderfully low-key finish line and my wife. I was handed a lovely wooden fridge-magnet medal and free wheel alignment by the force of nature that is Eileen Daly. 

![Medal](/images/2021/10/medal.jpg)


And then the tears came. 

But they didn't last long as we had to deal with John puking and looking very bad. The ambulance sorted him out. 

I sat on the ground, took off my Hokas and just revelled in what I had done. Maybe I looked rough too as Eileen asked me if I was OK. I said ""I'm amazing. In the scheme of things, I'm amazing"". 

What I should have said is ""You're amazing Eileen, thank you""

![Toes](/images/2021/10/toes.jpg)

## Losing 38kg Somehow Makes You Faster?
In the mixed field I came somewhere around the middle. 7th person over 50 (I'm 53). For reference, I came last in the 2010 Bandon Half Marathon and they'd run out of medals by the time I finished the 2012 Dublin Marathon. It's interesting what switching to only eating plants and giving up most booze in January 2020 can do to an old body. I still haven't written that post. The improvement in all my body stats is a bit shocking TBH.

## Zombieland 2 - Double Tap
So yeah, I'll be signing up for the Full next year.

AMA in the comments."
"""2016-08-26T19:32:32+01:00""","The Seven Heads Walk, Fuschia Walk and Lusitania Trail is one of West Cork's best kept secrets. Just go.","Shortly after we moved to Bandon, over 10 years ago, I bought a bunch of Ordnance Survey maps of the area and two books by Damien Enright called ""[Walks of Courtmacsherry Bay & The Seven Heads](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Walks-Courtmacsherry-Seven-Damien-Enright/dp/1902631005)"" and ""Walks in and around Kinsale"". We had high hopes of being outdoorsy. To our shame, the most we ever did was to haul the kids along the short track in Kilbrittain woods, the even shorter one in Ballinspittle woods and the tiny bit longer one in Dromillihy woods.

The lack of places to safely walk in West Cork outside of towns is ridiculous. I have a separate monster blogpost coming that includes this topic. It's a cracker. But this one is about [The Seven Heads](http://www.sevenheadspeninsula.ie/).

{{< youtube 3QOn-AdXV_s >}}

I've recently become very interested in the whole idea of trail running. By interested I mean I watch huge numbers of YouTube videos about it and revel in the incredible achievements of people who do races like [The Barkley Marathons](http://barkleymovie.com/) or [UTMB (Ultra Trail de Mont Blanc)](http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/) which started two hours ago. But a few weeks ago I finally decided I wanted to make some sort of attempt at doing it myself. Of course I had to do a pre-run, so I hauled the smaller kids out to Courtmac and the start of what now seems to be more formally called The Lusitania Trail.

As I did when dragged on walks by my parents, they hated every step. I loved every minute. The route was basically the first recommended short loop. You can read all the details over on the superb pages on [Explore West Cork](http://explorewestcork.ie/walking/seven-heads-walk/). In fact I printed out their directions and made a copy of that section of Map 87. In reality you need none of that, since the whole thing is now signposted as The Lusitania Trail.

It's the ever-changing views that make this such a spectacular walk. You begin in Courtmac, then into woods with beautiful little slipways down to the water, then suddenly the first gobsmacking headland and the Atlantic.

It's a pretty easy walk apart from places where the cows have mushed the ground up badly. Lots of stiles separate the fields and it's completely safe. The Fuschia Walk is absolutely beautiful and you come back through the lovely Ramsey Hill cottages and then on footpath all the way to Courtmac.

![Leaving Woods](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2010.54.36.jpg)
![First Look](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2010.54.50.jpg)

I was so delighted with our trip that I vowed to come back. A few weeks passed and I repeated the route but started in Timoleague and ran most of it.

![Timoleague](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2010.04.42.jpg)

It was tough on the ankles in places but the weather was fantastic so I didn't need trail runners.

![Ankles](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2010.54.54.jpg)

Two weeks later I was back again. This time it was a 15 mile loop that again started in Timoleague. I found that the written directions on Explore West Cork were very hard to follow and I did a lot of recce via Google Maps and the Ordnance Survey map in advance.

![Woods](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2011.06.28.jpg)
![Woods2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2011.06.54.jpg)

In the end, yet again, the entire route was signposted and took almost no thinking on my part. The only place I got confused was on Broadstrand where you have to go the entire length of the beach before you see the steps back up to the road.

![Meelmane](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2011.27.55.jpg)

There is one very steep path up along some fields and then an old pre-Famine road.

![Start famine Road](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07 11.52.16.jpg)

Which eventually brings you out to this amazing view.

![Headlands](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2012.09.01.jpg)


I got to Narry's Cross and then I returned along some very quiet roads via Lislee and a busy main road back into Courtmacsherry.

![Lislee](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2012.42.17.jpg)

I had to take a breather there and have an ice-cream and Lucozade.

![Ice Cream](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2013.13.27.jpg)

And then the final push back to the car in Timoleague.

I fully intend to go again soon and run the entire route which is heading towards Ultra Marathon length. Well, when I say run, I mean run-walk.

The reason I wanted to write this post is that the Seven Heads walk is little more than a name for many people. It's barely a 20 minute drive from Bandon. Probably less from Clonakilty. Much of it is completely off-road with no asshole drivers. If you are looking for some of the best views in the country and a bit of exercise, you owe it to yourself to check it out.

Keep an eye out for my next post which takes this basic topic and turns it into a very long rant about the future of the country's health."
"""2021-04-18T10:00:00+00:00""",The Sheep's Head (Way) - Ambling 51 miles in 21 hours,"## The Unlockdowning
As we approached the partial lifting of pandemic lockdown in Ireland in late March 2021, I wanted to celebrate in some way that involved trails, hills and running. Luckily for me, the brilliant [Tough Soles](https://toughsoles.ie/) published a new summary video [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zcxzrr1Q_HM) of their [Sheep's Head Way hiking trip](https://toughsoles.ie/blog/2018/sheepsheadwaycork/part1) from 2018. I was immediately sold.

## The route
The [official Way web-site](http://thesheepsheadway.ie/) has a ton of useful info including a trace of the whole route. After jumping through some software hoops to convert the KML/KMZ to GPX, I soon had it on Viewranger on my phone and on my Garmin InReach. So at least I wouldn't get lost or my body would be easier to find. Here's my [GPX copy](/images/2021/04/Sheeps_Head_Way_Main_Loop.gpx) in case you want to use it.

![The Route](/images/2021/04/sheeps_head_route.png)

The main loop is 58 miles / 93 km over a variety of surfaces and terrain. It starts in Bantry at the gatehouse of Bantry House, runs mostly off-road along the north side of the peninsula until it reaches the lighthouse and then returns mostly within spitting distance of the main road on the southside, skirting Kilcrohane, Ahakista and Durrus, before ending back where it started.

## The pack
My big worry was time. Would I be able to do it all in one day or would I have to overnight it somehow? I decided to play it safe and assume I'd end up outdoors overnight in April for the first time since I was a boy scout in the 1980s. I ordered a light tent, sleeping bag and MSR gas stove online. Only the stove arrived in time, thanks to the lovely people in [Wild Side Sports](https://wildsidesports.ie/) (and less thanks to the slow-coaches in TrekkInn). 

So the weekend before was very stressful. I opted to use a Patagonia 28L commuter rucksack to carry everything and suddenly remembered I'd bought a Decathlon tarp last year in the staycation panic-buying-phase we we all in during May/June 2020. I also had an old Aldi/Lidl ultra light sleeping bag and lots of bivvy bags and space blankets. Sure I'll be grand I thought.

After packing enough stuff for an assault on K2, including food for three days. I weighed the bag. 13kg. Without water. And I was somehow going to run with this? Some major rejigging later got me to 8kg. But I was so concerned about access to water (despite including both chlorine tablets *and* a Lifestraw) that I added 3 litres in softflasks. So 11-ish kg. Heavy but possibly manageable. I added some bungees as a waist strap just in case.

![The Pack](/images/2021/04/2021-04-11-06.20.38.jpg)

## The start in Bantry
A 4.30am start in Bandon had me at the camper-van car-park in Bantry ready to go at 6.30am on April 12th. Seeing that the main gate in Bantry House was shut, I immediately had to go off-route and just headed out the N71 to get to the side-road and begin the adventure.

After 50 yards I realised I'd made a dreadful mistake with the pack. It was completely impossible to run with it. It not only weighed a ton, it also bounced all over the place and was unbalanced. So I resigned myself to power-hiking the entire thing. Or walking as normal people call it.

![The start](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-06.33.48.jpg)

One thing I noticed about the Way is that it will send you off-road whenever it can, right from the start, even when the road is reasonable. Sometimes I really liked that, particularly when there was something interesting to check out. Other times, much later, it was ""jesus, lumpy fields, again?""

![The phone](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-07.13.03.jpg)


## OMG The views
The first four miles are mostly on-road but felt completely safe with maybe two cars. Once you get off-road, you'll spend the next many hours in awe of the views. Every time you think it can't get any more beautiful, it does. Now to be fair, I picked an absolutely perfect day. Over the entire route I had 5 minutes of drizzle and maybe an hour where it got a bit too hot. Late at night in the dark was the only cold time. There were parts, as you approach the end of the peninsula, that would be terrifying in windy conditions. But for me, everything was crystal clear and fog-free with a gentle breeze.

I adored every minute of the outbound leg.

## Ireland vs The Continent
I met one Eastern European man who had the same idea as me to get as far from his 5km as he possibly could. And a couple of people near the lighthouse later who had presumably driven to the car-park near there. In fact there were more Eastern Europeans than Irish out that day, which is an interesting reflection of our respective relationships with the outdoors I think.

## Navigation
As Ellie from Tough Soles pointed out, the way-marking on this trail is incredibly good. You rarely go more than a few hundred metres without seeing the little yellow person on a pole or a rock. In decent visibility, you rarely need to refer to the electronic route and of course as long as you can see the water, you know you are roughly heading in the right direction.

![Signs 1](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-07.30.52.jpg)

I only spotted one sign pointing completely the wrong way at Glanlough when you reach the road (you turn right, not left). And two that had fallen down. Not bad for 500+ markers! At night they reflect light well, but as I describe later, that wasn't enough to save me towards the end.

![Signs 2](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-07.57.55.jpg)

To use American-lingo, I guess my mini-adventure would be considered an unsupported Thru-Hike, albeit a very short one as it's no PCT or AT. But it's still possible to get in trouble on any trail and to give my wife a degree of comfort that I'm not unconscious somewhere on the trail, I always use my [Garmin InReach Explorer](https://buy.garmin.com/en-IE/GB/p/561269) to ping the old Iridium satellite network every 15 minutes with my location. Its hardware design is like an old school Nokia N95 from 2007 but it is bullet-proof. It worked perfectly throughout the route and still had 65% battery when I checked the following day. The expensive monthly fee is worth it for peace of mind during those active months in the year. In contrast, I was very grumpy that my Garmin Forerunner 935 gave up the ghost in the last mile but I didn't have Ultra Trac mode enabled on it. Separately, I was very surprised to have perfect 4G for almost the entire northside of the route. Presumably that was due to line of sight to towns on the Beara peninsula?

## The difficulty level
That first big leg as far as Glanlough is completely family-friendly. The worst thing you can likely do is scratch your knee or get stuck in some boggy ground.

Speaking of which, the vast majority of the route was very light on the usual West Cork trail bog. I know it hasn't rained much recently but there are plenty of routes in West Cork that are permanently waterlogged. And even more unusually, the route worn into the ground by people and sheep was generally the dryest part. And in many cases, rocks or reeds have been placed down in the bad bits. I managed to get over 30 miles before submerging up to my ankle. And that's when I went off the route for a wee. 

So a huge thank you to everyone involved in maintaining the Sheep's Head Way, including all the landowners.

## The lighthouse
I slowed down quite a bit in the latter miles approaching the end of the peninsula. The ground became much more uneven and rocky and it was hard to get the nice rhythm I had going along the ridge-lines in the earlier sections.

The views around the lighthouse are completely epic. In fact, I realised that I'd been grinning almost continuously for over 11 hours. I also kept saying ""holy fuck"" over and over. It really is that beautiful.

![Lighthouse](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-16.48.42.jpg)

I had my second warm meal and cup of coffee around there on the MSR stove and was glad I'd carried that particular extra weight. Of course, post-pandemic there's an actual cafe a mile up the road. I'd hoped for a bit of gentle road walking for a while after the recent roughness but it was not to be. I was sent immediately off-road after the cafe to see the old WWII look-out and trig point.

## The southside
The main thing about the return leg is that you are rarely more than 20 minutes from a house. So if things do go badly wrong you can get help easily. Mid-pandemic, I'm not sure how many people would welcome you at their door, but in an emergency of course they'd help. 

I was very glad I brought all that water as there was almost nothing out there. And again, with the pandemic I did not want to be bothering any old farmers with a request for a top-up. There were some ropy looking bog lakes and one or two streams/run-offs in the first 45 miles that I'm sure would have been safe with the Lifestraw, but I can imagine what the taste was like. Durrus was the first time I saw an actual water outlet. Maybe something to consider for the future, even in exchange for a donation to a maintenance fund?

There was a chunk of miles along old dirt tracks which were nice and easy and mostly downhill. Plenty of houses and farms too, compared to the northside. But as I approached Kilcrohane, more and more of the route was over fields that were completely churned up by cows and very hard to walk on as the ground had dried out. 

## Cowwwwwwwwwwws
Worse, I had multiple encounters with extremely exuberant herds of cows and young bulls. The first one was actually terrifying. Imagine 20+ large animals suddenly seeing you and all simultaneously barrelling at you at full tilt. I had no bloody idea cows could move that fast. I backed out to the field entrance and they all crowded around me. I could see no route around so, with running poles akimbo to make myself bigger, I started walking through them. Some of them followed me quietly, some lost their minds in fear and raced off to a safe distance. Others kicked their hind legs up like bucking broncos. Finally I got to the other side of the field, climbed the stile and breathed a huge sigh of relief.

Except that happened three more times. I realised afterwards that I was probably the first person any of them had seen, apart from the farmers, in months. They were bored out of their minds. I have to apologise to the farmer who I could hear shouting after his herd, trying to get them from one field to the next, after they'd all legged it after me.

As a mostly edge-of-townie, I still don't know how much danger I was in. I obviously know enough to watch out for small calves and giant big-bollocks bulls, but I don't know if there's a better way to deal with ""enthusiasm"" that could get you a hoof in the head.

## The dark
At this point it was now dark and the temperature plummeted. I got out the head-torches and trudged along. There wasn't a sinner to be seen in Kilcrohane itself. Once off-road again (more cows), I began to find it harder and harder to navigate. When I could see the waymarker reflections in the distance, it was fine, but when I couldn't, it was too easy to veer left or right off the ""track"". I was constantly having to stop and check [Viewranger](https://www.viewranger.com/en-gb) and started getting cold too. 

By the time I got to near Ahakista, I was running out of energy. I was now 16 hours on my feet, beating my previous record of 14 hours for the [Liverpool to Manchester 50 miler](https://conoroneill.com/2018/04/08/from-liverpool-to-manchester-conor-does-50-before-50/). So in the scrubland above the village, I decided to call it a day and try to get some shut eye. I took off my runners, got out the tarp and sleeping bag  and rolled myself up like a burrito in both.

A complete waste of time. 15 minutes of hard-ground agony and jumpy legs later, I packed it all up and started trudging again. Now I was freezing and couldn't even find the road that was clearly nearby given the house lights I could see. Eventually I climbed some barbed-wire and got on the road. 

I calculated that I was probably looking at something like another 7 hours to finish and I did not have that in me. My wife offered to collect me but I wasn't completely done yet. I did wonder if Bantry taxis ever take calls in the middle of the night to collect people from the trail :)

## Blisters, I'll show you blisters
One thing I forgot to mention was that I had hot-spots on both of my forefeet from very early on. I was wearing Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX runners which didn't have many miles in them but I've been wearing various Hokas for years and never had any issues before. These are my first Gore-Tex runners and OMG, it's incredible to not have wet feet running off-road. I can only imagine how quickly my feet would have deteriorated without the Gore-Tex. Whilst I was able to avoid the really boggy stuff, it was still very wet in many places.

But at this stage the hot-spots were raging big blisters that made every step torture. So I finally accepted that I wasn't going to finish the ""Way"" but I thought I could get back to Bantry ok if I stuck to the road and walked more on my heels.

I got to the junction in Ahakista and saw the sign ""Bantry 19km"". Some slow-brain maths later and I thought ""oh jesus that's four hours at my current pace"". 

## The Road
So that's what I did.

I met two vehicles in that entire section. I thought it would never end. I could see the lights of Durrus for hours. But some strongly worded self-talk kept me going ok. Particularly Yvon Chouinard's famous ""For me, when everything goes wrong, that's when adventure starts"".

And 21 hours after I started, I arrived back to my car grinning like an idiot.

![The End](/images/2021/04/2021-04-13-03.28.30.jpg)


## And I'm feeling good
Whilst I'm disappointed I didn't finish the Way route, I'm actually over-the-moon about a bunch of things. I've never gone so far on foot. I've never done an activity which lasted so long, I've never done any sort of night-time off-road hiking/running, I've never carried a pack that far and I've never done that many miles in the hills. I was also really happy in that first 10-12 hours with how damned good I felt. I seemed to have boundless energy. I blame all those plants I've been eating since January 2020. Whilst the Sheep's Head Way doesn't have very much ascent/descent, it's not exactly flat and I did over 7000ft of elevation.

{{< youtube Q0njKqHDVuA >}}

On a different day with tougher soles (sorry Ellie and Carl) and my usual 5L Salomon pack with a few gels and bars, I think I'd be able to run much of it and finish in daylight. I won't freak myself out by checking what FKT one of the Cork and Kerry Trail Runners mountain goats has, but I'll be happy to claim the SKT (Slowest Known Time) in the future.

## Fame
As I said afterwards on Instagram, I really do think The Sheep's Head Way should be world famous. I've lived in West Cork for 18 years and have been running for 12 years and I was only vaguely aware of it as maybe some sort of less-famous ""spur"" of the Beara Way. It's not just mind-bogglingly beautiful, it's very very runnable for huge chunks of it. 

Here's the [Relive.cc](https://www.relive.cc/) animation of the route:

<video src=""/images/2021/04/VID_124520921_072824_731.mp4"" controls></video>

I'm aiming to run anything that looks even vaguely like a trail in Cork whilst we're still in county lockdown and I suspect I may be back on The Sheep's Head again in 2021 for another go.

## Next?
In the meantime where should I try next? I've done bits of [Slí Gaeltacht Mhuscraí](http://www.sligaeltachtmuscrai.com/sgm.html) ([Tough Soles page](https://toughsoles.ie/blog/2018/4-1)) near Gougane Barra / [The Beara Way](https://www.bearabreifneway.ie/beara-way/) ([Tough Soles page](https://toughsoles.ie/blog/the-beara-way)) near Glengarriff. Are there other really good long loops you can do in Cork that are possible without needing support/lifts? And is there *anything* on Mizen? I spent a lot of last week's fun staring at it.

## Final words
So whether you are a hiker, walker, road runner, trail runner or person who just likes gorgeous views, you should get your ass to The Sheep's Head. Just leave the dogs at home, they are rightly not allowed. And make sure you leave no trace except your footprints.

Finally, once again, thank you to everyone involved in making The Sheep's Head Way such a magical and manageable route."
"""2021-06-07T11:00:00+00:00""",The Sheep's Head Way Fastest Known Time (FKT),"## If at first
On April 12th 2021 [I attempted to do](/2021/04/18/the-sheeps-head-way-ambling-51-miles-in-21-hours/) the entire main loop of [The Sheep's Head Way](http://thesheepsheadway.ie/). I didn't quite make it but had an amazing day in a wonderful part of the world. Five weeks later on May 17th, I gave it another go. Whilst it didn't go to plan, the outcome left me with a big old grin on my face for a week.

## No you don't need a gas cooker
The two main problems I had the first time were my ridiculous pack full of everything from a gas cooker to a sleeping bag, along with the horrendous blisters on the soles of my feet. This time I pulled out my usual Salomon 5L running pack, bought a ton of energy/protein bars and replaced all the sleeping/safety gear with a single mylar space blanket. So really the bulk of the weight was just a water bladder and two hydraflasks.

![Salomon Pack](/images/2021/05/salomon.jpg)

## And he's off again
I managed to get to Bantry a bit earlier and set off at 5:50am from the gatehouse of Bantry House. All of the gates were closed due to the pandemic, so as before I stuck to the main road for the first section.

![Start](/images/2021/05/start.jpg)

Yet again I picked a perfect day for it. Not too hot, not too cold, no rain. The ground was a lot wetter than the previous attempt but not a quagmire. I was still very happy with how the Goretex on the Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX worked in those conditions. I deftly dodged any deep bog and managed to keep the feet dry all day. To avoid the blisters I went completely overboard and fully taped the front half of my feet and my toes with zinc oxide tape. And it bloody worked - not a single blister in 60 miles!

## Oh oh he's down
Everything was going brilliantly well. I couldn't even feel the pack on my back and I was eagerly running the flats and the downs. 

![Dawn](/images/2021/05/dawn.jpg)

But then, as I headed downhill towards Glanlough, I stepped on to a slick slab and, whoosh, my legs flew from under me and I landed face-down on the slab on my right hip. For a split second I thought I might have gone full OAP and broken it, but as I hauled myself up, I realised it wasn't too bad. Unfortunately a few footsteps later revealed that I'd pulled something in my right knee and something in the left hip. I went from happily bouncing along to gingerly tip-toeing on anything that looked wet and making sure both running poles were firmly planted with each step. My confidence was shot.

## Only two marathons to go
Bit by bit, I ran less and less. The pain in the knee got steadily worse and made running downhill very painful. The pain in the hip matched it perfectly and made everything uphill very painful. But I was able to speedhike reasonably well. By the time I got the end of the peninsula, I was two hours up on the previous attempt. And as before I was in a great place mentally. This time I had little doubt I was going to finish, unless the knee/hip did something catastrophic.

![View](/images/2021/05/view.jpg)

It was lovely to see the cafe at the head open for business and it was hopping with people. I ran into a duo twice who were doing a shorter looped hike and got a lovely beep from them many hours later in Durrus as I click-clacked through.

## I'll have the water with bits in
The first time around I was extremely worried about the water situation and brought tons, which I didn't fully use. This time I was just as concerned and became more so as the day progressed due to the heat. Luckily the recent rain meant that all the previous rivulets were now little streams. Finally towards the end of the peninsula I decided to give it a go. I found an accessible decent sized stream with no sign of livestock and refilled one of the hydraflasks. I dropped a chlorine dioxide tablet in and waited 15 minutes for it to do its magic. And wow, it tasted fine. Not like a swimming pool or sheep's arse at all. But there were bits. Of unknown origin. 

I have to admit I bought a hydraflask with a built in filter when I got home. For the next time.

## Full-fat Coke
The last time I got to Kilcrohane, it was a ghosttown late at night. This time it was buzzing in the late afternoon and gorgeous sun. I stopped at the PostOffice/Cafe/Shop/Everything and got some fizzy water, sweets and full-fat coke. I'm not sure when we started calling the red can full-fat but it totally makes sense in my head. And it's the ultimate drink over very long distances to give you a boost.

![Coke](/images/2021/05/coke.jpg)

## Pretty pretty pretty good
Apart from the hip/knee, I was having a fantastic day. I made it to Ahakista and the spot where I had attempted to sleep in a moment of despair a month earlier. Between my increased speed and the extra daylight, it was still bright at this point and I could see that my only mistake had been going slightly off to one side and missing the very obvious track in the dark the previous time. It really reinforced how much more difficult off-road is in the dark.

This time, I was all fired-up to do the full Way properly so I kept to the official route. There is one small mistake in the Google Maps track on the website near Ahakista so you should just trust the waymarkers around there. They are correct. 

It was slow going and the aches and pains were a lot worse but overall everything was still fundamentally good. I made it to Durrus at 9.30pm and it was jammers with people. A bit of a change from 1am the previous time.

There was a dodgy road section for a few miles which I really didn't like. Fast moving cars and vans and not a hell of a lot of verge.

## Cowwwwwwssssss
After the relentless cows of the last attempt, I almost felt lonely this time. None of my scary beefy buddies were around to run towards me at full tilt. In fact on the entire route I was only in one field with cows. It was a little concerning as there were small calves with their mothers but everyone just ignored me. 

Another group clearly recognised me from across a hedge and were outraged they couldn't hang out with their bestie Conor as they ran along parallel.

Oh also, the Alpacas in Kilcrohane totally pretended I wasn't there.

## Hello darkness my old friend
The sun dropped and I pulled in to a field to add another layer, plus my light jacket, beanie and headtorch. I was starting to get stressed about the final off-road section. I had no idea how rough it would be. A few minutes later I went up a side-road and then out on to fields.

As I predicted, this was by far the hardest part of the route. The knee/hip were in a very bad way. The waymarkers were obviously much harder to find in the dark and there was a ton of up/down/up/down on mixed terrain. But at least it wasn't remotely technical or dangerous. The ups in particular were proving extremely painful. But step by step and pole by pole I clicked-clacked on. At a route fork, I even took the ""scenic route"" in the pitch dark rather than the road back to the N71.

## All roads lead to Bantry
Suddenly I found myself on the main N71 approx 10km from Bantry. Yet again there were two options. Take the main road (similar to the last time) or follow a much smaller and hillier route that ran roughly parallel. The thought of being ploughed down by some late-night driver worried me enough that I took the latter option.

The first section was much better than I expected. It was just a forest road which became a tiny lane, then a tiny road, then a bigger road and finally a decent regional road into Bantry. But jesus the hills. They were killing me. It felt like I was barely moving. Each step became more and more painful. If it wasn't for those Black Diamond Carbon FLZ poles, I would have been a goner many hours before. I somehow managed to avoid hand blisters too.

## You're nearly there
That hilarious sign you see at every marathon which gives you murderous thoughts suddenly popped into my head. Even tho I was a few hundred yards from the start/finish spot, the route veers away and back towards Bantry House. The pandemic gate situation meant I had to go even further away and back onto the N71 footpath to retrace my initial steps in reverse.

A cop car passed by slowly. I have no doubt the word ""nutter"" was uttered quietly. 

I passed my own parked car and step by awful step I made it back to the gatehouse. And done.

![End](/images/2021/05/end.jpg)

60.64 miles (97.6km) in 21:31:08 finishing at almost 3.30am.

I took a minute. I may have grinned like the aforementioned nutter for another minute or so.

Here's a slightly ropy Google Earth flyover of the route:

<video src=""/images/2021/05/Sheeps-Head-Way-Tour-Fast-480p.mp4"" controls></video>

## Fastest Known Time (FKT)
I'm a big fan of the US [FKT](https://fastestknowntime.com/) thing. It's a nice bottom-up way of creating a bit of competition amongst people and highlighting trails and routes that may not be very well known. As a concept it hasn't really caught on in Ireland yet. I suspect the incredible [Iveragh Traverse](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1328420757249671/permalink/4023865234371863/) by Kevin Leahy and Joe O’Leary may change that. 

So, for fun and maybe to goad some serious runners into doing a serious time on The Sheep's Head Way, I submitted my time/route and it was accepted! So I now have the [""official"" Fastest Known Time on The Sheep's Head Way](https://fastestknowntime.com/fkt/conor-oneill-sheeps-head-way-ireland-2021-05-18). I figure any member of [IMRA/MMRA](https://imra.ie/events/) could easily do it twice as fast. Go on, you know you want to.

Garmin version of [route here](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/6798090213). [Strava here](https://www.strava.com/activities/5315312089).

Sidenote: [Please donate a few quid](https://fundit.ie/project/1000-km-of-chaos) to get [1000 KM of Chaos](https://vimeo.com/500936959) made. It's a movie about Kevin.

## Unsupported vs Self-Supported
My plan for the route had been to do it unsupported. This means no help from anyone and you carry everything in your pack except for optionally getting water in streams etc. And I almost did that. Except for Kilcrohane. Getting those few bits in the shop, which I really didn't need, except maybe mentally, resulted in it not being an Unsupported FKT, it's a Self-Supported one.

Obviously it's the kind of safe short route that almost anyone could do Unsupported.

## The Aftermath
So what happens to a 53 year old body after doing two and a bit marathons on a dodgy knee and a dodgy hip? Well he's tired for a week. And then he gets vaccinated with J&J a week later and is doubly floored. 

But the knee is the real problem. Here I am three weeks later and I can't do more than a mile before it flares up viciously with pain on the outside. Doctor Google says I have IT Band Syndrome which sounds right. But three weeks doing little more than walking and it hasn't really improved at all. The hip glitches a bit but is clearly getting better every day. 

Weirdly, a 3 mile run on the Seven Heads was very sore whilst a 12 mile hike with my wife on a [shorter Sheep's Head loop](https://www.strava.com/activities/5425613675) was completely pain free the following day.

What the hell am I moaning about? 97km in one day and ooh my knee is a bit sore! That's a result by any measure.

## Final words
Finally, as I said the last time, thank you to everyone involved in making The Sheep's Head Way such a magical and manageable route."

"""2016-10-02T18:45:00+01:00""",Timoleague to Courtmacsherry and initial impressions of Elephone Explorer Pro,"One of my fave things to do is watch videos made by Ultra Marathon runners and videographers. The views are always stunning and instantly make me want to go out for a run. My first attempt to do similar in Run Forest Run was a bit of a disaster as the rain killed my phone.

We've had an action camera for a few years that my bro-in-law kindly gave us. It's a Contour GPS. I love the GPS aspect of it but the lack of a screen, the weirdness with the bluetooth and the inability to use SD cards bigger than 2GB meant we didn't use it much.

I wanted to get something new but didn't want to dish out $499 for a GoPro Hero 4 (and now 5) when I might not use it that much. I was very impressed by the reviews of the Yi 2 but that's still $279. There are a ton of <$100 ones on all of the Chinese sites with SJCam probably being the best known, but the video quality in general looked horrendous.

Then 2 weeks ago whilst checking out some recent ones on Gearbest, I found the [Elephone Explorer Pro](http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_314991.html). Unlike most of the other brands, these seem to be a serious company with a range of phones too. The various review and unboxing videos I found all looked pretty good and if they are telling the truth, they are using a Sony sensor with a Novatek NTK96660 chipset.

![Elephone Explorer Pro](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/elecam_03.jpg)

Of course I'm not clueless and ignored the 4K claims. It's just 1080p scaled up. But I was happy to go for 1080p60 on a device that cost less than $100 and came with all the bits you'd want like a waterproof case.

I made the rookie error of using DHL delivery, so of course it got caught in Irish customs and I had to pay VAT and Import duty of more than €30 but it's still good value.

Today it had it's first outing as I ran the lovely route from Timoleague to Courtmacsherry and back. I took multiple video clips and photos.

Main thoughts:

* Damn it's small! I love that

![Small](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/elecam_01.jpg)


* No problem taking a 32GB SD Card
* The remote control is great and has different buttons for video and stills
* I zip-tied the remote control to the selfie-stick (the stick makes video less wobbly)
* The screen is rubbish so it's hard to see in sunlight whether video is recording or not
* There is a status led but it's tiny so it doesn't help
* The waterproof case seems great but I haven't tried it properly
* The bunch of adapters is also great but the back-mount is strange since it has a camera mount, not a GoPro one
* It seems to be roughly the same size as a GoPro Hero 3/4 and I could 3D print a case for it

![Case](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/elecam_02.jpg)

* Images aren't bad

* The video below was taken with it in the waterproof case. I don't know how much of an effect that has, apart from all the JJ Abrams lens flare. You can decide yourself if it's good enough. I had the ""gyroscope"" feature enabled which seemed to help with wobble.

However, comparing to the source, that generated file is much lower quality. Most of the pixellation seems to have been caused by Pinnacle Studio, rather than YouTube. 

[One of the source files](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016_1002_101235_007.MP4) for comparison.

UPDATE 1: I did another run on the Lusitania Trail this morning and it's proven that the battery is a bad joke. From full charge I got 10 minutes recording time whilst it was powered up for one hour, before it shut down with low battery. That's completely useless. I'll be asking for a replacement battery from GearBest now as hopefully it's not a design flaw in the camera. I'll post the video footage later.

UPDATE 2: Looking at the video quality from today's run, it's pretty rubbish, even before Pinnacle pixellates it. Everything is either burnt out or too dark and its all blurry. I just compared it to some footage I took of the same location on the old Contour GPS a few months ago and the 5 year old Contour kicks its ass.

"""2016-09-19T18:53:32+01:00""",Tough as Leather - The Story of Sporting Legend John Lenihan,"Finally a book review on the blog. I'm not sure where I heard about this book, probably Twitter, but damn it's a great story. I'd never heard of John Lenihan until 3 weeks ago. Then I read this [Irish Times article](http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/tough-as-leather-john-lenihan-the-conqueror-of-carrauntoohil-1.2273089) and my jaw was on the floor. He has not only won the Carrauntoohil mountain race 19 times, he still holds the record of 1 hour 11 minutes and 43 seconds. Read that again. Up and down the highest mountain in Ireland in 1:11:43.

His story is genuinely interesting and he comes across as a honourable talented hard-working man who will probably never get the adulation he deserves.

"""2021-10-15T04:00:00+00:00""",Tre Cime di Lavaredo - A European wonder hiding in plain sight,"## I got those Pandemic City Blues
Four weeks ago I'd never heard of [Tre Cime di Lavaredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tre_Cime_di_Lavaredo). Last weekend we hiked around it and I'm still struggling to find the English to describe the beauty of what we saw. How we got there is kind of a funny story. 

We humans have an ability to let trauma fade, which helps us in countless ways from childbirth and broken limbs to the death of loved ones. It strikes me that many of us have already forgotten just how awful things were in April, May and June 2020. The extreme lockdown in Ireland achieved its aims but I particularly remember those three months being the hardest of all mentally. And for others, it was far far worse than that.

Whilst I love doing my trail runs and little hikes, I'm a total neophyte to the wider world of hiking and mountaineering. Apart from reading [Chris Bonington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bonington) books in the Kilkenny City library as a kid and watching Free Solo, I know nothing.

## London Mountain Film Festival (LMFF)
By late April I was looking for any distraction from the relentless nothingness of the same loops over and over and over on the local roads. But somehow, possibly via the BBC Adventure Show or similar, I read about the [London Mountain Film Festival](https://www.londonmountainfestival.com/) (LMFF) on Twitter and signed up to stream the movies/documentaries to break the boredom.

I'd already watched the lovely [Paddy O'Leary's Coming Home](https://vimeo.com/406878212) and I recognised some names like ledgebags Ultra Damo and Beth Pascall [doing Cape Wrath](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wrath-Beth-Pascall/dp/B08HZ87SKD). But most of it was completely new to me. And what a wonderful set of movies, shorts and documentaries it proved to be. For a change I was crying tears of joy watching Mel Nicholls in [Dream Big](https://vimeo.com/370039186), Trevor Kennison in [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hiwfuyy4v0) and ""The East German Ladies Swimming Team"" in [The Home For Broken Toys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11277452/).

But there was so many, I never got to the end. Maybe once a month I have been dipping in over the past year+ and each one has been a gem. 

This brings us up to mid September 2021. Our wedding anniversary was coming up and, like many people, we hadn't had a proper holiday in two years. We decided to treat ourselves and book the Cliff House Hotel in Ardmore for a night along with the vegan tasting menu. 

## Dolomite is my name and 
A few days later, I was doing another dip into the LMFF playlist and I discovered this odd long documentary called [The Great Peak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqDFds6N1To). For a start it's in subtitled German. It opens with an older guy who has spectacular hair. I recognise him from maybe one of the Kílian Jornet documentaries. It turns out he is [Reinhold Messner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Messner) and is one of the greatest mountaineers ever, having done things like the first solo ascent of Everest!

Reinhold is talking about a very special set of peaks in the Dolomite Mountains called Drei Zinnen. The camera pans to show them and my jaw hits the floor. As I said in the opener, I don't have the vocabulary to describe them. Majestic doesn't do them justice. Other-worldly? Perfection? I don't know. But I was immediately glued to every word he spoke.

![Drei Zinnen](/images/2021/10/tcl_social_share.jpg)

His thesis is that many thousands of people go there every year, take a selfie, have a drink and head home without hiking around it to see the full impact of how amazing the peaks and surroundings are. The movie then takes a strange turn and decides to recreate the first ascent of Tre Cime/Drei Zinnen in 1869, by Paul Grohmann, with actors/climbers in period-appropriate clothing and climbing gear. It was all very low budget and clunky and terrifying, given their gear. It progresses to show each of the major achievements on the peaks since then, including the still-shocking 2002 free solo of the north face. It's a fantastic informative documentary and you should seek it out.

## Step 1 - Find the right country
Later that evening I told Catherine about it and how ""we should go there sometime"". At this point I still didn't know where ""there"" was.

Catherine's response? ""Let's go. Cancel the anniversary stay in Ardmore and go there instead"". I knew instantly she was right. We've really been embracing the carpe diem thing since last year. We could be dead. Even tho I think I only met [Nigel Pim](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/lives-lost-to-covid-19-nigel-pim-quaker-and-kidney-donor-died-in-january-aged-50-1.4480046) once and interacted with him many years ago on Twitter, his death from Covid hit me more than any other, due to his age, fitness and connections to those I know in Tramore.

I immediately switched into Hell-Yeah Mode. But first, where are they? Italy? Austria? Solvenia? A few seconds googling confirmed that Tre Cime are less than a 3 hour drive north of Venice and they are in Italy right beside the old Austro-Hungarian empire border. 

I quickly figured out that Ryanair Dublin-Treviso and a hotel in Cortina d'Ampezzo was what we needed along with a 4WD rental car just in case (just in case Conor wants to drive a jeep for the first time more like, eh?)

The plan was: Drive to Dublin because Cork Airport is run by geniuses, fly Friday night, stay in a cheap hotel in Treviso, get the car on Saturday morning along with picnic provisions, drive to Tre Cime, do the hike, stay in a good hotel in Cortina d'Ampezzo, do another hike on Sunday, go ""somewhere"" on Monday, fly home late Monday night, back to Cork.

(Update: Ryanair has just announced flights from Cork to Venice (VCE) on Tuesdays and Saturdays from March 29, 2022!)

## Treviso
Overall it worked out incredibly well with only minor glitches like a motorcyclist nearly killing us both on a hairpin mountain bend. It started badly with Passport Control taking over an hour to process one plane. But the [B&B Hotel Treviso](https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Hotel_Review-g187869-d13387547-Reviews-B_B_Hotel_Treviso-Treviso_Province_of_Treviso_Veneto.html) turned out to be great value, basic but clean, friendly and filled with vending machines. Less than 10 mins in a taxi. Also the only hotel where I've ever been asked if I wanted sweet or salt for my breakfast. What a brilliant compact way of putting things.

We used Leasys for the car which worked out fine but I suspect they only have a small number of vehicles compared to the big brands. The vehicle itself was a Jeep Cherokee. How something can be that big on the outside and that small on the inside I will never know. A reverse Tardis. The drive went from motorway to small road, to smaller road, to oh jesus we're going to die. But when we got there, we hit a multi-mile car tailback going up to the start of the hike. I was reminded of the old ""you're not in traffic, you are traffic"" line. 45 minutes and 50 metres later, I did a U-ey. So much for low season and no crowds.

We stopped in Misurina and ate our picnic beside the gorgeous lake. More mind-boggling views. Then twisty-twisty mountain road all the way to Cortina d'Ampezzo.

![Misurina](/images/2021/10/tcl_misurina_lake.jpg)


## I don't think your uncle Harry would approve
As I'm not a skier and 1981 was a very long time ago, I had never heard of Cortina either, unless that's what the car is named after. But it is famous as a ski resort and as the location for some set-pieces in [For Your Eyes Only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Your_Eyes_Only_(film)). For fun we tried to watch it that night. Oh dear, those Roger Moore era James Bond movies have not aged well. Interesting that Cortina looked almost identical back then.

Then another fantastic discovery happened. I wondered if the famous [Lavaredo Ultra Trail LUT](https://www.ultratrail.it/en/) was held anywhere near us, given the name. Hah, it starts and finishes outside the front-door of our hotel! So once checked in, we walked the first tiny bit of the race until it went vertically up. LUT is getting added to my ""not some day, 2022"" list now. 

Almost all of the hotels were shut in the region as we'd managed to pick the week after the end of the summer season. [Hotel Cortina](https://www.hotelcortina.com/) was just about to close but was absolutely lovely and again everyone was so friendly. I have to thank the manager who brought me to their secret car parking area and hilariously berated my driving the whole way there. By the end of it, I was Giuseppe Farina. Fun moments like that stay with you long after.

![Hotel Cortina](/images/2021/10/tcl_hotel_view.jpg)


## Would you like some cheese with your cheese?
Now we get to the only downside of the trip. If you don't survive solely on a diet of meat and cheese, you're going to struggle in Northern Italy. Remember this is a place where 60+% of people speak German and it still has that strong Austro-Hungarian thing going on. So dried meat, cured meat, hunted meat, Irish beef (really!) and cheese are your options. Even tho I turned vegan in 2020, I couldn't help be impressed by the supermarket having an entire section dedicated to mozzarella.

The poor [Happy Cow app](https://www.happycow.net/) could really only recommend one Japanese fusion place in all of Cortina plus some places that had veggie options. But we did some digging and realised many places will do a Marinara pizza which doesn't have cheese. The ones from [Ai Due](https://g.page/aiduefornicortina?share) were superb. And another proper Italian moment - All of their pizzas had two toppings and he literally wouldn't let me add another. So basically ask him for Marinara con verdure to get aubergine and courgette.

The following night we ate in [Il Ponte](https://www.ilpontecortina.it/). This is a standard tourist joint with a massive menu including Hawaiian pizza :-) Rather than ask for vegan options, I realised the simplest thing in Italy is to improvise yourself from the menu. So Mariana pizza con rucola e olive was fabulous (rocket and olives, plus the capers from Catherine's salad). Her salad wasn't great but the simple pasta with tomato sauce was fantastic. And she could have asked them to add various veg etc. You could easily work up a multitude of variations of pasta or pizza that are no extra work for the kitchen since they are making them all to order anyway. A lovely bottle of Pinot Nero to go finished off our night nicely.

![It Ponte](/images/2021/10/marinara_pizza_il_ponte.jpg)

Wait a second, this post has completely gone off the rails hasn't it?

## Tre Cime, OMFG
Right, we got up early on Sunday, filled up on breakfast and drove up to Tre Cime. Catherine had to close her eyes for the last couple of miles of relentless hair-pin bends and minimal armco. Quick tip - there is a toll on the last long section up to main carpark of €30. You can park before there and hike up but it's a couple of hours at least. There were no traffic jams at 9am but the carpark at [Rifugio Auronzo](https://goo.gl/maps/STrGX3E3GPDTHD4c7) was almost full when we got there. Early my ass.

It was gorgeously sunny but freezing up there. If you are doing this, possibly at any time of the year, wear warm clothing including a hat and gloves. My thin TNF gloves weren't warm enough and my running tights were a bit too wind-transparent. Our puffas were ideal tho. 

Initial views over the valleys were incredible and I was surprised to see everything from small kids to OAPs heading off on their hikes. 

![Valley from Start](/images/2021/10/tcl_valley_start.jpg)

We turned the corner and caught our first glimpse of Tre Cime. Holy fuck. And that's how it went for the entire hike in terms of descriptive language.

![View from Start](/images/2021/10/tcl_start_of_hike.jpg)


Oh I forgot to mention that I'd bought two maps - [Kompass Naturpark Drei Zinnen](https://www.mapsworldwide.com/maps-charts-atlases-c1811/walking-hiking-maps-c1814/kompass-karten-gmbh-kompass-map-047-naturpark-drei-zinnen-parco-naturale-tre-cime-di-lavaredo-p21233) and [Tabacco 03 Cortina d'Ampezzo e Dolomiti Ampezane](https://www.mapsworldwide.com/maps-charts-atlases-c1811/cortina-dampezzo-dolomiti-ampezzane-tabacco-map-03-p13147) along with the [Cicerone Shorter Walks in The Dolomites](https://www.cicerone.co.uk/shorter-walks-in-the-dolomites-third) book. The route we were taking around the peaks was Walk 9 from the book. Surprisingly they don't provide GPX files online but I found one that seemed to match their written route and loaded it on to [Outdoors Online]() on my phone and Garmin InReach.

Speaking of which, my [Strava for the hike is here](https://www.strava.com/activities/6091762182) along with downloadable GPX.

The first stretch of the route was fine and got a little steep up to a fabulous spot at Forcella Lavaredo that had views for many miles in all directions. Tre Cime itself just got more and more impressive as you saw it from each new angle. 

![Side View](/images/2021/10/tcl_side_view.jpg)


## Slip sliding away
Then things went pear-shaped badly. The downhill on the other side was in the shade and was covered in rock-hard snow and ice. I have no idea if that's there all year round or if there had been a snowfall recently. But it caused minor chaos. There was a thin relatively clear strip along the edge with a drop off so we weren't doing that (hats off to the young uns who did). My Hoka Speedgoats were gripping brilliantly, but Catherine's Pegasus Trails were useless. But before proper hikers get sniffy about the footwear, everyone struggled except for those who came prepared with micro-spikes. One young guy ended up on his arse in expensive looking Salomon boots. 

![Ice Start](/images/2021/10/tcl_snow_ice_start.jpg)

It took us forever to edge down. The Black Diamond poles once again proved to be worth every penny. Catherine was terrified but we kept going as it was easier than trying to go back up. It wasn't particularly dangerous as the track is quite wide and it would be possible to get slowly down on your very wet arse if you wished. Some people overtook us but the majority stayed stuck at the top for a long time and we left them far behind us. I am sure most who didn't have decent footwear or poles turned around.

![Ice End](/images/2021/10/tcl_snow_ice_end_2.jpg)

It was extremely cold in the shade but we relaxed a bit once the track dried out and we headed up to Rifugio Locatelli. We'd have murdered a coffee at that stage but it was shut. 

![Steep Back 1](/images/2021/10/tcl_north_side_steep_back.jpg)

The route down to the plain was very easy and the track back up was clear but very steep. Even the twenty-somethings were stopping regularly to catch their breaths. Remember, for Paddies, our starting point was at more than twice the elevation of Carrauntoohil.

![Steep Back 2](/images/2021/10/tcl_north_side_steep_back2.jpg)


## Is this even real?
Many many many pictures were being taken and the sense of ""this feels like I'm in a painting"" never left me. 

![North Valley Panorama](/images/2021/10/tcl_panorama_valley.jpg)


The last time I felt like that was above the Grand Canyon in the 90s. When your brain sees something completely new and of that scale, it struggles to make sense of it. Like the first astronauts looking down for the first time maybe.

![North Face](/images/2021/10/tcl_north_face_2.jpg)


Just when we thought the last mile or so would be a doddle, we hit a repeat of the first problem. Which was surprising since it wasn't in the shade. Interestingly, despite the drop-off, we'd both got a lot more comfortable with the edge and used that since it was clear and dry rather than trying to fight the packed snow again.

The only tiny wrinkle before we got back to the start was a spot where the trail had collapsed and what remained was covered in slippy ice. You could easily fall to your death there. Given all the tourists, it really needs to be rebuilt. We tip-toed incredibly carefully across.

![Valley Near End](/images/2021/10/tcl_valley_near_end.jpg)


When I first read about this route, I thought 6 miles would take no time at all and we might need to do a second hike to fill the day. It took us 3.5 hours!! That's a new low-speed record for me.

We were both wrecked after the effort of it all and luckily the canteen-style cafe in Rifugio Auronzo had polenta, roasted mushrooms and roasted aubergine, almost like they were expecting me or something :-)

## Flyover
Here's a fairly glitchy but still cool [Fatmap flyover](https://fatmap.com/adventureid/11434623/tre-cime-di-lavaredo-hike) of the hike. Follow that Fatmap link to interact with it yourself.

{{< youtube Rj13u9hobmk >}}

## Venice Schmenice
The following day we did a few hours in Venice which is still to be avoided at all costs. I don't know how they are going to fix it but do yourself a favour - skip it and do Tre Cime instead. Up there, you won't find insane crowds in narrow passageways, ridiculous fashion shops or awful pizza, just that wonder of the natural world. But if you do insist on Venice, we had a lovely simple vegan meal in [Ogio](https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d7147203-Reviews-Ogio-Venice_Veneto.html). My final vegan tip - the cafes in Treviso airport all have a range of soy-milk coffees as does Hotel Cortina.

## Just do it
This post was not originally going to be very long. It was supposed to just be an ode to Tre Cime but I figured I may as well make it useful if you are thinking of going.

My two main takeaways about our trip were:

[1] How Covid has had some positive impacts. From finding incredible routes in Ireland like [The Sheep's Head Way](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/) to discovering Tre Cime and now seeking out other ""hidden"" gems. It's ridiculous how little of Europe we have visited. What other epic places should we know about?

[2] How lucky we are to be European and to easily be able to get to such amazing places barely a few hours from our front door and hang out with our European brothers and sisters.

Any questions about the trip or the logistics, just shout.

"""2021-09-20T07:00:00+00:00""",Twenty years of blogging on conoroneill.com,"I somehow missed the actual [20th Anniversary of the Blog](https://conoroneill.com/2001/04/17/first-post/) back in April and finally noticed last week. This could be a massive post with links to highlights and lowlights over the past twenty years but I think I'd prefer to keep it short.

![Twenty Years A Blogging](/images/2021/09/20_years_a_bloggin.png)

After using Frontpage in the 90s and hosting a ""homepage"" on Indigo, Geocities and others, I made the move to Blogger on April 17th 2001. That was followed by the golden years of blogging from 2006-2010 on WordPress and eventually the move via various static site generators to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a few years back. 

My output ranged from multiple posts per day to sometimes only one post in a year, but I never lost the bug. Even when I wasn't blogging I'd be thinking ""that'd make a great blogpost"". But in recent years it usually became a throwaway Tweet that disappeared into the ether, never to be read again (or even the first time).

And that's why I'll keep plugging away here as people's communications fashions come and go. There is something important in the history of people's activity on the internet having longevity. I've ranted about Yahoo's cultural terrorism in the past and I'm even more concerned that everything that happens on Social and Private Messaging could disappear forever at the whim of a tech-bro.

It's why [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) is so important. And why we need something like it and like [GitHub's Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) for all of those conversations that deserve archival. If an asteroid wipes us out, will future entities think that we stopped communicating with each other in 2007?

Whilst a lot of what I posted here over twenty years was rubbish, there have been some posts that people have found useful or valuable. Year in, year out, Google Analytics tells me the same small set of useful/non-opinion posts get most of the traffic here and on [my tech blog](https://conoroneill.net). I want to write more like that over the next twenty years. 

I might even write another [award winning post](https://conoroneill.com/2007/01/05/you-may-feel-a-small-prick/) when blogging become cool again, around the same time as skinny jeans."
"""2021-03-12T10:17:32+00:00""",Using smashed phones as extra computers at home during the pandemic,"I've always been interested in maximising the lifetime of electronics. I detest built-in obsolescence and I hate the way computers are becoming impossible to upgrade or repair yourself. Apple is the absolute worst culprit in this area and their actions result in others following their terrible example.

Apple's logic is that phones and computers should be like TVs and no-one ever upgrades or repairs their TV. Except, we used to. I still remember the RTV Rentals man coming to our house to replace the tuner in our TV as the existing one couldn't handle the signal of my new ZX Spectrum. 1970s/1980s TVs were modular so it was only a few minutes work. We need to go back to that.

At my most extreme, I recently upgraded the aforementioned 39-year-old ZX Spectrum to have HDMI-out. It has been loading games from SD cards for several years.

![ZX Spectrum](/images/2021/03/spectrum.jpg)


[""Right to repair moves forward for your broken devices. But campaigners want to go much further""](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/right-to-repair-moves-forward-for-your-broken-devices-but-campaigners-want-to-go-much-further/)

I also love using cheap electronics to do powerful things. This is why I adore the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) ecosystems so much. If you can imagine it, you can probably do it with a few Euro and some combination of those plus cheap modules from Aliexpress. Things I have built recently using this approach (and will blog soon) include a cloud-connected CO2 monitor and a cloud-connected oil tank monitor.

Related to this, one challenge I know many families have had during these pandemic lock-downs is access to computers for all their kids. Obviously the easiest solution for many people is to get a great Chromebook for approx €200 but not everyone can afford that.

How many of those people have smashed phones in a drawer that you suspect are still working? 

![Smashed S8](/images/2021/03/smashed.jpg)


I have a completely smashed four year old Samsung Galaxy S8+. Its own screen mostly stays black but sometimes flickers on and off. I dropped it at the start of the Chicago Marathon in 2018 due to the exhaustion of [Aer Lingus's flight from hell](https://conoroneill.com/2018/10/15/flight-ei123-and-the-death-of-the-aer-lingus-brand/). When I got home, I was informed that [a] Vodafone had never applied the phone insurance policy to the S8+ when I had upgraded to it so [b] It would cost €320 to get a new screen. After telling them politely to get fucked (seems to be a recurring thing with me and Vodafone), I promptly bought a cheap new Huawei Honor Play instead. Great phone. The S8+ sat in a drawer until I decided to try this experiment.

I'm pretty sure the vast majority of non-techie people don't realise that any modern smartphone is a supercomputer in their pocket. And, depending on the model, is more that capable of being a desktop replacement for many common tasks. And I don't just mean schoolwork. You could easily build an entire web application or website with this setup.

And it's doable for as little as €35. Let me show you how.

You have two possible approaches depending on the age and capabilities of your phone. 

## Option 1 - A USB-C phone
The easiest way requires a relatively modern Android phone with a USB-C charging connector. That's the one which works either way around. I have successfully tested this with a two-year old Huawei P30 Pro and that smashed Galaxy S8+.

Literally all you need to do is to go to a site like Amazon UK or a store like Currys/PCWorld and buy a few things:

* A USB Mouse
* A USB Keyboard
* A USB-C Hub with HDMI-out
* A HDMI cable (if you don't have a spare)

The cheapest decent Mouse/Keyboard combo I found on Amazon was this [Asus U2000](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075R9TH9H/). It cost me £10.82!! Both keyboard and mouse are shockingly good. In the past I have also bought some no-name wireless keyboard/mouse sets for < £20 on Amazon and they have been pretty rubbish. But wireless is a little bit handier for a lot of people.

The cheapest good suitable USB-C hub I found on Amazon was this [Ablewe 5 in 1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07YWWZJ65/) for £18.99. Again I was really surprised by the quality.

Note that the price of each item comes in under the new Brexity customs and excise limits. If you have (or know someone who has) Amazon Prime, definitely do it as separate free-delivery orders.

TBH that's the hardest bit done.

![Setup](/images/2021/03/setup.jpg)


Assembly is a matter of plugging your phone's charger into the power-in on the hub. Plug the keyboard and mouse into the USB sockets on the hub. Plug the HDMI cable into the HDMI socket on the hub and plug the other end into your TV. Then turn on the phone and plug the hub into its charging port.


Some phones require you to pick an option in the display settings to use the external monitor but most will just immediately mirror their screen to the TV. Huawei phones have a fantastic desktop mode where everything on the TV is in full-screen and you get a Microsoft Windows type user experience. My Samsung S8+ is a bit crappier where all the apps fill the screen, but the main home screen doesn't. A minor annoyance.

![Huawei Desktop](/images/2021/03/huawei.jpg)


Yes, this does involve using your TV if you don't have a spare monitor. But hey, my entire generation learned how to use computers this way!

Right, so you now have a supercomputer with a keyboard, mouse and screen, what can you do? Wait a second, I want to tell you about option 2.

## Option 2 - A micro-USB phone
If you have an older or cheaper Android phone that has a classic micro-USB charger (the type you always try to plug in the wrong way around), you *might* be in luck.

In this case what you need to do is:

* Check if your TV has Google Chromecast built-in
* If it does, you need to test it with your phone before trying anything else. Install [Google Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app&hl=en_IE&gl=US) on your phone and follow the instructions for mirroring your phone on the TV. If it works then skip to the mouse/keyboard purchase instructions below.
* If you don't have Chromecast on the TV but it does have Screen Mirroring or Miracast, check in the settings of your phone whether it also has Screen Mirroring or Miracast. Follow the phone instructions for setting it up.
* If you have neither on your TV, then you can consider buying a Chromecast device. They are [€39 with free delivery in Ireland](https://store.google.com/ie/product/chromecast). But before you do, install Google Home on your phone to confirm that it is compatible (most phones are). Chromecast also lets you display Netflix, RTE Player, YouTube and Eir Sports on your TV via your phone's internet connection.


Now that you have the display piece sorted, you need to get input working. On these phones, you need the following:

* A USB Keyboard and Mouse (see Option 1 above for the details on that)
* A cheap USB Hub [like this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sabrent-4-Port-Individual-Switches-HB-UMLS/dp/B00BWF5U0M/)
* A cheap USB OTG adapter [like this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TECHGEAR-Adapter-Compatible-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B00G1KQE76/)

In this case, plug the keyboard and mouse into the hub and plug the hub into the phone using the OTG adapter. You should be able to use the keyboard and mouse to control the phone now.

The two big drawbacks of this compared to option 1 are the screen mirroring, which can be slow, and the inability to charge the phone whilst you are using it.

Note I've tested this on a cheap <€80 Nokia 2.2 phone and it worked perfectly.

![Nokia 2.2](/images/2021/03/nokia.jpg)


So back to the question, what can I do with this setup? Lots!!

## Using your phone as a computer
The most obvious things you can do with the phone, now that it's connected to a big screen and has decent input devices, are as follows:

* Zoom / Skype / Google Meet / Webex / GotoMeeting / Microsoft Teams. But better, easier.
* Google Docs / Sheets / Drive on a decent sized screen and with keyboard/mouse navigation
* Chrome web browsing in ""Desktop Mode"" so you don't get stuck with mobile versions of sites
* Full GMail and Google Calendar via browser
* Decent YouTube, obvs
* Firefox web browsing in Desktop Mode if you don't like Chrome
* Faster typing etc on general messaging like SMS, Signal, WhatsApp

So basically anything you normally do but a lot easier.

## Online software development
But wait, there's more. An ever increasing number of software development tools and environments are now available in the browser. The days of having to install horrendous monstrosities like Eclipse are going away. This is just a selection for the curious and there are many more.

* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) - This needs to be much better known. It's a really cool online environment for building and re-mixing WebApps and web-sites in your browser.

![Glitch](/images/2021/03/glitch.jpg)

* [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) - I still don't have access to this (pretty please GitHub) but I'm really looking forward to it. Microsoft Visual Studio Code and lots more in the browser. 

* [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) - This is a brilliant way of using JavaScript on low-power devices like Bluetooth badges and watches. If you want to get into the world of IoT, have a look.

![Espruino](/images/2021/03/espruino.jpg)

* [Arduino Online IDE](https://store.arduino.cc/digital/create) - The classic educational IoT platform is now available online too. Arduino is how most people start with IoT and it has a massive ecosystem of hardware and software. But it can be a bit daunting to get started.

* [Microsoft MakeCode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode?rtc=1) - Wow, I only recently discovered this. An online environment for building games, IoT, Lego, Minecraft etc etc. Totally worth a try.

![Make Code](/images/2021/03/makecode.jpg)

## Termux for local development
You want even more? How about a full-blown Linux environment on your phone where you can run Python. Node.js and a ton of other standard software development tools? You can even build and run a web-server on your phone! And interact fully with GitHub etc.

To do this, you need to install [Termux](https://termux.com/). This taps into the underlying Linux kernel on your phone to provide a protected ""old-school"" command line environment. It's crazy good! 

I've even installed youtube-dl using it and downloaded YouTube videos for offline watching on flights (remember flying?).

But this comes with a big warning. Termux is no longer available on the Play Store for technical reasons. You need to use an alternative additional app store called [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/). If you are not comfortable doing that, stop here and just enjoy all the other features I've listed above. If you are comfortable, install from the link above (after enabling ""allow installation of apps from unknown sources"" on your phone).

![Termux](/images/2021/03/termux1.jpg)

You can then run the Termux terminal and install Linux apps using commands like:

```bash
pkg install python
pkg install nodejs
pkg install youtube-dl
pkg install emacs
pkg install nano
pkg install git
```

I won't dig into any more details on that but suffice to say that the classic node.js `hello world` web server can be implemented and run on your phone. Which is mad.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});

```

![Termux 2](/images/2021/03/termux2.jpg)


Or run the legendary text editor, [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), which I first tried on a multi-thousand-dollar Sun Workstation in the 90s.

![Emacs](/images/2021/03/emacs.jpg)

## But but but what about iPhones?
It seems to be possible but I haven't done it. [This adapter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lightening-Adapter-Digital-Converter-Compatible-White/dp/B0872Y1NH2) looks like what you need. It provides HDMI and USB connectors for £25 and can probably be used with a cheap combination wireless keyboard and mouse. 

There is also a Termux type app for iOS called [a-Shell](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438) which lets you run Unix commands on your phone.

Let me know if you try it and it works for you. 


## In closing
I'm not going to claim this is the ideal solution to anything but it's an option for some people and it's also a fun experiment to see what's possible with devices that maybe spend most of their time on Twitter, Snapchat or TikTok.

If you find it useful, if you have any questions, or if you know of other interesting things like this that are possible with phones, let us know."
"""2018-08-10T08:00:00+01:00""",Walking away from Facebook after 11 years.,"I've been meaning to write about giving up on Twitter since last November. I think I'll now wait until I've been off for 12 months.

I kept threatening to walk on Facebook too. I'd like to thank Facebook for killing the List Feed feature today so they made the decision for me. I'm done.

My first two posts on Facebook were in 2006 and 2007. I was complaining about it even then!

![Facebook First Two Posts](/images/2018/08/facebook_first_two_posts.jpg)

For a short while, I really thought Facebook could be something amazing with all of their developer initiatives. But the relentless direction changes which killed many startups soured me completely. For most of the rest of the time, I've only been there for the people who weren't anywhere else. Old friends and family members. But in the past year I've noticed a massive drop off in their presence on Facebook too. So now I'm largely shouting at myself. A bit like this blog :-)

There's not much more to say. You didn't need Facebook before. You certainly don't need it now. Install Signal on your phone, setup some groups and do a lot more interpersonal messaging. Also personal emails never stopped being awesome.

## My last post on Facebook this morning is as follows

The only way I've been able to stomach Facebook for the past many years is with List Feeds. No algorithmic bullshit, just a chronological list of posts by the people/pages I put in the ""Everyone"" List. If someone/thing got too gobby, I just removed them from the list. Simple, with me in complete control.

Facebook is removing that feature today. And with it ends my regular use of Facebook.

2,230,000,000 - 1.

It joins Twitter as something I'll only use when there is no other way of finding out something about an event, or attending it. Or one of you dies. So basically a mix of Eventbrite and rip.ie.

I deleted the apps off my phone many months ago and had only been using the webapps.

I'm still noodling around on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cwjoneill/) (webapp only too) but I'll be mostly going retro and re-focusing on my blogs at [conoroneill.net](https://conoroneill.net) and [conoroneill.com](https://conoroneill.com). I'm just about to go live with my email-to-blog tool for Hugo to make that as easy as possible.

I also tinker a bit with [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@conoro) (not bad, but full of exactly who you'd expect to be there) and [Fritter](dat://fritter.conoroneill.com/) (an experiment not remotely ready for primetime and needs the Beaker browser).

And of course [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/cwjoneill) for the runners/cyclists.

Best way to message me directly is using my mobile number on [Signal](https://signal.org/).

In any case, my small set of followees also anecdotally confirms what FB's recent stats showed - A lot of you have already left or have stopped posting. I'm sure I'll pop back in here every once in a while to watch the increasing tumbleweed and listen to the growing crickets. But in the meantime:

"""2022-09-01T06:00:32+00:00""",Watch your first Ultramarathon online with the Kerry Way Ultra,"## The Kerry Way
Whilst millions of people have completed marathons over the past few decades, ultramarathons are still pretty niche. Ireland has a bunch of fantastic ultrarunners and a handful of amazing ultramarathons. 

The big kahuna of them all is the [Kerry Way Ultra](http://www.kerrywayultra.com/), which is about to have its tenth outing on September 2nd and 3rd. The Kerry Way is a wonderful trail that traverses the entire Iveragh peninsula. Many people travel from the US and mainland Europe to do multi-day hikes of the route.

![Ridge above Waterville](/images/2022/08/kwu_ridge_waterville.jpg)


## KWU Races
Whilst an Ultra is anything over 26.2 miles, it generally starts at 50k and there are some standard distances of 50k, 50 miles, 100k, 100 miles and a few at 200 miles. KWU is a bit different and has 4 races this weekend:

* Lite - ~58k from Sneem to Killarney
* Nite - ~100k from Dromid near Waterville to Killarney.
* Relay - ~200k loop of the entire Kerry Way in teams, start/finish in Killarney
* Full - ~200k loop of the entire Kerry Way as individuals, start/finish in Killarney

![Full Route](/images/2022/08/kwu_route.jpg)

## Eileen
The Race Director, Eileen Daly, is rightly a legend in the Irish ultrarunning community. A former co-worker of mine described her as a force of nature. She has created these very special races that have none of the pomp and hype of other more famous races around the world, but have 100x the heart and the humour.

## 2021 Lite
I did the Lite last year and [it was amazing](https://conoroneill.com/2021/10/03/the-kerry-way-ultra-lite-2021-beyond-words/). It will stay with me forever as a formative experience and was the first time I felt like a proper ultrarunner even though I had run longer distances, if that makes any sense. On top of that, strangely, as I passed the walking dead who were doing the Full, I wasn't dissuaded, they made me want to try it. 

I really can't believe how I have gone from first hearing about KWU maybe 6 years ago and thinking it was for superhuman lunatics, to finding myself getting ready to take it on in less than 24 hours. Yes I'm completely freaked out but luckily I watched [Touching The Void](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtnqVZEktyg) this week, so a wee amble in Kerry over the weekend isn't looking so terrifying any more.

## The Golden Hour
The best ultrarunning podcast out there is [The Adventure Jogger](https://theadventurejogger.com/). Host Ryan Ploeckelman proves time and again that lots of humour mixed with knowledge and insight is the perfect combo for a podcast. 

His [interview with Harvey Lewis](https://soundcloud.com/user-172228713/harvey-lewis-getting-better-with-age) had me laughing out loud like a loon as I tripped relentlessly above Foilmore on one of my KWU recces this summer. 

In another episode, a guest pointed out that in an ultra, spectators only care about the first few people over the line, and the last few people over the line. This was proven in spades last year when Eoghan O'Neill and Denis Bowen crossed the finish line of KWU with 40 seconds to spare. 40! The clip of them finishing was a running highlight of 2021 for me.

## The Full route
You can check out the [Live Tracker](https://live.primaltracking.com/kerrywayultra22/) with the route but you can get an even better sense of it from the 2021 route [on Trace de Trail](https://tracedetrail.fr/en/trace/trace/157243). Particularly the elevation and distance travelled at any point.

## Watching it Live
This year they are trying something new and will have a bunch of live broadcasts online throughout the 40 hours. It'd be fantastic if lots of people who have never looked at a race or an ultra in their lives tuned in for some of it. I think you'll enjoy it!

All the links you need are on [this site](https://live.kerrywayultra.com/) but the main ones are:

* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kerrywayultra/) - Watch out for Stories and Reels
* [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TheKerryWayUltra)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLB6h9qRTza5XFyfNEPb72w)

The outline schedule for broadcasts is as follows:

* Friday 2nd, 5.45am - Ultra Countdown & Kickoff from Killarney Race Course 
* 10am - Glencar 
* 1pm - Glenbeigh 
* 5pm - Waterville 
* 7pm - Caherdaniel 
* 9pm - Waterville, Start of Ultra Nite
* Midnight - Waterville, Burning the midnight oil with some past runners 
* Saturday 3rd, 8am - Sneem, Start of the Ultra Lite 
* 12am - Kenmare 
* 4pm - Killarney Finish Line. Special guest Charles speaking about recovery for athletes
* 7pm - Killarney Finish Line. Special guests speaking about the importance of running for mental health.
* 9pm - Closing ceremony. Special guests who are experts in nutrition for extreme sports

And if you want to follow a very slowly moving dot on a map, my bib number is #147 and the [Live Tracker is here](https://live.primaltracking.com/kerrywayultra22/). Let's see how I do. Particularly when the rain comes in at night."

These are my goto podcasts whilst running slowly, along with [Bad Boys Running](http://www.badboyrunningpodcast.com/), [The Ultra Runner Podcast](http://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/category/podcasts/) and [Adam Buxton](https://soundcloud.com/adam-buxton) (who may not be a runner :-) ).

A few months back Ethan announced The Ginger Runner Virtual Run. On Nov 19th, all entrants had to run for exactly two hours anywhere in the world and upload their GPS trace to Strava. There was lots of swag and a variety of prizes. I just loved the idea of a virtual community all doing the same thing on the same day.

So yesterday I headed out with the car thermometer at 0C and drove to the back of Long Strand. I then spent 2 hours running around Castlefreke Woods, Rathbarry, over to Owenahincha and on to Long Strand itself. It start badly with me wading through 6 inches of water on a flooded trail but I soon warmed up. The rain that followed was not welcome but I didn't mind it at all. And you know what? It was bloody great! I moved at an even slower than my usual sloth pace and took videos and [pictures](https://goo.gl/photos/KjVB9ZhdCyh3pFef8) and talked to a donkey and said hello to lots of walkers and some other runners.

By the end I was tired and wet and smiling from ear to ear.

Since then I have been looking through all of the [pictures, videos, tweets](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23GRVR16%20OR%20%23GRVR&src=typd) and [Facebook comments](https://www.facebook.com/thegingerrunner/?fref=ts) from others who took part. Like many running events, it has every type of runner, from blobs like me to ledgebags like [Jamil Coury](https://twitter.com/MountainOutpost).

Of course this is a commercial endeavour for Ethan, but he deserves every penny he makes from it. He puts enormous effort into his running films and all of the [Ginger Runner media](http://gingerrunner.com/) and it's only fair that those of us who benefit from his work/art should give something back, not just via ad eyeballs and affiliate links.

I hope the success of this encourages people in other fields to do something similar. As I said on Twitter, community is about shared interests, not just physical proximity. For all the brutal flaws of social media, particularly recently, Ethan has shown how it can bring groups of us closer together, even if just for a few damp hours.

PS: I was massively impressed with how quickly the Altra Lone Peak 3.0 drained after I waded through that water. After 5 minutes I'd forgotten I'd been soaking. There was no squelching and my socks were just a bit damp at the end of the run.

PS 2: The [Elephone Explorer Pro](http://conoroneill.com/2016/10/02/timoleague-courtmacsherry-elephone-explorer-pro/) needs a power bank permanently connected to it if you want it to even be powered up for two hours, let alone recording. As you can see, it's pretty poor quality video but probably good enough for me for the moment. I'm mightily tempted by that new Garmin Virb tho."
