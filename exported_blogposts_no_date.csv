10 Years a-bloggin',"Hard to believe. Little did I think, this day 10 years ago, that I'd still be blogging away like fury. I originally started with Blogspot as I wasn't keeping my Geocities home page up to date. It was not an auspicious start:

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/blogger01.png ""blogger01"")](http://conoro.blogspot.com)

And didn't exactly take off like a rocket with only 3 posts in 2001!

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/blogger02-300x292.png ""blogger02"")](http://conoro.blogspot.com)

2005 was the year I really got going when I moved from Blogspot to Wordpress. Luckily I managed to import everything in the move.

Looking across various blogs, it looks like I've written the following in ten years:

*   conoroneill.com: 765 posts
*   argolon.com: 341 posts
*   loudervoice.com: 199 posts
*   web2ireland.org: 288 posts
*   conoroneill.net: 345
*   plus a bunch more scattered amongst random shortlived blogs
Let's call it a nice round 2000 posts. I guess real writers would consider that a reasonable body of work.

Here's hoping I keep it going for another 10 years!

1911 Census full of gems,"[Margaret Jordan](http://twitter.com/margaretjordan) pointed out on Friday in Facebook that the [1911 Census data](http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/) is now online. Ever since, a bunch of us have been searching and learning. I've been looking up O'Neill, ONeill, Neill, Flynn, Meaney, Foley, Doran, Wall and Walls to see which of my ancestors I could identify and send them on to my Mum and Dad.

I was thrilled to find this record of my Granny Mary, her parents and siblings. The first thing that jumped out at me was that my Grandaunt Dora was born Hanora. I wonder when it changed?

[![census](http://photos4.pix.ie/11/B4/11B47FEDB6054A2EB1E59468FCE168BA-500.jpg)](http://pix.ie/conor/1188236 ""census by conor"")

The census covers all 32 countries (obviously) and if you have any interest in history at all, you'll spend hours digging into the data."
2006 - The year of the unsubscription?,"Every year is the ""Year of Something"". In the web world, many are calling 2006 the year of podcasting and I do think it is the year that a big shift in peoples reading/listening habits is happening. I have formulated my theory using a highly scientific principle derived from dianetics called ""my clueless opinion based on a sample size of one"".

Let me explain:

In 1982 I started reading [CAR Magazine](http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/). In 24 years it has gone from being the fount of all motoring knowledge for a young man to being Carsmopolitan with nice purdy pictures of cars. For the first time ever, yesterday I spotted an edition of it and thought ""nah, won't bother"". I've got RSS feeds of [Autoblog ](http://www.autoblog.com/)and [Jalopnik ](http://www.jalopnik.com/)to provide my motoring fix.

In 1984 I started reading [Personal Computer World (PCW)](http://www.pcw.co.uk/). I've missed a couple of editions over 22 years but not many. I gave up in March. A couple of good tech blogs plus a few RSS feeds for the main tech sites has made it irrelevant despite continuing to be a fine publication.

In 1997 I started reading [Slashdot ](http://slashdot.org/)as my first web-site of the day. Last year I switched to the RSS feed. Lat month I unsubscribed. It is no longer compelling in the face of thousands of specialist sites and blogs that cover the same topics with more depth and without teenage script kiddies adding noise.

In 1996 I started reading [Salon ](http://www.salon.com/)as my second web-site of the day. When they went premium, so did I. Despite all their financial problems it was one of the best sites on the web for years. The articles were witty, intelligent, informative and challenging. And then Bush won the first time. Bit by bit the hysteria grew and the interest diminished. When he won the second time, they completely lost the plot. They became a haven for whacko conspiracy theories and all the while they couldn't see that they were screeching to the converted. They now publish nothing that cannot be replaced by a few decent entertainment and political blogs. I won't be re-subscribing.

I gave up on the paper version of the [Irish Times](http://www.ireland.com/) years ago. I cannot believe there in no-one in the Irish media with a few bob and some vision who couldn't blow ireland.com out of the water with some high-quality, non-happy-clappy-tree-huggy-gosh-were-so-smart-americans-are-so-dumb journalism. Anyone? There are some excellent Irish blogs covering politics but very few really covering a wide range of current affairs who aren't secretly hoping to get a job eventually with The IT.

I've been listening to the radio for as long as I can remember the farming programme being on during my tea. I just did a search on ""Chenoumption, quare name but great stuff"" to discover after all these years that it was ""Cheno Unction"" (a barrier ointment for use on lesions on cow's teats if you must know). I now listen to live radio for maybe 30 minutes a week. When your interests are tech, food and comedy, Irish radio only intermittently meets your needs. I now just listen to a bunch of great US podcasts, [PhantomFM](http://www.phantomfm.com/now/podcasts.htm), [Gift Grub](http://www.todayfm.com/article.asp?id=16682), [Winter Food](http://www.rte.ie/radio1/winterfood/), a few Irish podcasts and a wee bit of [Ricky Gervais](http://www.rickygervais.com/) instead.

TV has escaped because of the format - 32"" on the diagonal beats 2""x2""any day (as the bishop...). But with Sky+ I almost never watch it as it was scheduled and ads are all at 30x speed.

So there you have it: 190 RSS feeds in Bloglines, 25 podcast feeds in Juice, a bit of telly and everything else can shag off with itself.

Or maybe it's just me?

2017 - The year of running 1000 miles,"2017 was probably the year I stopped feeling odd when calling myself a runner. I achieved a bunch of new things in running, including my first 50k, and managed to do just over 1000 miles for the year.

## Start running now

If you are thinking of taking up running in the new year, go for it. No excuses. Forget about ""I'll wait until I've lost some weight"" or ""when the weather improves"" or ""my knee is a bit twingey"". Go to a running shop now, buy a pair of runners in the new year sales along with a running top, running shorts and socks and you're ready (or just wear some sweatpants and a t-shirt). If money is tight, check out all of the cheap own-brand Kalenji gear on [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.ie/) or sales on [Wiggle](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/)/[SportsShoes](https://www.sportsshoes.com/)/[SportsPursuit](https://www.sportpursuit.com/).

Then start running.

If running alone bothers you, find a local [parkRun](http://www.parkrun.ie/) and get out every Saturday morning. Or see if there is a [Fit4life club](http://www.athleticsireland.ie/clubs/fit4life/find-a-fit4life-club) in your area.

Hopefully my 2017 stats will give you some encouragement. Well maybe not the speed aspect :-) Everything below was done whilst weighing north of 220lbs, 5ft 10ish and aged 48/49. So not [Eliud Kipchoge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2ZLG-Fij_4) or [Kilian Jornet](https://youtu.be/gGf3p6ZvRI4?t=55).

## How I ran

* Treadmill 314.13 KM / 195.19 Miles
* Road 841.273 KM / 522.74 Miles

* Hoka One One Clifton - Love these. Fabulous cushion. A bit heavy. Narrow but ok. Great for very long distances.
* Inov-8 X-CLAW 275 - Love these. Perfect for boggy muddy Irish off-road running.
* Altra Paradigm 1.5 - Like these. Old. Treadmill only. Great cushion. Terrible heel cup.
* Altra Lone Peak 3.0 - Like these. Medium cushion. Good for forest paths and some road. Useless in full-on Irish mud.

## Weight Loss

7 lbs :-(

## Aims for 2018

I have a few things I want to achieve in 2018

* Run almost every day
* Run a lot more off-road
* Get good at running up and down mountains/hills
* Lose an enormous amount of weight
* Complete my first 50 mile Ultra
* Do the Chicago Marathon

## How to approach 2018

220 Children to get Chest X-Rays,"due to the TB outbreak in Cork. 

> Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs. But, TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal. TB disease was once the leading cause of death in the United States.
> 
> TB is spread through the air from one person to another. The bacteria are put into the air when a person with active TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs or sneezes. People nearby may breathe in these bacteria and become infected.

Current waiting list for BCG in Cork - 5 to 6 months!

HSE, get up off your asses, get all the BCG shots in Ireland down here NOW, advertise it everywhere and get the children of every copped-on parent vaccinated asap!

Or do we have to wait until the first child dies from complications when they go from latent to active?

UPDATE 1; Good thread [here on MagicMum](http://www.magicmum.com/phpBB/cork-girls-bcg-vaccine-t57102.html). Like almost everyone else we didn't get our youngest 3 done in Cork as it was not offered and we cluelessly did what we were told. Seriously regretting that now and signed up in a six month queue. Maybe a trip to Limerick is in order?"
3G Doctor Signals the Return of House Visits,"I don't normally mention posts that I write on [blognation](http://ie.blognation.com/) over here but I think this one is probably of great interest to many of my local readers and those in more rural locations in Ireland and the UK.

A company called 3G Doctor in Kerry provides a service whereby you can get a video consultantion with a qualified doctor using your 3G phone. 

I've written [all about it here](http://ie.blognation.com/2007/11/07/3g-doctor-signals-the-return-of-house-visits/). I'd be interested to hear what you think and whether the 3G coverage is good enough yet so that it is useful to the people who need it most. 

For those who think 3G phones are outside their budget, the fabulous Sony Ericsson K800i is little more than €100 on pay monthly upgrade. That's barely two visits to the doctor."
4-2 to the Boys,"Well the wee fetus has turned out to be a boy. We had the 21-week scan yesterday and even I could tell it was a bloke! He is slightly above average weight and all looks perfect. A couple of scans will be posted soon (including a High-5 which is pretty neat). Ois and Osc are thrilled ""So that'll be 4 boys and only 2 girls in the house. Brilliant!"". Names we have come up with so far to annoy my mother include Cavan, Mossie, Moses and Cruz."

6 Years of Electronic Engineering,"I bought my first soldering iron and multimeter by mail-order from Maplin when I was about 16 (1984) to build some add-ons for my ZX Spectrum. None of my creations ever worked :-(

I still have the soldering iron. I finally retired the analogue multimeter only last week after 21 years of sterling service and replaced it with a no-name digital one that I picked up in B&Q for &euro;25.

I spent 6 years in UCD studying Electronic Engineering. In that time, I didn't make one useful thing. I know, I know, they weren't teaching me how to solder, they were giving me the skills I needed so I could get someone else to do it ;-)

Every once in a while I get the urge to put some wee electronic kit together, but I never make the time available.

90-L-1944 attempted to murder my family today ,"The savage at the wheel of 90-L-1944 came within a hair's breadth of killing me, all my children, my mother in law, all of those in an oncoming vehicle and everyone in his own vehicle 10 minutes ago.

This cretin who clearly rates his own life as worthless carried out a suicidal overtaking manouvre of my car just before Bandon with a stream of cars bearing down on us. If I hadn't seen him in my side mirror and swerved into the road margin at the last second, there would have been a fatal three car collision.

This imbecile then immediately got stuck in 20 MPH town traffic.

If you spot this old grey Honda Prelude in West Cork, give it a wide berth, he may try to kill you too.

You may ask why I didn't call the police. Do you think they would have done anything?"
A fine day out at the Bandon Show,"We had a blast of an afternoon at the Bandon Show yesterday. Everything from horses to bulls to dogs were on show and there were plenty of activities for the young uns too. We ran into a ton of people we knew.

I explained to Oisín that this was the starting point in the supply chain for all dairy products. He was suitably impressed.

Some very confused looking Llamas. I thought of my Grandad when I saw these and wondered what he would think if he was alive. Something along the lines of ""has the world gone copmpletely mad?"".

I thought of this weeks episode of the Soprano's when I saw this. The fact that Bandon is doing the procession of the eucharist thing today really drove home the Bandon - New Jersey similarities! The only thing we are missing is Paulie.

A free way for your kids to learn web/games programming in Cork City and County,"A few months back I mentioned [Coder Dojo](http://coderdojo.com/) which now covers the country and has recently gone international. It's a free programming club where kids go with their parents and learn about things like web development, mobile development, games programming or other types of coding. The Cork City one is jammers every week from what I hear.

I was thrilled to see that Kinsale has kicked one off too and they had 103 kids at their first one. Well done!

Annnd I've just spotted that they now have one on Sundays in Blackrock Observatory.

If you are anywhere even vaguely close to either club I would encourage you to go with your children. I am absolutely convinced that early exposure to ""computers"" in a creative setting (not as consumers reading web pages or playing games) gives children a swathe of new opportunities in life that they would otherwise miss out on. They may never be programmers but they may become designers, engineers, scientists or artists.

This is also absolutely not a thing only for middle class, technical parents. The clubs have plenty of spare computers and people there who can help/guide the kids. You just have to be there to mind them :-)

The contact details for the City one [are here](http://coderdojo.com/dojos/cork/). It is on every Saturday morning in the NSC in Mahon.

Kinsale [details here](http://coderdojo.com/dojos/kinsale/).

The Kinsale one is on this evening at 7pm in The Trident Hotel. Please contact them if you are intending to go so they have an idea of numbers. They use an SMS system to gauge numbers each week where you just send Y/N in reply to a text message.

Blackrock [details here](http://coderdojo.com/dojos/cork-blackrock-castle-observatory/).

## Munster Programming Training

I should also mention the granddaddy of them all, the brilliant Munster Programming Training course which has been going for many years in UCC.

A Kitchen Paradise in Bantry,"We recently discovered this shop as it seems to be the only one in a few hundred miles of Bandon that sells Sodastream gas refills. Catherine popped down a few weeks ago to get two refills and raved about the place. I drove down yesterday to have a look and get some of the Sodastream flavours.

They are just at the top of town on the main street, impossible to miss. I went in with 4 of our monsters so couldn't spend as much time as I'd like. Suffice to say, if you like cookware or kitchenware, you'll adore this shop. It is jammed with tons and tons of everything you could possibly need in a kitchen. In just a few minutes I got my Sodastream flavours (highly recommend that you start using this 1970s classic again to save yourself a fortune. Also less damaging to the environment!), spatula, pouring nozzles for oil, bun cases and oven thermometer. The owners were extremely friendly and helpful too.

The highlight for us all was this coffee maker. Slightly out of our budget but a wonderful design.

The Cookware Company is worth a drive no matter where you are in Cork."
A perfect Hideaway,"Christine and Dermot Gannon have created a flawless hideaway experience in the Tipperary countryside. Our short one night stay turned out to be one of my most enjoyable travel experiences ever.

My lovely mother-in-law Mary got myself and Catherine a night away in The Old Convent as a present last Christmas. It came very highly recommended by her sister-in-law Marie whose standards are very high. We headed off from Bandon mid-afternoon on a Friday and arrived little more than an hour later in Clogheen. On the way we finally passed through the legendary Ballyporeen with its Ronald Regan Visitor Centre.

[![31052008025](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2389/2540910131_176a04b0ee.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2540910131/ ""31052008025 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

The Convent itself is a gorgeous old tall building on the edge of Clogheen village in a beautiful garden. For some reason I was expecting a stern no-nonsense farmer's wife to greet us. I couldn't have been further off the mark. Christine is an absolutely lovely young American who knows exactly how to put you are your ease.

[![30052008012](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/2541690260_dfca0127fc.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2541690260/ ""30052008012 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

The whole setup of the operation is just perfect; we both kept saying ""isn't that just brilliant"" as we'd discover another little touch in the room or restaurant. In particular I love the way they make it possible for you to be sociable with the lounge etc but they don't push it on you. As two totally anti-social people when we are taking a break, we chose not to mingle.

The room was fantastic. I can't really say much else about it. Comfy, massive bathroom, big settee and bravely, no TV. I applaud them for doing that. They have a TV in the lounge if you are desperate to see Nationwide.

The room was compelemented by a completely genius idea. They have a kitchen on the first floor too. It's stuffed with lots of teas, coffees, chocolates, various bits and bobs you might run out of and loads of cookery books. C'mon, this is one of the smartest things I've ever seen in a BandB.

We headed down for dinner at 8pm and the place was soon hopping. Remember, this is basically in the middle of nowhere but can fill its dining room on a Saturday night. By our estimate, there were 3-4 other couples staying so the rest had travelled for the food. Compare that to a certain place in Ranelagh! They have a very striking white and purple motif running through the entire place which we both loved. Some nod to its religious background? The high ceilings and downstairs windows remind you of its previous function.

The meal was very impressive in every way. Not Michelin level but better for it. Fantastic flavours, interesting combinations and not a clunker in the set. The way they do it is unusual too. Everyone gets the tasting menu and they roll out the food to lots of tables at the same time. I know that sounds odd but it works and the food didn't suffer.

A big room of diners was serviced by three staff and somehow it worked marvellously. At no point were we left waiting for anything. The staff were friendly, confident and fun.

The meal was as follows:

*   Lobster Martini - This had sushi rice, wasabi, lobster, pineapple pickle, Ardsallagh whip and candied pistachios. All the flavours worked beautifully together, but I think I'd have preferred it to be smaller with less of the rice.

[![30052008016](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2094/2541694708_32867637aa.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2541694708/ ""30052008016 by bandon1, on Flickr"")*   Cherry Tomato Veloute - Oh god, I'd have licked the cup clean given half a chance

[![30052008017](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3082/2541696766_060e068000.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2541696766/ ""30052008017 by bandon1, on Flickr"")*   Pastis Steamed Halibut in sweet and sour duck broth with duck wonton - For some reason this didn't read well on the page but wow it delivered on the plate. Who knew halibut and duck go so well together? I think this was the highlight for Catherine.

[![30052008018](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2541700452_39a0aa7dbb.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2541700452/ ""30052008018 by bandon1, on Flickr"")*   Blackcurrant Sorbet with passionfruit jelly - Yum yum yum.

[![30052008019](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2407/2541704576_a316cc87eb.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2541704576/ ""30052008019 by bandon1, on Flickr"")*   Seared veal fillet with braised shoulder, mushroom and pea fricassee, pecan and raisin gnocchi. Another beautiful medley of flavours that just hangs together so well. Only tiny criticism was that I expected the veal to be a bit pinker.
*   Raspberry and White Chocolate Tiramisu - Not much to say except there was none left when I was done
*   Chocolate Fondue  - Stroke of genius. A bowl of melting chocolate, fondue prongs and lots of fruit to dip. We couldn't stop eating this despite being totally full.
*   Cupcakes and Coffee - I was honestly so full I could only fit the coffee but the mini-cupcakes looked lovely
And now for the clincher - guess how much the meal was per head? €60! If you live anywhere within an hour's drive of there, book a meal now. This is amazing value for such high-end cooking. My only overall criticism of the meal was that it was too big. They could wind-back some of the portion sizes.

We had two wines with the meal; a Sancerre and a Reisling. Both lovely, both great value.

Off to bed we went and obeyed the stern ;-) rules on the room door which insisted on us sleeping-in and not having breakfast until 9am at the earliest! Oh, in keeping with the emphasis on relaxing there is sod all mobile signal (and no 3G).

And the breakfast, oh my god. I won't go through the detail, I'll just paste a photo of the menu below. I had the skillet eggs. A perfect plate of food, just perfect.

We left shortly afterwards on a beautiful Saturday morning.

I cannot come up with enough superlatives to describe The Old Convent. They have clearly thought through every single detail of their offering and I'm just in awe of them. They are the gold standard to which every other similar operation should aspire.

A round-up of Conor's recent races. Lots to recommend!,"I've been having fun mixing up the length and style of the races we've run this Summer and Autumn. Whilst my speed remains atrocious, I find that my recovery time is getting shorter and shorter, which must be a sign of something. So here goes, June to September:

## Cork City Marathon
What can I say? It broke me again. I started so well - faster than last year and feeling strong. But yet again, as soon as I got to Mahon, I began to overheat and all the energy left my legs. I never got my mojo back but at least this time I had a strong sprint up Pana and felt totally fine afterwards. Mocko's win put a huge smile on my face.

I also have to mention the woman in Togher. She was standing there with bags of Haribo. I asked her if she'd been there last year too, as the Haribo had saved me then. She replied ""I'm always here"". I honestly nearly broke down in front of her. Thank you again.

## Ballyheigue Half on the Head
This was one of our last minute decisions. We tootled down to Ballyheigue for the first time ever to discover it's a lovely place. There was a big turn-out for both the [Half and the 10k](http://ballyheigue.ie/wordpress/half-on-the-head/). It was relentless hills but I loved it. Most of the views were great but there were a couple that stopped me in my tracks, they were so stunning. Definitely one that's worth the drive.

## Timoleague to Courtmacsherry 10k
It's ridiculous that this was only my second ever time to run this race, as it's only 20 minutes down the road. The previous time was my first ever race back in 2010 and that nearly killed me. It's one of the flattest 10k's in Ireland and I do a lot of my training runs here. For whatever reason I haven't been able to beat my 10k PR that I got on the hilly Bandon 10k back in 2013. Finally I did it down in Courtmac. I bloody loved this race. It's very rare for me to pass anyone unless they are walking but I powered through the last 3km and passed a bunch. I'll be back next year to chop another few minutes off.

## Clonakilty 10 Miler
This is a small local race that should get more attention. I thought it was just spot-on last year and was looking forward to this year. Of course I had a wee bit too much wine the night before and had a harder race than was necessary. I came in as the final man. I was really pleased to see some Fit4Life people, who brought up the rear last year, kick my ass this year. A bad reflection on me but a great progression for them.

## East Cork Harbour Marathon
[This one](http://eastcorkmarathon.com/) had us worried. All of the reports last year talked about the hills and the driving rain. But what the hell, we wanted to bang out another marathon. 

It was much smaller than I expected with only 113 entries in the Full. I had a funny chat with a guy from the UK who thought he had entered the Cork City Marathon. He was a bit shocked by the tiny rural start-line! The first half of the race was fabulous. I had no idea how gorgeous it is in that part of East Cork. I thought it was all ESB power station and oil refinery. But that road along the inlet from Aghada is spectacular. 

However this was followed by a few miles on the main road which was horrible. Cars whizzing by at high speed, thinking that beeping is helpful rather than terrifying. Then we headed into the back-road hills which were awful. I walked a huge part of this section. The final section from Whitegate on the main road was at least mostly on footpath. 

I was shocked to learn that there were 13 people behind me, given my pace. 

TBH, I don't see myself doing this race again, I just didn't enjoy it overall. But a route that was entirely along the water would get me back.

## Chiltern Challenge 50k
See [my blogpost here](https://conoroneill.com/2017/07/23/the-chiltern-challenge-50k-conors-first-ultra-marathon/). A life highlight.

## MMRA Glen of Aherlow LoopDeLoop ""Ultra""
Yeah, this one was interesting :-) We signed up for the Ultra on the [IMRA site](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1506) despite it being rated 10/10 for difficulty. My wife asked someone she knows about it and he said ""yeah it has a few hills but it's fine"". The description was forest paths and coutry roads. As it was 3 Half Marathon loops, I wasn't worried about it. After any loop we could just give up. Two weeks beforehand they published the cut-off for starting the third loop - 5 hrs 20 mins. So we knew going in that there was zero chance of us doing the Ultra. A Full would be the best we could hope for with 2000 feet of elevation change per loop.

![Glen of Aherlow](/images/2017/10/2017-09-24 13.53.39.jpg)

As I'm only just getting into trails this year, I've never done any of the Galtees runs. This was only the second time ever to be in the area. The Bandon Hillwaking Club Open Day earlier this year was the first. 

It was an early start at 8am outside the village hall of Lisvarrinane. 15 people were signed up for the Ultra with a lot more coming later for the official Full and official Half. But the nice thing was that we'd get a Full or Half time in the Ultra if we DNFed at the end of a loop.

The terrain was a lot rougher than expected but exactly what I've discovered I enjoy. Unfortunately my wife fell shortly after the start and got cut up. After a few miles she realised she'd be DNFing after one loop.

The very steep start was fine but the relentless mud and water and river-bed terrain made it extremely difficult to get any speed going. Once it switched to big forest tracks and a tiny bit of road, we were able to speed up. But my knee had been giving me gyp for weeks and really started complaining.

We were shocked to get to the end of the first loop and discover it had taken us 3.5hrs!! For a damned Half Marathon!! The RDs recommended that we DNF and had no argument from us. Later we checked the results and only 8 people finished the Ultra. But jesus christ the times of the finishers. I'm still in shock. The winner did it in 5hrs 22mins. I can't run that fast on the flat and they did it on that hilly mud-bath.

Buuuuuuut, I kinda loved it. So the following weekend I went back on my own. This time with poles and the route on my phone. I was chuffed to rip 30 minutes out of the previous time. But that's still not fast enough for the Ultra cut-off!

Side-note: I used the Lidl hiking poles that they were selling recently. I like the way they collapse down and they felt strong and light due to some use of carbon fibre. They worked very well over the 13 miles. However the handles are rough with too many injection moulding marks etc. I ended up with blisters on both thumbs. I'm going to wrap them in some sort of tape and try them again. But a total bargain.

If you want to try out the route, here's [the Strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/1186192545). You can load the GPX file into your Garmin watch or something like [RunGo](https://www.rungoapp.com/) on your phone. The views on a clear day are fantastic. But you will get very very dirty :-)

So the plan for the next few months is a huge increase in my hill-work. I'm happy with my ability to run downhill and run on ""gnarly"" terrain with poles. But I clearly have huge work to do on the uphills. 

## Next?
Neither of us were in the mood on Sunday so we bailed on the Cork-to-Cobh. There's a few MCI runs coming up that we're looking at. Then it's NYC baby! 

Last year I stunned myself by doing 5 marathons. If we finally do the Clonakilty Marathon (after years of Halves and 10Ks), then that's likely to be 7 for the year. I thought we might get to 10 but I'm enjoying the current mix. Generally I much prefer the trails to the road but that'll probably mean going abroad a lot more if I want to regularly do the very long stuff.

## Important Note
I want to do a big shout out to everyone who volunteers in these races, from the 5k's to the Ultras. I've never done it and I need to change that. I always make a point of thanking people at every aid-station in every race. Even with screw-ups like the water in Brighton, you should never take it out on the people who have given up their day to make yours better. I particularly want to thank anyone who has volunteered at an Ultra or who is an RD at a community event like all the MCI and IMRA/MMRA races and parkRuns too. It really is appreciated."

What [John Handelaar has done](http://handelaar.org/blog/2009/04/a-substantial-announcement) over at [kildarestreet.com](http://handelaar.org/blog/2009/04/a-substantial-announcement) with the help of some other great people is deeply important. Quite simply, the Dáil record is now properly accessible rather than just available. The site enables you to do the following:

*   Read a dramatically-more-legible version of the Dáil Record going back to January 2004
*   Search that record by speeches or written questions, or by speaker, or by date or date range
*   Sign up for email alerts for when a search query you're interested changes
*   Sign up for email alerts whenever a TD of your choosing says something or asks a question which generated a written reply
*   Subscribe to RSS feeds for individual TDs or for search queries
This isn't just important for the content you find but also for the content that you don't find. I will not be voting for any sitting TD in any future election unless I see continuous active engagement by them in the Dáil. If they don't have anything to say, they shouldn't be there.

The days of some gobshite getting elected because he got your daughter a job in the Civil Service or claims to be responsible for every penny spent in your constituency have to come to an end. [kildarestreet.com](http://kildarestreet.com/) will hopefully help usher the beginning of proper national politics involving those who care about our _country_ and what it can become.

We all sat idly by as those running this country ran it into the ground. It's time we started paying attention.

UPDATE:

I just used the site to check on our three TDs in Cork South-West. Summary as follows for the past year:

*   Christy O'Sullivan (FF): Has spoken in 5 debates in the last year — well below average among TDs. Has received answers to 8 written questions in the last year — below average among TDs
*   PJ Sheehan (FG): Has spoken in 81 debates in the last year — above average among TDs. Has received answers to 101 written questions in the last year — average among TDs.
*   Jim O'Keeffe (FG): Has spoken in 51 debates in the last year — average among TDs. Has received answers to 173 written questions in the last year — above average among TDs.

After seeing this, I take back any ageist comments I made in the last election about PJ Sheehan and I'm disappointed to see my predictions about Christy O'Sullivan have proven true."

A year of running updates,"As has been the case so often over the past 15 years of blogging, I've been very remiss in my updates. I've had a ton of things I want to write about, like the Waterford Greenway and how adventure/outdoor tourism could be a much bigger business here. But that's for my holidays.

Today, as I move this blog to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/]) (what a journey it has had!), I thought I'd just give an update on my running. The last time I mentioned it, I had [just finished the London Marathon](http://conoroneill.com/2015/05/03/this-heavy-guy-decided-to-run-the-london-marathon-and-you-won-t-believe-what-happened-next/). Still a life highlight for me.

The rest of 2015 was quiet from a ""race"" perspective. I signed up for the [Dingle Marathon](http://www.dinglemarathon.ie/) and then chickened out and did the Half. Very glad I did, as I'd forgotten what a tough course it is. But it is still one of the greatest routes anywhere on the planet. Even the Top Gear guys agree.

The [Clon Half](http://runclon.ie/) was delayed due to the flooding, so basically I spent most of 2015 doing short runs around the town and on the treadmill and making no impact on my weight.

So January 1st lands and we decide to really push it. We signed up for the [Greater Manchester Marathon](http://www.greatermanchestermarathon.com/) in April and kicked off training. Things went well and I particularly enjoyed my 18 mile loop from the train station in Cork out to Ballincollig and back. It beats running 3 times around Bandon!

The Clon Half was re-scheduled for February and that was as tough as ever, with the added feature of horizontal driving rain. A terribly slow time but it was fine overall.

Then on to Manchester with 3 of us heading over. The race itself was very flat but also suburban boring. I found it tough mentally but physically I was fine and I did a sprint finish. The non-alcoholic Erdinger at the finish line was a lovely touch. The multi-hour disaster of bag pickup didn't affect me but left a sour taste in everyone's mouths. The fact that I could walk up stairs that evening told me I really hadn't pushed it at all.

Having done the Cork Half a few years ago, it seemed ridiculous that we hadn't done the full [Cork Marathon](http://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/). So we then signed up to run that in June. A few weeks into training and again it was time for the long run. And again the thought of 3 times around Bandon filled us with dread. So, what the hell, we decided to do the [Lakes Of Killarney Marathon](http://killarneymarathonofthelakes.com/). It's a small event with 3 loops of the National Park. The views were incredible. The day was boiling hot. I didn't feel great. The first loop was OK but up/down hard. Mentally I was in a baddddd place. Half way round the second loop I decided I was going to quit. So I kept going to the checkpoint, crossed the timing mat and started heading towards the barriers to leave. And then, the tannoy boomed ""And here's Conor O'Neill, about to start his third loop."". Nooooooooooo. The only force more effective than exhaustion is shame and embarrassment for an Irish person. So I kept going for another 9 miles. Pure bloody torture. I finished 3rd last. And as always, the moment I crossed the finish line I thought ""ah that was fine really"".

So we get to Cork. The third marathon in 8 weeks. What the hell are we at? I thought I'd only ever do one marathon! But I was feeling good. The cumulative effect of the training seemed to be helping. No injuries. 1.5 stone lighter than Jan 1st. But still crazily overweight. The race kicked off on Patrick Street. Within a few minutes, my friend Walter appeared and we had a good natter out towards Blackpool and then on towards the tunnel. But, despite his injury, there is no way he could run as slowly as me, so he headed off into the distance.

I've been experimenting with audio for runs. On short ones, I use nothing. For long ones, I've been using podcasts for many years. Often running podcasts too, to be very meta. But I've come to the conclusion that [a] I run slower when they are playing and [b] I find it hard to concentrate and overcome pain/tiredness/etc when they are playing. So for Cork I listened to a random ""dance workout mix"". And it bloody worked. Despite physically finding Cork gruelling, I was in a great place mentally for the entire thing. But the hills, jesus how did I forget the relentless goddammed hills? As expected, Model Farm was the absolute nadir. My feet barely moved.

Sidebar: I've been on various running forums and [/r/running](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/) on Reddit recently and I listen to quite a few running/ultra podcasts. And I've noticed a tendency for some people there to belittle very slow runners or runner/walkers. My guess is that these are mostly people in their 20s/early-30s at peak fitness who have yet to learn the real meaning of the word empathy. As their bodies age, they may start to understand. During the Cork Marathon, I passed a woman going even slower than me up Model Farm Road. As I approached, I realised from her back-bib that she was running the Half. Yes, this woman was on hour five of a Half Marathon. That's gumption. That's depth of character. That's someone to look up to, rather than snarking about their age/weight/training. So the next time you see someone shuffling slowly along in their runners, do what someone did to me today as I jogged towards the [Fuschia Trail on Seven Heads](http://explorewestcork.ie/walking/seven-heads-walk/). Shout ""Fair play to you"".

I finished Cork completely drained. That's the shakiest I've ever been at the end of my six Marathons. I think it was the heat and possibly screwing up hydration. It took me over a week to feel in any way right. 10 days before I even got on the treadmill. 3 marathons in 8 weeks was maybe a bit much for someone this heavy. But I'm so glad I did them.

The last three small runs were all in the past two weeks. I was in San Francisco at Red Hat Summit and did a 7 mile loop from Crissy Fields over the Golden Gate and back. Loved every minute of it and had perfect weather to take amazing photos. Then we had the Red Hat 5K Fun Run from Moscone to Embarcadero and back. I think that gave me a 5K PB, despite all the traffic lights! And then finally today I ran from Timoleague to Courtmacsherry and round the first short loop of the Seven Heads and back to Timoleague. I can't recommend this route highly enough. You don't need trail runners for the Seven Heads piece but it is hard on the ankles. The plan is to try some of the longer loops soon.

So next up? Well we're booked for Berlin and that's going to be a PB for me if it kills me. I think we have to do Dublin too, given the year that's in it. But to break up the training boredom we'll probably do a Full and a Half in August. All recommendations welcome. Not too far from Cork tho. Finally, I'll probably just do the Half in Clon in December.

And the planning has begun for an Ultra. Hopefully 2017. Hopefully I'll be 50lbs lighter. I'll probably start with a 50K to dip the toe in and then I'm sure I'll be leading the pack at [UTMB](http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/) in 2018 ;-)"
Acknowledging the achievement of Carol Morgan in The Spine Race,"I first learned of the [Montane Spine Race](http://thespinerace.com/) last year when there were some mentions online of an Irish guy winning some insanely long race and breaking the record. This turned out to be [Eoin Keith](https://eoinkeith.wordpress.com/) who is an amazing ultra runner. He had to pull out this year in third position after breaking a rib near the start. He waited 170 miles to do so :-)

Yup, the Spine Race is 268 miles along the Pennines in the UK. Only the toughest of the tough get to the end. The more I watched [the coverage](https://www.facebook.com/TheSpineRace/) last week, the more my admiration grew. These are a special breed of people who want to push themselves to extremes of physical and mental exhaustion.

Which brings us to [Carol Morgan](http://www.grough.co.uk/magazine/2017/01/20/carol-morgan-smashes-record-by-43-hours-to-take-womens-title-in-spine-race). She is an Irish nurse working in Leeds who has already finished world famous ultras like [UTMB](http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/). Carol went out last week and finished as the first woman. This is already an huge achievement for any human. Then you realise she was joint 6th *overall*. Then you learn that she beat the previous record by 43 hours! Finally you realise she finished a day ahead of the second placed woman.

![Carol's Time](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/spine_race_carol_morgan.jpg)

This is just a spectacular sporting achievement and everyone in the country should be talking about it just as much as any Olympic medallist. But we know they won't because that's not how mainstream media works.

[<img src=""https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The-Spine-2017-White-Hill-Carol-Morgan-1024x682.jpg"">](http://www.grough.co.uk/magazine/2017/01/20/carol-morgan-smashes-record-by-43-hours-to-take-womens-title-in-spine-race)

&nbsp;

Carol appears to be a very private person who declined to have any video footage taken of her competing in the race. But I just wanted to say that her win last week is genuinely inspirational for me. I've never run more than 26.2 miles and I've never run more than 15 miles off road. I don't know if I'll ever try to do 268 miles, but if I do, it'll be because of people like Carol and Eoin.

It strikes me that Irish people are particularly suited to Ultra running due to the fact that we are all stubborn feckers. I think we're going to see a major uptick in this area in Ireland in the next few years. Far beyond Adventure races, Tris and traditional XC. The mix of run-walk that many competitors  do over these very long distances is much more manageable for a wider range of people. And it doesn't need to cost anything beyond some runners, wet gear, a compass and a map (I know I know, there's more to it than that).

Now to find my first trail 50k. In the meantime, I might see some of you at the [IMRA](https://www.imra.ie/events/) 5 miler [in Castlefreke](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1477) on February 5th?

The best aspect of his performance was that he decided to keep his thighs covered, a decision I wish many of the other performers had also made.

Now Eurovision, later Big Brother. Would they not think of merging the two programmes and put all the bands into a small sealed house with some guns and knives. Last (wo)man standing and still singing is the winner. I can only dream.

UPDATE 1: I take it all back, Finland to win! The Albanian hobbits must surely be hiding from the ""never smalltalk a Finn"" Orcs. Next year they'll all be dressed like that.

Alex Honnold free solo 360 video - Mind-blowing in Google Cardboard,"If you don't have a [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/), you can still get some sense of the scale of what Alex Honnold achieved this year when he free soloed [El Capitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan) in Yosemite if you use the 3D controls in YouTube.

Free Soloing is climbing without any equipment or safety ropes. What Alex did is one of the greatest sporting achievements by a human ever.

{{< youtube FRGF77fBAeM >}}

I've no massive interest in climbing but after watching the Valley Uprising documentary last night (available to buy or watch or Netflix), I have a whole new appreciation for the mindset and philosophy of people like Honnold and [John Bachar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bachar) before him.

I'm also hoping to see [The Dawn Wall](http://www.dawnwall-film.com/) when we're in the US soon."
All my current running technology,"The only thing you need to run is a pair of running shoes. And some people even get by without those. This is regularly driven home to me by the guy in his GAA top/shorts and knackered shoes who laps me in parkRun.

But if you read this blog you're probably a geek like me and of course I'm riddled with tech when I go for a lot of my runs. So this is my current ERC (Every Run Carry). I treat things like running bottles exactly the same way I treat my Garmin, they are both tech.

## Running Shoes / Runners
I have three main pairs at the moment.

### Altra Paradigm 1.5
The [Paradigm](https://www.altrarunning.com/men/paradigm-20) has been my main pair of shoes (along with the 1.0) since June 2015. Zero drop with incredible cushioning and extremely wide toe-box. Your feet will be immaculate after 26.2 miles. But the heel design is completely useless. They don't lock your heel at all and the inner material wears away after a few weeks. Also see my comment on the Skechers below. The weight of the Paradigms is really obvious to me now. But if you are of heavier build and want tons of sole between you and the road, there's nothing better.

![Paradigm](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/paradigm.jpg)

### Altra Lone Peak 3.0
See [my review here](http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/19/altra-lone-peak-30-first-impressions/). A more recent update is that I did the  [MCI Ballina Marathon](http://www.active.com/ballina-mayo/running/distance-running-races/3-marathons-in-2-days-marathon-challenge-2017) in them, as I expected much more trails. My feet were suffering by the end but they did surprisingly well for so much road. Overall they are great on rocky/gritty trails but far too slippy in Irish mud and bogs. I'm eyeing up both the [Inov-8 Mudclaws](https://www.inov-8.com/row/mudclaw-300-trail-running-shoes-yellow/) and various Salomons for the mud.

### Skechers GoRun 5
I immediately carved off at least 30 secs a mile with the [GoRun 5](https://www.skechers.com/en-us/style/54118/skechers-gorun-5) compared to the Paradigm. Even if it's all psychological, they work! They are featherlight compared to the Altras. Whilst they aren't zero drop and they have 10mm less padding, I adjusted to them instantly. The fact that they are cheap and available in any Skechers shop makes them even more attractive. I love them except for one thing - they are far too narrow. Both my little toes were shredded by them last week in the Brighton Marathon. But if you don't have wide feet, these are fantastic.

![GoRun5](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gorun5.jpeg)

## Running Jacket, Tops, Pants and Socks
Most of my running tops come from the races I have completed. The 2016 Berlin Marathon one is by far my favourite and I actually got a second one, I like it so much. The worst was the 2016 Cork Marathon one which I recently described as a EuroSaver Barbed Wire Boobtube.

But my top tip for running gear is Lidl. I've worn through the crotches of two Lidl running shorts. I still use their tops and socks. I've never used their running shoes but they look fine.

I love the [Decathlon Kalenji](https://www.kalenji.co.uk/jackets-idfam3799) rainproof/windproof running jacket I got last December. I've gone up mountains in it and not a drop of water got through. I'm not sure if they still sell the exact one. It was approx €30 in their store in La Defense. However it's not breathable so you will pour with sweat.

I've a bunch of different socks including Balega, Inov-8, 1000 Mile and Hillies. If Jamil Coury can do 3 loops of the Barkley Marathon in $2.50 Target socks, I don't think you need to worry too much about them.

My main running shorts are [Ron Hill](http://www.runandbecome.com/item/Ronhill/Advance-Contour-Lycra-Shorts/32DY) and [Mizuno](https://www.sportsshoes.com/product/miz2497/mizuno-core-mid-running-tights-~-aw16/). They give me the least chafing over marathon distances. Both lack decent pocket space for gels tho. I also now use [Runderwear](https://www.runderwear.co.uk/) and of course [Bodyglide](https://www.sportsshoes.com/product/bdy4/body-glide-chamois-glide-balm-(42g)/) or similar. I've had zero issues in that area since I switched to that combo.

## Running Watch
I paid a silly amount of money for my [Garmin Fenix 3 Sapphire](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2015/03/garmin-fenix3-detailed-review.html). And I haven't regretted it for one second. At the time it was Garmin's most expensive watch. I got it because of the crazy number of features, the multi-sport aspect, the ruggedness, the 7-day battery life and the fact that it looks ok as a normal watch (albeit very big). I just couldn't deal with charging an Apple Watch every night. Over the past 16 months it has lived up to every expectation and the software keeps improving. It has Wifi built-in so even when it loses Bluetooth connection to my phone (a very common Galaxy S6 problem), it can still upload all data to the ""cloud"". It has only screwed up on GPS badly once, at the Berlin Marathon. Oddly, it had some GPS issues today for the first time in 6 months. Not sure why.

The new [Fenix 5](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/03/garmin-fenix5-5s-5x-review.html) looks like a superb upgrade but I'll be holding on to the 3 for quite a few years. The only two things it is missing are built-in heart rate monitor and the ability to deal with Smart Bluetooth sensors (I think it can only do Ant+).

In reality, the cheapest Garmin Forerunners are more than enough but if you have even the cheapest Android phone, that is perfectly capable of doing the job, using a range of third party apps (see below).

![Fenix 3](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fenix3.jpg)

## Heart Rate Monitor
I previously had a Lidl Bluetooth HRM chest strap but it didn't work with the Fenix 3. I replaced it with the [Garmin Ant+ HRM chest strap](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/15490) and it has worked flawlessly. It has been very interesting watching my steady-state running heart rate go down as my fitness goes up. I also love getting ""Extreme Suffer Score"" on Strava due to having my heart at 155bpm for hours on end.

The chest straps are apparently more accurate than the the wrist one built into watches but obviously the latter are handier and involve one less piece of kit.

![HRM](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hrm.jpg)

## Running App
I've used em all. And like most people I have settled on [Strava](http://www.strave.com). Not because it is necessarily technically the best but it has the most number of integrations to things like Garmin devices and it has the biggest community.

I can't really criticise it. It does everything I need and they keep improving it. I'd love if you could add photos from the web-app and some of the navigation is awkward. But that's it. The Garmin integration is great.

## Running Dynamics
Don't bother unless you are stats obsessed. I got the [Milestone Pod](http://www.milestonepod.com/) as it's fantastic value. I really only got it for properly tracking treadmill runs. It gives a ton of info about stride length, foot strike, cadence, ground contact, rate of impact etc. I'm just not sure I'm going to change how I run as a result. I also think it's 100% wrong about me heel striking. Possibly due to my weight? It uses Bluetooth Smart and works with Strava too.

![Milestone Pod](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pod.jpeg)

## Weighing scales
For the past 6 years I've used an [Omron BF510 scales](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Omron-BF510-Composition-Bathroom-Scales/dp/B001N064JW) with fat analysis etc. I manually transcribed the data to a Google Docs spreadsheet. I finally upgraded this year but decided to keep it cheap. The [Yunmai M1301 scales](http://www.gearbest.com/monitoring-testing/pp_332025.html) is absolutely brilliant. It gives all the same fat data as the Omron but without needing to hold hand sensors. It uses Bluetooth Smart to talk to a mobile App and uploads the data to their cloud. Unfortunately there is no web-app to access or download your data - you are stuck with the mobile App. I wrote a [Node.js app](https://github.com/conoro/yunmai-data-extract) to deal with this (saves to Google Sheets) if you are interested.

Obviously you could pay double for a Withings or Garmin or similar.

![Yunmai](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yunmai.JPG)

## Headphones
I spent years trying every type of headphone. The ones that have worked best are these [SMS Audio Sports](https://smsaudio.com/products/in-ear-wired-sport) headphones. No amount of sweat seems to bother them. The inline controls only work fully with iPhone. On Galaxy S6 you only have play/pause and skip. Like most recent headphones it has a right-angled jack. Which is a total pain if you have your phone in a sports armband. I've had to buy a [Fospower inline extension](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B016E5PEXC/ref=pe_385721_51767431_TE_dp_1) to make it easier to insert/remove.

I recently had another go at Bluetooth headphones. I gave up on the [Motorola SD10 HD](http://conoroneill.net/motorola-s10-hd-are-brilliant-bluetooth-running-headphones/) due to head pain. I'm very tempted by the [Jaybird X2](https://www.amazon.com/Jaybird-Sport-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B013HSW4SM) but I decided to get [cheap Anker IE20](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01DZXFB1Q/ref=pe_385721_51767431_TE_dp_1) to see if I'd like that style of behind-the-neck cable. And the answer is no. I hate having the cable move around on my neck and pull at my ears. I also only got 2.5 hours from them which is 3 hours short for one of my marathons. So I'm sticking with the SMS.

![SMS](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sms.png)

## Armband and Other Bands
[Belkin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0081EE9Q8/ref=pe_217191_31005151_M3C_dp_2) are the only ones that have worked well for me with various Android phones. But I have a Galaxy S8+ on the way and I think it may be too big for my arm. So I'll be trying to use it with this [FlipBelt](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01CH0CXQO/ref=pe_385721_51767431_TE_dp_1).

## Nutrition & Hydration
[Torq gels](http://www.torqfitness.co.uk/nutrition/torq-gel) were recommended to me several years ago by a friend. I still love them. They actually taste nice, unlike most which are disgusting. However they are pricey from the UK. Last summer I bought a ton of different ones when in San Francisco. I'm now a big fan of some of [GU's gels](https://shop.guenergy.com/products/energy-gel?variant=12137185921). Particularly the ones with caffeine in them. Caramel is a real fave. Their chews are also extremely good.

I normally just use water for hydration and whatever is offered during races. The warm tea in Berlin was a highlight and the Lucozade Sport in Dublin worked very well too. Recently I used some electrolyte powder in my water bottle on a training run and it was fine. Just not sure I need it.

I really like [this water Ultimate Performance water bottle](http://www.wiggle.com/ultimate-performance-kielder-handheld-bottle-carrier/). It has an adjustable elastic strap and a waterproof pouch for your car keys and emergency €20.

![Bottle](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bottle.jpg)

## Hydration Pack/Bag
I got a €10 pack and bladder from a Chinese site last year but it chafed like hell. The 15yo used the bladder in his backpack on some scouting hikes instead.

When I was in the massive Decathlon store in Paris last December, I got the [Kalenji Trail Running Bag](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/mens-trail-bag-id_8312245.html). I used it on a couple of hikes in [Ballyhoura](http://visitballyhoura.com/) recently and I loved it. I didn't try the bladder, I just used it as an ultra-lightweight pack with easy access to pockets for compass, maps, bivvy bag, GoPro-knockoff and water bottles. I've also just bought some [Ron Hill Soft Flasks](https://www.sportsshoes.com/product/ron1682/ronhill-trail-fuel-328ml-bottle-~-ss17/) to go in the chest pockets.

![Backpack](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kalenji_backpack.jpeg)

## Glasses and Contact Lenses
""Disposable"" shades from Lidl, [dx.com](http://www.dx.com/s/sunglasses) or [banggood.com](http://www.banggood.com/search/sunglasses.html) are all I ever wear. All are less than €10 and usually last a year or two. So it's no problem if they break, get scratched or get lost. I'm sure €200 designer shades are great but I'm not wasting my money on that.

![Cheapo Sunglasses](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sunglasses.jpg)

As for contact lenses, Acuvue Trueye do the job for me. The only time I really wear lenses is when I run. [FeelGoodContacts in the UK](https://www.feelgoodcontacts.com/contact-lenses/1-day-acuvue-trueye) are the best value I've found.

## Go Pro Knock-Offs
I've [already reviewed](http://conoroneill.com/2016/10/02/timoleague-courtmacsherry-elephone-explorer-pro/) the [Elephone Explorer Pro](http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_314991.html). Poor battery life alone means I can't recommend it. If I was serious I'd get the [Go Pro Hero 5 Black](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2016/10/gopro-hero5-black-review.html). But I'm not, so I'll probably get the [Yi II](http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_360137.html?wid=3) for less than half the price soon and retire the Elephone to dashcam duties.

All our research gives us a gut intuition,"Another memorable quote from ""The Apprentice, Martha Stewart"".

On a completely unrelated topic, [Digg ](http://digg.com/)has gone to Version 3\. Digg is a news site whose top stories are voted into position by the users. Up until now it was mainly tech but they have branched out in V3\. 

I've never used it much as it causes total information overload. But the [Diggnation Podcast](http://revision3.com/diggnation) with Alex and Kevin is hysterically funny.

I had a quick look today just to see what had changed. There was [an interesting story on Digg User stats](http://digg.com/tech_news/Statistics_on_Digg_Users) - 94% male. Feign shock.

Altra Lone Peak 3.0 first impressions,"Now that I've done my first trail race, it's time for my initial impressions of the [Altra Lone Peak 3.0](https://www.altrarunning.com/men/lone-peak-30). Back in June I got a pair of LP 2.5 in [Sports Basement](https://sports-basement.myshopify.com/pages/store-sf-bryant-street/) in San Francisco. They were supposed to be my first pair of trail runners but I found them so comfy they immediately became my daily shoes. When I went to get another pair in Europe I learned that they were about to be replaced with the 3.0. If you can find any pairs of 2.5, grab them, they are a complete bargain now and very different to the 3.0.

The best place I found to get the 3.0 on this side of the pond was [Accelerate UK](http://www.accelerateuk.com/shop/product/21/Mountain--Trail-and-Fell/Altra-ZeroDrop-Lone-Peak-3-0/). They sent me one of the first pairs they got last week. They look completely different to the 2.5 and TBH are a bit generic. 

![LP30 Clean](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/A1653_Orange_btn4_xl.jpg)

The main changes, apart from looks are a smaller ""last"" and a grippier sole. Whilst the 2.5 are a bit loose on me, the 3.0 is snug and a perfect fit with the usual Altra benefits of wide toe-box, high stack and zero drop. I was concerned when I did a short first run on them on the treadmill that my left arch hurt a lot. The insole at the arch seems to be very high on these. Much higher than any other Altras. 

But the real test came yesterday during Run Forest Run and they were fantastic. The fit on my foot remained great, the arch pain was gone and the grip was incredible on all of the surfaces. Just a warning that whilst they are trail shoes, they are not waterproof as I quickly discovered. Irish puddles, yay.

![LP30](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/lone_peak_30.jpg)

I know lots of other people have the same criticism of Altra that I do. I love their products but this sizing nonsense has to stop. It's bad enough that two of your products fit completely differently for the same nominal size, but when you are doing it between versions of the same product, it's just ridiculous! From what I can see, every review of the 3.0 on the Altra site is complaining about the sizing. 

So in summary - I'm a big fan of the LP 3.0. But go 1 Euro size up from your usual running shoes. Unfortunately no one in Ireland seems to sell them so, if they don't fit, you may be in the usual world of product returns cost hell that we suffer from over here."
An ex-church or nunnery in a small town near Cork from McCarthy's Bar??,"An old old friend (bet ya like that description Jane) is living over in Frankfurt. Her hubby has just finished McCarthy's Bar and is dying to visit the place mentioned in the book which he describes as an ex-church or nunnery in a small town near Cork, on the coast, known for it's good cuisine.

An important one for Bandon residents,"The bandon.ie blog has [an important post](http://www.bandon.ie/blogspot/2008/03/hiring-of-consultants-for-bandon-area.html) about the Action Plan for the improvement of Bandon town centre. They have full details on what it's all about but the critical bit is having **your say**. Let the consultants who are drawing up the proposals know what you think should be done to improve the town. Some off the top of my head are:

*   Finish the bypass (I know I know, this isn't in their remit)
*   Improved street lighting, particularly on bypass
*   Extended footpaths on all major routes out of town
*   Changing junction priorities
*   Traffic lights at top of Glasslyn
*   Removal of some right turns in the town
*   Better bus stops
*   Encouraging the owners of all the land on Glasslyn to develop it
*   Encouraging a new commercial indoor play area
*   Presenting Bandon as a great location for hi-tech biz. Lower cost that Cork City and only 30 mins from the airport. I'm afraid Laragh doesn't cut it. Some EI subsidised units in town or maybe a hotdesking facility like they have in Macroom
*   Presenting Bandon as a full-service town for people moving to Cork. In particular the great schools and sports facilities
*   Presenting Bandon as a great location for high-end restaurants. If Otto and Casino House can be huge successes in the middle of nowhere, why can't we have high end places here?
*   A toll for trucks that go through town, particularly those destroying North Main Street that could easily go via Baxter's Bridge
*   A major revamp of the North side of town with an effort to get more retail businesses and doing something about ease of parking. Revamp of The Shambles should only be the beginning.
So get over to the bandon.ie blog and let the consultants know what you think!"

"And wuv, tru wuv, will fowow you foweva...","We are nearly a week into our Sky+ Box ownership. It's not often something far exceeds your expectation but this bloody thing does so with ease. The wee beauty can record two channels at the same time. There is some very impressive buffer management going on in there. We have set a bunch of recordings of weekly shows plus any movies that catch my eye no matter what time they start. Of course a VCR can do a lot of this but not with a browse feature and saved program information too. We can now record Nip/Tuck and Grand Designs  Abroad at the same time. Why is it that so many of the programs we like clash with other programs we like?

And whilst I'm on the topic - that new Masterchef was fantastic, but 6.30pm? Get a clue you dim-wits. That is when most people who like cooking ARE cooking. Presumably the tristans (to steal an AA Gill term) who scheduled it eat out every night and wouldn't know what the little people do. Anyway, 7pm, the dead zone, is a far better time for most of us.

Back to Sky+; The live-pause feature is the piece de resistance (yeah, I'm too lazy to figure out how to do french accent symbols). Having three kids creating mayhem and refusing to go to bed during the new series of Doctor Who is no longer a problem. Start watching, Ois?n screams, hit pause, come back 5 mins later, hit play, fight erupts, hit pause, back 10 minutes later, hit play. Overall program finishes 15 minutes later than the original. I hate complimenting Rupert over anything but they really have done a fantastic job on this thing.

As for Doctor Who. Hmm, undecided. Totally tongue in cheek, but then so was Tom Baker. Dislike his constant grinning (did Baker do that?).  A lot of the  humour will unfortunately date very quickly (bringing out a jukebox millions of years in the future and saying ""we believe this was called an iPod""). But at the same time, it is rollicking good fun. The bi-pedal pig last night was hilarious and the aliens are nearly scary. I think my darlings (5, 3, 1) are still a bit too young to watch it but Oscar is showing definite interest in having a look.

And that sound of the Tardis as it disappears still gives me the willies."

Announcing Bandon Flood Early Warning System on Twitter,"I'm a big fan of the [Bandon FEWS system](http://www.bandonfloodwarning.ie/) which sends an SMS when the river at the bridge hits a certain level. It must be a life-saver for many businesses and people in the town.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fews1.png ""fews1"")](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fews1.png)

I have had a few thoughts on other things we could do with that live river-level data for the community. Web-apps, Twitter integration, Analytics, Trends etc etc.

However, despite several communications, I have been unable to get any response from Cork County Council about getting access to the live data. All the OpenData initiatives around the world (including Ireland) are obviously passing them by.

Even something as simple as a Twitter Account could be useful and interesting. So I created one called [@BandonFEWS](https://twitter.com/#!/bandonfews). Of course then I had to get at the data despite the CoCo's silence. I dug around the Bandon Flood Warning site but it is built in such a way that the data is not machine visible or scrapable.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fews2.png ""fews2"")](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fews2.png)

I discussed this problem with fellow tech-person Gordon Murray of [Murrion Software](http://www.murrion.ie/) just up the road in Carrigadrohid and of course he had a solution!

Gordon's company has a very smart SMS service which can both send SMSes and receive them in order to act upon them. By signing up his service's ""phone"" number to the FEWS SMS alerts, he can then do something with them. In this case, he takes the SMS, interprets it and then posts it automatically to the @BandonFEWS Twitter account.

Nice one Gordon! If you have any need of inbound or outbound SMS services, [give him a shout](http://twitter.com/murrion).

Now if only Cork CoCo would give us access to all of the live data, we could do some really interesting things for the community for free. Anyone got any influence in there to make this happen?"

Another fine Market,"Saturday was showery and windy but that didn't seem to deter the crowds to the Farmer's Market in Bandon. I popped down with big sis Fiona and babba Fionn. Before I headed out I had been reading a great article on the ""old"" market in the Bandon Opinion. Well worth seeking out, particularly for the description of the overwhelming stench of s***te that used to accompany the market in the old days.

I took along my new N70 to snap a few pictures but I only managed to take a few. Apologies to any stall owners who have not been photographed yet.

First stop was the Baking Emporium from Dunmanway. These people make one of my fave products which we buy all the time in supermarkets around Cork - crisp breads. But these are not your average ryvita, they are packed full of flavour and texture and make the basis for a great lunch. There were none of those on display yesterday, just a great selection of interesting looking breads and cakes. I heard one of the people behind the stall say ""nay"" to one of the others. ""ah, they must be Dutch"" I thought. Then they spoke more and I realised they were German. I guessed they might be Schwabisch from the ""nay"". Sure enough, the customer beside me said ""my husband will be thrilled to hear you are here. He is from Stuttgart too"". It turns out she was also German and a big chat auf Deutsch ensued. I stood there remembering the summer of 1988 when a bunch of student engineers from UCD headed to Stuttgart, stayed in a campsite near [Neckar Stadion](http://www.gottlieb-daimler-stadion.de/stadion_en.htm) for a while, then got rooms in a studenten wohnheim and worked in the kitchens of an altenheim outside [Esslingen](http://www.esslingen.de/servlet/PB/menu/-1/index.html). I bought some lovely rye bread and mini-tarts. I had a sambo later with the bread and further reminiscences of salami sandwich breakfasts came to mind!

I was gasping for a cup of coffee and the Cork Coffee Roasters stall was exactly what we needed. Great lattes and some fine looking biscotti and kettle popcorn too. I got some of their ground coffeee the previous time from Urru but forgot yesterday. Dumbass.

I hadn't got to Sonia's Pickles the last time and made a beeline yesterday. She gave me some tastes of ones involving peppers, aubergines and pinenuts. It was a tough choice and many could be bought in either nice looking jars or bigger plastic tubs for the same money. I got two types and sis got a lovely looking rosewater jelly.

[![Sonia](http://static.flickr.com/55/141806034_04a34af221_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/141806034/ ""Photo Sharing"")

After not spotting them the last time, there now seemed to be eggs everywhere! I got some fine looking free range O'Briens ones. Fiona got some chicken liver pate from the same blokes.

I rounded the visit off with more super-delish choccies from Gwen's.

Sis bought some great veg which had the reassuring mud still on them. Her only negative comment, which I agreed with, was that it was a pity that there are no fresh meat vendors there. There are guys who do their own organic beef at Skibb and Midleton. It'd be great to get similar in Bandon. Is there also a guy over near Aherla who has a big Duck and Goose farm? I'm sure they would be popular.

It really does look like the market is getting better and better. All of the new stands add to the breadth of goods on sale and I think it has already become an integral part of the Saturday shopping for a lot of people. Roll on the next one in two weeks time."

Poor ickle-wickle Alexa, the bad man fired her.

100 chickens for 100 pizzas? And this woman did Economics in Cambridge?

Sugar fired Karen before this little girlie? Her dazed look during the firing session was priceless. And good old Syed came up with another classic. Sir Alan: ""Tell me why I shouldn't fire you?"". Syed:""Because I'm a winner!"". That is an all time great answer. How do you argue with it? I think he may have flummoxed da  boss.

The title ""Management Consultant"" is soon going to enter common parlance as being a euphemism for incompetent bullshit artist. The problem with Management Consultants (and Mani is one too) is that they only know how to tell other people what they are doing wrong, they haven't the slightest clue how to do things themselves. Most of the Consultants in this series look confused because there seems to be nowhere for them to charge billable hours.

To be fair to Mani, I thought he was going to arse the thing up completely but actually pulled a blinder in the end. However, he still has all the people skills of a morgue technician.

Back to the Food Future,"This isn't good food, it's fantastic food. The Irish have forgotten the power of preserving and this is a big wake-up call. Lip-smackingly gorgeous duck confit that is an absolute bargain and a doddle to prepare.

Disclosure: I received several of these products for free and did not pay delivery.

Quite a while back Laurent of [Confit de France](http://www.confitdefrance.com) contacted me and a bunch of other foodie bloggers about his new ecommerce store which was selling a variety of preserved French foods including confit, pate, rillettes and foie gras. (yeah yeah vegans, we've heard it all before, do something useful and go annoy someone about battery chickens instead).

Laurent was particularly excited by the confit and I went to order some. Unfortunately whilst the products themselves were great value, the delivery was very expensive if you didn't order a lot. Therefore Laurent offered to send me some for free to try out. The great news is that since then, he has dropped the price of delivery by a huge amount and everything is now a bargain.

Over the past few weeks I've been trying the various things he sent me and I'll mention them all. But first, the duck. I got a large four-portion tin which was filled to the brim with duck fat. I poured off the fat and the gelatin and put the four very large legs into a frying pan.

[![26022009317](http://photos5.pix.ie/06/42/06420E1ED2124B57AA347531F31696D1-240.jpg)](http://pix.ie/conor/844904 ""26022009317 by conor"") 

I kept them on the heat until they were hot through and the skin had started to crisp up. However I think the oven method would be better for crisping and will try that the next time.

[![26022009319](http://photos2.pix.ie/10/76/10760D9CBE2343A4853C9D551A16069B-240.jpg)](http://pix.ie/conor/844902 ""26022009319 by conor"")

We just had it with a simple green salad and it was stunning. When you see how expensive duck breast is and how many times I've messed up the cooking of it, these confit legs are a doddle and more tasty in many ways. The fat makes amazing roast spuds too!

The other products I got were as follows:

*   Goose Rillettes: I discovered the joy of rillettes at Taste of Cork and had tons of it on holidays in France. It's basically pate with the meat shredded rather than pureed. Gorgeous on toast.

*   Confit Duck in Orange: The duck and sauce were excellent but there wasn't enough fondant potatoes.

As I mentioned above, we seem to have forgotten the importance and usefulness of preserving. With all the money people were making in recent years, it was like curing/pickling/preserving/canning were somehow from our poor past. Apart from bacon, all we wanted were expensive cuts of meat or stupidly priced ""premium"" ready meals.

The tin of baked beans is one of the most perfect food products ever. Our holidays in France reminded us of all the other things like duck confit and casoulet which came from poverty and lack of freezers but which are now pinnacles of gourmet food.

I hope one of the upsides of this recession is that we look again at our past and start learning how to cook the cheaper tastier cuts of meats, how to use pulses and grains, how to use preserved goods and how to live on a budget whilst still eating beautiful food.

Some might think this is the wrong time to be launching a site like Laurent's. I disagree, I can't think of a better time."

Ballincollig's permanent Orienteering Trail points the way for all West Cork towns,"We recently did a short family outing to the forest in [Castlefreke](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/?id=53andrec_site=16) just before the kids went back to school. Whilst the walk itself was fun and short enough to avoid the kids complaining too much, it brought up a ton of questions and ideas in my head, such as:

1.  Why is it so hard to find detailed information about walks/trails in West Cork and the rest of the country? The Irish Trails site is very poor indeed.
2.  Why is Coillte sticking to unreadable-by-normal-people Ordnance Survey type [maps in PDF format](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/?id=53andrec_site=16) in 2013?
3.  Why doesn't Coillte have iPhone and Android Apps for all forest activities?
4.  Wouldn't such an App be a perfect positive example of The Gathering in action?
5.  Wouldn't Google Streetview tours of the walks/trails/forests be an amazing resource?
6.  Why can't I tell from online info if a walk/trail is buggy-friendly or small-child friendly?
7.  Why is signage in Irish forests so utterly useless?
8.  Why are we talking about selling off our forests rather than turning them into strong tourism revenue generators?
In the case of Castlefreke, rather than just complaining, I turned on a GPS tracker on my phone during the walk and uploaded much improved data to [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.572699546813965andlon=-8.965208530426025andzoom=15) afterwards. I'd do the same on Google Maps but they don't have a Map Maker for Ireland yet. (Aside: Sign-up to be notified when it happens [here](http://code.google.com/p/google-mapmaker/wiki/MappingIE))

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rathbarry.jpg ""rathbarry"")](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.572699546813965andlon=-8.965208530426025andzoom=15)

On our next walk, my plan is to take a Contour GPS camera and video the whole thing with location info. So future walkers can see exactly what a trail is like rather than relying on vague text descriptions on web-sites.

So it was a real joy for me to read [Margaret Jordan's blogpost](http://ballincollig.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/ballincollig-regional-park-orienteering-course-and-trails/) this morning about the new permanent [Orienteering Trail](http://www.corko.net/ballincollig_poc) in Ballincollig Regional Park.  I did a bit of orienteering as a kid in the Scouts and absolutely loved it. It turned forest walks into an exciting adventure. It's a sport that people of every age and ability can do. The one in Ballincollig sounds perfect for families.

And if you think about what's involved, the cost to add this feature to any recreation space is very small. You could transform many barely used forests into hives of activity. But huge kudos to [Cafe Chico](http://www.cafechico.ie/) for sponsoring the one in Ballincollig.

Given that Bandon is now an ""Active Travel town"" and funding has supposedly been allocated for walking and cycling routes, wouldn't orienteering be an ideal and inexpensive way of achieving the aims of that initiative? I know we don't have many forests locally. I once tried to go for a walk in Duke's wood and failed miserably after a few yards. I wonder if Castlebernard would be amenable to such a thing? Or Manch? Are there other places, not necessarily forests where this could be done safely?

In the rest of West Cork there are plenty of areas where orienteering could slot right in. Imagine Lough Hyne or similar.

Thoughts? Problems? Suggestions?

UPDATE 1: I just noticed from the Cork Orienteering Club site that Farran has [a permanent course](http://www.corko.net/maps) too. That's two weekends sorted for us now!

UPDATE 2 (20/01/2013): Today we had a go at the course in Ballincollig. We printed off 7 maps and the guide and got our warm clothes on. Overall we had good fun despite the usual kids complaints. But (big but!), you have to do it in wellies at this time of year. Most of the route is either off-path or on mud-filled paths. We did a short loop of the first 6 markers or so and were very mucky by the end. It's not really suitable for people with buggies or very small children. Also if you want to split up into teams, there are a lot of rivers/streams/pools which means small kids must be accompanied by someone with sense. Highly recommended tho!

Our eldest has just started using Scratch and is finding it good fun. Here's a screenshot:

You currently need to have a laptop to take part in Coder Dojo. I know this excludes a lot of people but [Camara Ireland](http://coderdojo.com/2012/09/18/camara-laptops/) has stepped in to help there. You can get reconditioned laptops from them via the Coder Dojo movement for between €114 and €125, which is a great price.

I also wonder if there is any possibility for school PCs to be used during the Coder Dojos too? Or perhaps, over time, [Raspberry Pis](http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs) which people can bring and hook up to the monitors there? This would maximise the number of people who can get involved with Coder Dojo, no matter what their financial situation.

Note that parents must accompany children for the entire session. If you have any questions about it at all, contact bandoncoderdojo@gmail.com"
Bandon Farmer's Market Blog,"I set-up the [Bandon Farmer's Market Blog](http://bandonfarmersmarket.wordpress.com/) quite a while back. Progress has been slow with getting vendors to use it and I think this is mainly due to them not being familiar at all with [a] blogging and [b] the idea that they can write something and it appears immediately. I've learned a lot in trying to get one or two people set up on it. The main lesson was that if you are not web-savvy, many things which seem obvious to me can actually be insurmountable hurdles to others.

I set the blog up on wordpress.com but to be honest, Matt, Donncha and the boys need to make the whole sign-up process far more slick and user-friendly for non-techies. Simple things like the Terms and Conditions page threw some people. I never read those pages and always just tick the box but some users were clicking on the link, getting freaked out by the legalese and not going any further. The whole group blog sign-up is just wayyy to clunky for non-techies.

In any case, we should have Di Curtin, one of the organisers, motoring on it very soon. Anthony from Ummera has been the main contributor to date and Cork Coffee Roasters have signed up but not posted yet. I hope bit by bit that the other vendors start making use of it.

Check it out and subscribe to the RSS feed or email updates if you want to keep abreast of what's happening in the market. I encourage all readers of the blog to post comments and questions on it to extend the conversation beyond Saturday mornings!"
Bandon Farmer's Market just gets better and better,"I'm not just saying that because it's my local one. They keep adding really great stalls. I think the most important one is Ahern's organic meats. It's a bit easy to miss them because all the meat is in a freezer trailer and they just have a small table with the product list and prices. I got two t-bones and a bunch of burgers off them. Looking forward to BBQing them today in the rain.

Cork Coffee Roasters were doing a stunning Iced Latte. They told me that they were not selling well. I was shocked. Iced Lattes are up there with penicillin and the transistor as the 20th Century's greatest inventions. A life saver on a hot day. Bandonites and Bandonians should do themselves a favour and run down for a large one in two weeks time. In fact, I told Catherine about them when I got home and she zoomed down in the car to get one. She had two small comments on them - she'd prefer crushed ice and she'd prefer them to be even bigger!

I got the usual bunch of stuff and a few unusual bits like Quinoa salad. The Baking Emporium now have a new Spelt Muesli Crispbread which I got. Looks lovely.

A few piccies of my booty (in the non-Jennifer Lopez sense):

 If this infringes any copyright, let me know and I'll take it down

It had been thought that the sad passing of Peter Crowley, who had been the main driving force behind the setting up of a Farmer's Market in Bandon, would result in the plan being shelved. However, I was thrilled to read in the current edition of the Bandon Opinion that the organizing committee have not given up and Peter's daughter is now involved.

The plan is for the market to take place in (what would commonly be known as) the Mace Carpark in the middle of town. The first one will be on Saturday April 1st and will run on the first Saturday of every month up to and including September.

I'm sure all food producers in the area know about it already but if you don't and you are interested in taking a stall, please contact [Dianne Curtin](mailto:dicurtin@eircom.net) or [Veronica Neville](mailto:veronica@rneville.com).

This is genuinely a great leap forward for Bandon. As a historical centre of food production for centuries with very productive agricultural land in the area and as a market town, it is only right and proper that we should celebrate Bandon's local food producers and provide them with the opportunity to sell directly to the public.

I am convinced that Farmer's Markets do not reduce revenue for local businesses, rather they increase business due to the larger number of customers attracted to the town who might otherwise go to Clon or Cork.

Now all we need is for someone to open a micro-brewery and I'll be a very happy man.

For those of you wondering where the Mace Car Park is, follow this link to [Microsoft Windows Live Local](http://local.live.com/?v=2andsp=aN.51.743760_-8.738509_Bandon%20Farmer%27s%20Market_Mace%20Car%20Park). I was very surprised to discover that Microsoft Maps is far superior to Google Maps for rural Ireland.

This is the structured version of the previous post and highlights how some of the most important information is presented in a way which is easily collected by automated systems.

I have a few observations of my own on the hCalendar structure and the Wordpress plugin:

[1] The Address Fields are very U.S. centric

[2] It would be nice to have a ""Map"" field to highlight the specific location

[3] There is no facility for repeating events. I know this is a major topic of conversation among the developers of the hCalendar format. But to me it is 
critical for any Calendar structure.

[4] The Tags don't get hyperlinked over to Technorati

[5] As mentioned in my first review of the Structured Blogging plug-in, we lose all rich text editing when using it.

 These issues are all fixable and do not detract from the advantages offered by the addition of structure.

Bandon Farmer's Market now has a web-site,I'm always happy to see local initiatives get an online presence to extend their reach. My attempt to create a blog for Bandon Farmer's Market three years ago fell flat due to my lack of consultation with the standholders to ensure buy-in. So it is great to see the new site launch with all the details you need. [Check it out here](http://www.bandonfarmersmarket.com/) and don't forget it is on every Saturday morning.
Bandon Farmer's Market on Easter Saturday,"<div class='vevent x-wpsb-simple-event'>

Ireland
    </span></p>       <div>

I was thrilled to receive an email from Dianne Curtin, one of the organisers of the Bandon Farmer's Market and food writer for the very fine Bandon Opinion. She brought up a few points which I'll cover here. 

The first is the great news that they have added Easter Saturday as an extra market day and if interest continues, they fully intend to move to weekly. I am really delighted for all the organisers and stall-holders. The feedback I got elsewhere was that business was excellent on the day (rather than just people browsing) and the hope is that the strong buzz will continue.

The second thing that Dianne mentioned was that I was incorrect about the lack of eggs at Saturday's market. She told me that James O'Brien from Valley View Free Range Eggs in Bandon had a stall. His eggs are free range, some produced on his farm and the rest on the farms of specially selected farmers in the immediate Bandon locality.

To quote Dianne:

> James works to an extremely high standard and his eggs are quite frankly delicious.  He is a smashing guy, a committed food producer and also the founder of the Irish Free Range Egg Producers Association.

I am spitting that I missed his stand. I think his may have been one of those that was so mobbed I couldn't get anywhere near it. I'll be stocking up at the next market.

Dianne also mentioned the Ballinscarthy ladies next door to James who had a few trays of their own free range eggs which were snapped up in no time, as were all their home baked cakes made with free range eggs.

I assume these are the ""Five Ladies From Ballinscarthy"" that John McKenna mentioned? They should use that as their brand!

I'm looking forward to checking out both stalls and all the others I missed the last time.

If you are wondering where the Market is on, have a look at this map on [Microsoft Live Local](http://local.live.com/?v=2&sp=aN.51.743760_-8.738509_Bandon%20Farmer%27s%20Market_Mace%20Car%20Park).

Once again I encourage everyone to attend the Bandon Market whether they live in Bandon, Ballincollig, Ballinspittle, Barryroe, Ballineen, Butlerstown or Boston.

Bandon Farmer's Market quiet last week,"I finally made it down to the market last week after missing three in a row. A lot of the usual stalls were missing presumably due to holidays etc and&nbsp;it was a quick dash and grab by Fionn, Sibéal and I. 

More stunning steaks from Aherns, some interesting and tasty Portuguese salt from Ummera, some veg from the veg man and some brot from the&nbsp;&nbsp;Baking Emporium in Dunmanway and I was done.

It struck me that it may be worthwhile for the organisers to do a few surveys at the market. I'd love to know some facts like:

*   Are you very local, local, passing through or a tourist?
*   Is this your first visit?
*   How many times have you been here?
*   Are you regular?
*   Will you be back?
*   What do you buy?
*   What are you favourite aspects of the market?
*   What are your least favourite aspects?
*   What is it missing?
*   How often would you like to see the market happen? 

For me, I think the market is superb but there is a definite tendency to the high end of things. I would love to see more basic produce suppliers there like the veg man but selling at supermarket cost or below (due to the lack of a middleman).

I'll post the next set of dates for the market when I find them out. I didn't know a few of the recent ones were happening until the day before. All in all it has been a great few months for the market and I see it getting better and better.

Bandon Flood (FEWS) Open Data Now Available ,"I was thrilled to get such positive feedback about the [@BandonFEWS](http://twitter.com/BandonFEWS) Twitter account yesterday. Thanks again to [Gordon](http://twitter.com/murrion) for doing all the actual work whilst I basked in the glory :-) It was even better considering how sick I am with a nasty tummy bug. The bug means I can do little useful work for the past few days. But I can play with code.

One fantastic outcome from [yesterday's blogpost](http://conoroneill.com/2011/11/16/announcing-bandon-flood-early-warning-system-on-twitter/) was John Handelaar and others pointing out that I'd given up too easily on trying to extract the river level data from the [Bandon FEWS web-site](http://www.bandonfloodwarning.ie/). And it turns out they were right. A small amount of messing around and I was able to extract out the water level and the date/time.

I've been meaning to do more with [Google Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/) for ages and this seemed like a good opportunity. It's like a Google Docs online spreadsheet but with knobs on. So  you can populate, query, visualise etc using an API. I decided to use that to make the FEWS data available to everyone. Of course then I ran into the horror that is OAuth2\. But a fair bit of messing and stomach cramps later, and I got that working too.

So we now have [the hourly Bandon river level data available](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=103YIcARoxuaWT7NfZ8mVBzY554sF_3ONYC1N3DE) to use for whatever purpose your fiendish minds can come up with. I'm thinking trends, analytics, charts, maps, mashups with weather data, other alerting methods (email, Twitter DMs, iPhone Alerts), a Facebook Fan Page, widgets for other Bandon-related sites. What other ideas do you all have?

<iframe width=""500px"" height=""300px"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""http://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?gco_allowHtml=true&gco_displayAnnotations=true&gco_wmode=opaque&gco_chartArea=%7B%22top%22%3A%2230%22%7D&containerId=gviz_canvas&rmax=250&q=select+col1%2C+col0+from+2191951+&qrs=where+col1+%3E%3D+&qre=+and+col1+%3C%3D+&qe=+order+by+col1+asc&viz=GVIZ&t=TIMELINE&width=500&height=300""></iframe>

If you want to embed that live graph on your own site or blog, just paste this code in:

[javascript]
&lt;iframe width= 500px  height= 300px  scrolling= no  frameborder= no  src= http://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?gco_allowHtml=trueandgco_displayAnnotations=trueandgco_wmode=opaqueandgco_chartArea=%7B%22top%22%3A%2230%22%7DandcontainerId=gviz_canvasandrmax=250andq=select+col1%2C+col0+from+2191951+andqrs=where+col1+%3E%3D+andqre=+and+col1+%3C%3D+andqe=+order+by+col1+ascandviz=GVIZandt=TIMELINEandwidth=500andheight=300 &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
[/javascript]

You can export the data to CSV and play with it offline in Excel etc or you can go fancy and query it live over the API.

e.g. this API call grabs all of the data in one go (you can test with your browser): [https://fusiontables.googleusercontent.com/fusiontables/api/query?sql=SELECT+ROWID,+riverlevel,+datetime+FROM+2191951](https://fusiontables.googleusercontent.com/fusiontables/api/query?sql=SELECT+ROWID,+riverlevel,+datetime+FROM+2191951)

But of course you will be able to do far more complex queries than that, once we have a decent body of data. See the [Google Fusion Tables Guide here](http://code.google.com/apis/fusiontables/docs/developers_guide.html).

Note that I was forced to use that awkward date format to make the timeline feature in Fusion Tables work correctly.

I don't know if anyone wants the data or will find a use for it but this first step was critical to enabling them to do so. Hopefully this will be a trigger for others to liberate locked-in non-private data on other public sector sites.

Or it could be an opportunity for County Councils to take this tough time we are all living in, where Capex projects are few and far between, and start a [Data Liberation Project](http://www.dataliberation.org/) in every Council department in the country. Nothing I did over the past 24hrs cost a single solitary cent apart from people's time. And based on recent conversations with old college friends, time is one thing a lot of Council Engineers have on their hands. If any Council people are interested in reading more they should have a look at the links [in this post](http://www.web2ireland.org/2011/01/17/the-ireland-api/) I did at the start of the year.

Bandon’s Young Ambassadors will be on the street both days, guiding shoppers to the best bargains and the free refreshments.

Come on down!"
Bandon.ie revamp,"Trevor and crew have done a big revamp of the [bandon.ie](http://www.bandon.ie/). Tons of useful information about the town and area and the beginnings of a local business directory. You should definitely be subscribed to the blog if you want the latest news. I push all their blog updates to [Twitter here](http://twitter.com/bandon) too.

The best way you can help the site is to make sure you let them know about everything that is happening in the town. It's a resource by the community for the community."
Bandon in 8-bit Google Maps,"Go to [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/). Zoom into Bandon. Click Quest. Gotta love a giant global corporation that allows stuff like this to be made.

Bandon Music Festival June bank Holiday Weekend,"Get yer dancing shoes on because they really do have a line-up to suit everyone this year.

> As with previous years the Bandon Music Festival will consist of two free outdoor concerts on Saturday and Sunday.  In addition, the Music Trail will take place each night of the festival in local pubs.  These sessions will consist of trad, folk and rock.  Added to this, there will be street entertainment throughout the weekend, with live music at the Farmers’ Market and the Red Patrollers appearing in Riverview Shopping Centre on Saturday afternoon. Sunday will see “Rubicon” play on Oliver Plunkett Street joined by set dancers.

> This year will see Director and Duke Special perform live outdoors on Sat  2nd June. Then on Sun 3rd June, Mary Black will headline the outdoor concert, supported by Jennifer Lomasney

There has been a lot of buzz around Director recently so it's a real coup for the organisers to get them. 

The [official web-site is here](www.bandonmusicfestival.com).

UPDATE 1: To be honest, I'd never heard of Jennifer Lomasney. [She's seriously good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITBsdwwjqXU)!"

Bandon Parade,"We finally made it down to our first St Patrick's Day Parade in Bandon. The kids really enjoyed it (2 year old loved the tractors and fire engines). I was a bit surprised how short it was and the person beside me mentioned the lack of music. Face painting and balloon shapes went down very well. I wish I'd managed to see all the old cars as the pristine Escort (Mexico?) looked fantastic from a distance.

I noticed the Scouts were allowed wear jackets. In my day in Kilkenny we didn't even have jumpers :-)

Here's a few photos and videos:

A few weeks before Easter I noticed a new sign go up where Roco's restaurant used to be. Roco's was a middle-of-the-road place which I ate in twice. The food was fine and the place was always hopping. I was very surprised when they shut it down. But Roco's had one awful feature - the room itself. It just felt bitterly cold with one entire wall of glass and a tiled floor. I just did not like eating there because I didn't feel comfortable. Harsh and echoey.

The name of the new place really caught my eye ""Bandon River Grill"". Oh ho I thought, someone else who thinks a steak and frites place is sorely missing in the area? I have this idea that a restaurant like Les Halles where Anthony Bourdain works in NY would go down a storm here (and anywhere). Good simple classic food served in basic relaxed surroundings with a big buzz and great atmos. Note that I have never been there, I just have his cookbook, his other food books and I've seen the restaurant on one of his tv shows.

At that time the Grill still looked under construction so I waited a bit and then stopped for a look at the menu just before Easter weekend. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. A dinner menu with just a few items - steak, fish, pork and veggie. All ""of the day"" so no detailed descriptions. Lunch looked great too with fab sounding burgers and lots of ""all you can eat"" sides. Total focus on fresh local ingredients served as you like it and the size you like it. I also spotted an ad from them in the local Bandon Opinion seeking ""fun"" waiting staff and offering very good hourly rates.

The signs were good, I booked a table for last Friday and my dear lady wife and I tootled on down at 7pm for dinner. The entrance area (which used to be the wine bar part of Roco's) seemed little changed. I was a bit thrown to find a very genteel welcome with live piano music in the background. There appeared to be a display cabinet for food in the corner with a chefy guy behind it and some patrons in front. All of the waitresses were wearing what they called ""cheerfeeder"" outfits which looked very American and themed-diner style. All wore wireless headsets.

We were shown to the table and had the ""system"" explained to us. We took a quick glance at the menu which really had nothing on it and then over to the display cabinet where the chef-guy explained each type of starter, fish main, steak main and other that was available that evening. Meat from Martin Carey with beef hung for a fortnight and fish fresh every day from Kinsale. I went for a simple smoked salmon starter and Catherine went for the crab-in-iceberg spring roll thing. An excess of iceberg in both cases but they looked fine. I picked the huge hunk of T-bone that I wanted (if I had gone for sirloin or fillet then he would have cut it to order), Catherine picked the monkfish on a lemongrass skewer with a sorrel sauce. All of the other fish can be cooked whatever way you like but obviously they have some standard recipes.

The waitresses were very very friendly and chatty and both mentioned that they were students. But the owners really need to do some work on the overall efficiency and accuracy of the service. Over the three courses, every person working there including the guy manning the display and the maitre'd served our table. Yet despite having all of those people attending to us, Catherine's sauce was forgotten, no refills were offered on any of the side dishes and we were asked twice what wine we wanted. Clearly it is early days but I don't see the point of the headsets if they cannot co-ordinate themselves better.

The starters were simple but good. I do have a huge aversion to iceberg but the idea of relying on good ingredients worked well. My steak was a lovely hunk of meat but was slightly overdone. Considering there was only a few tables occupied, they need to do better there. Catherine's monkfish really needed the sauce as it was too dry on its own.

The idea of the same side dishes with everything is neat and is obviously a big help to the kitchen but I question having monkfish, mashed spud and frites. They also make a big deal about the gravy which was excellent and they provided a little dish of two mustards and horseradish. Despite all of that I would prefer bearnaise with the steak. 

I just had ice-cream for dessert which was lovely. Catherine had chocolate pud which was way too dry and needed some of my ice-cream. Coffee was from a standard filter machine and refills were offered. Freshly made and good quality. The bill came to €86 incl one glass of red wine and two sparkling waters. I think this is too pricey and may cause them problems with filling the place at night. Clearly good ingredients cost money but it does look like they are over-staffed for the level of business they are doing.

I really love what these people are trying to achieve, but I see two big problems in the current setup. The first is the room; as I said, I hate it. They have to do something to warm the look of it up. Maybe mats under each table or even 1970's mats on the walls. Those floor tiles are just awful. I am sure a full re-fit would cost too much but the feel of the place is just wrong. Until it becomes a warm, comfy, welcoming place to eat, they will always have a problem.

The second problem has to do with the confused message they are sending. I was expecting somewhere laid back, relaxed with maybe even some booths where the emphasis was on great simple food, friendly service and being somewhere people liked to hang out. They nearly have it right with the food but they have mixed this with piano music, a formal dining setup and just being ""too quiet"". 

In particular, the style of music on the piano is totally wrong. Maybe they should think about something more bluesy or jazzy (but dear god, not jazz). Some Ray Charles tunes or something with some energy. In fact, I think that that is the thing I was missing on the night: energy. Back to the words buzz and atmos.

I don't think I have ever said this about a restaurant, but I think they need to head down-market and try to attract a younger (but not teenage) customer base. It looks like that is what they do for lunch or at least I hope so based on the menu.

I will definitely be back and I do want to try it out at lunchtime, but I am concerned that they may not last hugely long in their current format. I am sure they will start tweaking it as they go forward and see what works and what doesn't. As long as they keep the focus on the ingredients then they will always have my support. I would encourage you to try it out because their approach to food is exactly what is needed in the mid-range Irish restaurant scene.

One note on all my restaurant reviews: I am just an average joe who likes his food. I am not a writer or food expert and I have no experience in the food or catering industry. This is not the review section of the Irish Times. So if the owner of any place I review disagrees with anything I ever say, please feel free to add a comment. I think it could really be of benefit to us all. And don't be shy about it, I am not into flame-wars or doing character assassinations. My aim is to have as many high-quality good value restaurants on my doorstep as possible.

Bandon Summerfest,The Bandon.ie crew have [the full skinny](http://www.bandon.ie/blogspot/2007/07/bandon-summer-fest-updated-timetable.html) and there is [a dedicated site](http://www.bandonsummerfest.com/) too. August 1st to 6th. Check it.
Bandon to Derry  - Nearly Mizen to Malin,"We finally did it. Up to Derry to visit the Pierce's. On the way up we over-nighted with Mary in Cavan and then arrived at Saturday lunchtime. Incredible location looking out over the Foyle. Great weekend.

On Sunday we braced ourselves for the return journey. There were three options - some bizarre route via Tuam suggested by AAIreland, via Dublin suggested by Eoin or back the way we came via Cavan.

We plumped for the latter but I'd be interested in hearing if anyone has other suggestions. We did Derry-Lifford-Strabane-Omage-Enniskillen-Belturbet-Cavan-Athlone-Roscrea-Cashel-Cork-Bandon. With two shortish pit-stops in Cavan and Fermoy, it took the guts of 8 hours to do it.

The N62-N55 backbone through Ireland is the main route from deep south to far north. Maybe it's time to consider the first Motorway that does not head towards Dublin? In some places, it is so narrow that trucks have to come to almost a full stop in order to pass each other.

Barbecue is a noun,"I could be a cynical smartass and say that the people [in this movie](http://www.barbecueisanoun.com/) look a little too close to Christopher Guest's character in ""Best in Show"" but it really looks like a wonderful movie about people who are passionate about Barbeque/Barbecue. 

The horror that we perform in Ireland is what they call grilling (or more accurately ""incineration""). What these guys do takes hours and hours and hours. I've eaten the result in Texas - they should have Michelin stars. Some day I'll try the Carolinas version.

Check [out some of the video clips](http://www.barbecueisanoun.com/clips.htm).

Bat Advice,"That has to be the strangest blogpost title I've ever used.

We arrived back from our much-needed and many-years-delayed holiday to France yesterday (long blog post to follow soon on that). A few hours later Catherine picked up a j-cloth in the kitchen sink to find......a bat!

It was absolutely tiny, barely bigger than my thumb and we had no idea what to do with it. I gently picked it up with a cloth (are they disease carriers?) and brought it outside down to the far corner of the garden. It made no attempt to fly but just slowly crawled across the patio.

A few hours later I was feeling bad about it and went in search. I found it half way up the back wall hanging upside-down. My worry was that some of the horrible local crows might eat it. So I nudged it onto a stick (squeamish huh?) and carried it to our shed. I gently put the stick up against the corner of the roof and it climbed into a nook. Happily for it, there was a spider there. I think it's now an ex-spider.

This afternoon, I went for a look and discovered it was still there, well hidden in the nook, which was a relief.

But is that it? Do I leave it alone? Is it a small breed or a baby? Might it be hurt? Are they rare? What is their natural habitat? And most importantly of all, how the hell did it get into our sink? Down the chimney? All thoughts and pointers appreciated.

Here's a wee pic of the little guy in his current lodgings:

Bawstan Bound,"A week in Massachusetts from 9th-14th. Staying in Framingham, working in Hopkinton. I was in Boston once in 1996 whilst I was working in Silicon Valley and I met up with Catherine there. Great place. Felt small even tho it wasn't. Brass Monkey weather in November. Looks like it isn't too cold there now. I've already Google Mapped my way from the hotel to CompUSA, Toys R Us, Best Buy and Baby Gap. A couple of forays to Walgreens and maybe a sports store and I'll be sated for another six months."
Beach Top Tips,"<div style=""clear: both"" />As a good husband, I am empathising with my pregnant wife by attempting to grow a belly as big as hers. So far, it has been a resounding success. However, it does pose issues of aesthetics when heading to the beach for what is likely to be the only hot day this year that we had last Sunday.

Myself and the three squirts headed off to the Long Strand in Castlefreke/Rathbarry (how could they get rid of such a hilarious name for a village and replace it with something so insipid?). We did our own rendition of Dudley Moore in ""10"" by hopping across the sand shouting ""ooh, ooh, hot hot hot, sand too hot"" and plonked ourselves down for the afternoon.

The aforementioned belly was doing a fine job as a wind-break and sun-shade for my darling daughter. Any potential for slight self-consciousness disappeared when I realised I had placed us between an auld pair and a grossly obese woman. So with zero effort, I managed to look both youthful and slim. My top tip for sun-bathing in Cork.

I won't ruin it all by mentioning my burnt slap-head.

Benny's Brilliant Web SMS Applet,"Ben has just launched a very simple looking but really useful utility over at [Freewebtexts](http://www.freewebtexts.com/ie/vod/). It is a front end to Vodafone Ireland's web-text facility  (other vendors coming) . If you have ever used Voda's site, you'll know that it was clearly designed by someone who hates people and wouldn't know a standard if it came up and head-butted them (web mail that doesn't work behind many corporate firewalls. What century is this?).

Ben's applet is a paragon of simple effective functionality. Check it out and let him know what you think. He'll be adding functionality to it on a regular basis. And no, he doesn't want people telling him to re-write it as an Ajax app using ROR.

Best In Show,"<div style=""clear: both"" />Forget 100K for Celebrity Love Island; Oscar finally got the 10 Euro for his first place in Juniors/Seniors writing in the Bandon Show. The following is an  exceprt from his winning entry:""Pine nut, which is a nut, but it's also the name of a town. Pistachio nut. Red pistachio nut. Natural, all natural white pistachio nut.""

This balanced his unfortunate lack of awards at the Crossmahon Sports day yesterday. The competition in the Senior Infants category was just too tough and his mid-placing in both running and muscial chairs may have scarred him for life.

To make matter worse, Oisín had a cruciate ligament injury in the tiny tots running category and had to withdraw half-way to receive emergency fizzy cola bottle treatment.

Despite the lack of a prizes for bouncy castle bouncing, Sibéal put in a world-class showing and was rewarded with burger-bites and a swig of rola-cola.

And for the second weekend in succession, we shall not mention Conor's burnt slap-head.

BEST....MOVIE....IDEA....EVER And in Bandon!,"Catherine FitzMaurice from [Kilbrogan House](http://www.kilbrogan.com) just contacted me about an awesome night that is happening as part of the Engage Arts festival over the weekend of Sep 25th.

They are showing the 1925 version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with, and this is the genius bit, live organ accompaniment by Dr Eric Sweeney who is head of Music at Waterford School of Technology. Not only that, but they are showing it in a church. The atmosphere should be amazing!

![phantom of the opera poster template copy](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/phantom-of-the-opera-poster-template-copy-209x300.jpg ""phantom of the opera poster template copy"")

It's on in St Peter's Church, Bandon on  Friday, 25th September at  9pm. The film runs for 90mins. Tickets are only €10 and I think they are going to sell out well before time. Call the office on 087-1205022 or Film Society on 086-3689939.

Births and Deaths,"<div style=""clear: both"" />The first 3 years of this blog consisted almost entirely of baby announcements for my friends. I guess to be consistent it should also let friends know about those who have passed away. It is obviously a bit clueless to claim that the internet (and blogs in particular) democratises the news but I have to admit that I only buy a newspaper now on Friday, Saturday and Sunday - Friday for the jobs section, Saturday for the food/property section in De Paper and Sunday for the TV bit of the Sunday Times. I use various Irish Blogs and the RTE news feed for everything else.

Over the past few years I have found The irish Times becoming more and more unbearable where at this stage it has disappeared entirely up it's own arse. I used to think newspapers were for news, now I realise they are just paper blogs from those who aren't qualified to do anything else.

This was particularly driven home a few years back when my father-in-law, Brian, died. This was a man who, as County Manager of Cavan, transformed the county. Once a back-water with the biggest potholes in Ireland, under his direction it became the model for how a county could drive forward providing employment, quality of life and cultural pursuits for all sections of society so that it became the most dynamic in the country.

Brian had something so often missing in Public Servants - he had vision. And to back that vision up, he had a will of iron and a big thick Redhills neck! His sudden death shocked many people and it is wonderful to see that the new library will be named after him.

Johnny and the team in the Celt obviously did a fantastic job on the obituary for Brian. And what did the obituary in the Irish Times say about this symbol of Irish achievement in Public Administration ? Nothing! They obviously couldn't fit him in when they had to laud the life of some cultural icon like the Curator of Bee Poetry at the University of Reykjavik.

Unless the IT and other other totally self-referential papers like it somehow manage to make themselves relevant to the lives of more than a tiny sub-section of Irish/Dublin society, I predict they will have disappeared before the end of the decade.

Blog Moved to Blacknight,"8 years after I first registered conoroneill.com, this blog is finally hosted in Ireland where it belongs. Based on all the great feedback I heard about [Blacknight](http://www.blacknight.ie/) and the fact that they are great supporters of the Irish tech startup community, I went with them.

We're on the SOHO package with is just €35 per year ex-VAT and it does everything I need. The move was extremely easy to do. I just copied all the Wordpress files off the old host, copied the Wordpress Database, loaded both up on Blacknight and told GoDaddy that the blog is now there.

All in all, maybe an hours work including email account setup? The one glitch I had was solved by their support people in less than 10 minutes. The blog feels a lot faster, I hope it's the same for you.

Full review coming soon once I've poked around a bit but so far it's 5/5\. If you are thinking of setting up a blog, go for their blogger package and you'll be up and running with close to zero effort or knowledge.

p.s. if you didn't see a bunch of posts from the past two weeks, that's my fault. Should be working ok now."
Blog Now available via RSS,"You can now subscribe to the RSS feed for this blog. For the life of me I can't think why but hey, it's there if you've nothing better to read. Use: [http://conoro.blogspot.com/atom.xml

Blog post of the year,"When the [Irish Blog Awards](http://www.awards.ie/) nominations open early next year, I'm pretty sure Ivan McCutcheon's recent post [about local West Cork abbatoirs and butchers](http://foodculturewestcork.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/local-abbatoirs-whats-at-steak/) will be the one I pick.

If you care about the food you put in your gob and appreciate the work of people with a passion for their craft, read Ivan's piece, print it off and give it to those you know.

For so many reasons, it is imperative that businesses like Dan Maloney's in Bandon survive and thrive. Supporting local food production is good for community, business, the environment and the economic independence of the country."
Blog Theme Upgraded to Connections Reloaded v1.5,"This site runs on the Wordpress blogging platform and uses a ""Theme"" called Connections Reloaded. The theme defines the look and feel of the site. Ajay D'Souza, the creator of this great theme, has just released v1.5 and I have upgraded to that. So far I have spotted no problems and I like all of the improvements. Still have to get my head around these new Wordpress Widgets.

Bloglines vs FeedonFeeds,"So I've been using an RSS Aggregator called [FeedonFeeds](http://feedonfeeds.com/) for a long time now. The reason I've always liked it is that it is server based and caches the data in a MySQL DB. I have it installed on the Fedora box at home and can connect to it via the DSL connection from anywhere. So I have one centralised location for all my feeds. The caching is also handy as I found a lot of the older aggregators would only cache the titles and not any of the content, and for sites that turnover their RSS links quickly, a lot of the items used to be gone by the time I'd try to read them. But it ain't very pretty and as I've added a lot of feeds recently, the lack of grouping is killing me. 

I searched around a bit and found [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/). Did a quick export-import of the OPML file and was up and running in no time. After a few days use, I'm nearly a convert. Groupings work brilliantly and I have now discovered the joy of a ClipBlog (always wondered what the hell Scoble was talking about). Mine is [here](http://www.bloglines.com/blog/bandon1). I think it also lists all of my feeds. Obviously it doesn't include links to Iguana Fetish Monthly but everything else should be there. Gosh this WorldWideInterWeb thingy is jolly useful isn't it?

Now what I would like is a free RSS Aggregator that uses the Web-Services provided by Bloglines so I have a nice client side tool accessing the server-side data. I know [FeedDemon ](http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/) does it but that costs. Anyone?"
Blogs for Dummies,"Actually it's a great tutorial on how to use Bloglines to track RSS feeds of peoples blogs. I have converted fully over to Bloglines for managing my feeds but they still have a lot of improving to do on the actual blog feature. Blogger is still far better for running your own Blog.

[Using Bloglines](http://preetamrai.com/weblog/archives/2005/04/25/bloglines-how-to-keep-track-of-hundreds-of-blogs-and-some-news-and-some-podcasts-and-some-flickrs-photos-etc-etc/)"
Blogspot Move,"So I finally moved over to Blogspot so that publishing of this is now trivial and doesn't require an
ftp server somewhere. Hopefully this means I'll post news more often. Also looking at MSN Spaces but I'll stick with this for the time being. Tons of bits and pieces which I haven't reported on over the past few months; new niece Rachel, new house in Old Chapel, Argolon work expanding nicely, waistline not expanding but not shrinking, and no christmas shopping done yet."
"Bobby Walls, a life enjoyed","On June 9th, my uncle Bobby Walls, passed away suddenly. He had been suffering from cardiomyopathy for several years and left us too young at the age of 56.

I probably hadn't seen Bobby since the last funeral I attended in Ratoath. The line about Irish families only meeting at baptisms, weddings and funerals is so true. However, as with all my uncles and aunts, I was incredibly fond of him, having spent many summers in my Granny's house as a kid.

Bobby led a simple life. He loved his family, horses, having his few pints, local sport, Man United and laughing. For many years he worked in Woodpark Stud. I remember my mum telling me that he worked in an office until my Grandad died because Grandad wanted him to have more opportunities than he had. But horses and the outdoors were his love and the draw was obviously too strong.

Bobby lived in the house at the junction of Glascairn lane and Fairyhouse Road with his two brothers Frank and Martin. Since my Granny died, he ran the house and made sure that my uncle Martin, who has been crippled by mental illness for many years, was ok.

He died just as he was about to head off and watch one of the syndicate horses run in Roscommon. As the priest put it, in a line Bobby would have loved, ""I believe it is still running"".

The funeral for this man who never married, never had kids and lived in the same house most of his life was packed. So many people wanted to carry his coffin, we had to do it in relays down to the graveyard. The overwhelming upset of my younger cousins reminded me of how much Bobby was loved.

I've been meaning to write about him since the day he passed. What finally got me to do it was the death of [Randy Pausch](http://download.srv.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/) the other day. For those of you unfamiliar with Randy, he was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer last year and given 6 months to live. He gave a ""final lecture"" to his students at CMU which has become famous and resulted in a great book too. If you or your family is dealing with mortality, this life-affirming talk may prove to be great comfort to you. Randy's talk is about living not dying.

{{< youtube ji5_MqicxSo >}}

I cannot think of two less similar people than Bobby and Randy but so much of what Randy said applied to my uncle. Most importantly of all:

""We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand"".

Anthony ""Bobby"" Walls, RIP."
Bons baby blogging bonanza begins,"Arrived 8am. Gel applied 10,30\. Some contractions. Tired. Wife fine. Doc figures we'll be done by afternoon. Gut says quite soon. Tens discarded.

Boom Bang a Bang Banger,"Sadly, attempt #2 at sausage making was not a big success. Not quite Null Points but definitely at the Norwegian end of the Eurovision chipolta contest.

I actually did it a few weeks ago for the parents coming over for brunch but I'm only getting around to blogging it now.

I defrosted the meat that I had not used the last time and spent a hell of a long time on preparation. In anticipation of the Kenwood making me cry like a small girl, I diced up all the meat ultra fine (along with the top of my thumb).

[![IMG_1653](http://static.flickr.com/31/67556857_7d4674f305_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/67556857/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Pretty much the same mix as the last time with more pepper and more herbs. This time I decided to go for the smaller chipolata-style sheep casing. I ran the mix through the Kenwood mincer attachment twice on the roughest setting but the bastarding thing still jammed once. I am nearly ready to bin that P.O.S. It also didn't fill the casing as well as the last time either.

To just make it perfect, I could not find my nice cotton string and ended up unravelling a piece of orange washing line and using that to string them up. I'm sure all the best deli's will be switching over to day-glo polypropylene as soon as they read this.

As my lovely wife and kids were in the house, the shower was out of the question as a curing area. So I hung them in the shed, in the full expectation that some rat would run off with them during the night.

Luckily they were unmolested the following morning and I set them over a very gentle heat to cook up for a late brunch. Several of them burst but I wasn't that bothered as I find that most of Martin Carey's competition winning sossies do the same.

And they were fine but nothing to write a blog about ;-) I thought they were too dry, which my Da agreed with.  I think I need to crank up the fat content in a big way and get proper pork shoulder instead of generic diced pork to go with the pork belly. Maybe less breadcrumbs too. But the spicing was better than the last time and I liked the white pepper kick off them.

I'm not giving up yet but I really need advice on what the problem with the Kenwood mincer attachment is. Do I have a  bad un or am I missing something obvious.

I just received a fabulous book called  ""[Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393058298/qid%3D1134119157/026-4052923-1600400)"". If you have any interest in sausages, smoked foods, salamis, dried ham or any preserved meats, buy this book. It is a masterpiece. Hell, even if you never intend trying to make anything, it is just a great read. I'll do a full review soon but what kills me about the book is that they made 90% of the things in it using a standard mincer attachment on a KitchenAid. Are they really that much better than a Kenwood?

I've just been checking the flickr pictures and it looks like I took none of the completed sausages. Grrrr.

Two and a half years after leaving, I have finally left the building. To celebrate getting rid of me, we had my bye bye meal in Boqueria Tapas in Cork City the other night. I have heard nothing but good things about it since I've been down here. Finally I had the opportunity and a bunch of us headed in quite early on a Wednesday night.

I was well surprised to see that it was hopping mid-week. A very good sign. I was a bit late (projectile vomiting baby emergency) and luckily Christian already had a bottle of Rioja on the go. The world's least sexy name for a wine: ""Muriel"". But it was a fine bit of booze as the three bottles between 3.5 people proved.

There was a lot of discussion and tooing-and-froing on the menu as most of the gang had never had tapas or any kind of Spanish food. The menu was split simply between hot and cold with most dishes averaging between €6 and €12.

I was aiming to do the ""proper"" thing and order one item at a time interspersed with copious amounts of booze. But most people were in Irish mode and ordered the equivalent of ""starter"" and ""main"". I thought it was a pity the waitress wasn't giving us guidance. The big advantage of ""one at a time"" for beginners like us is that you can see what other people are getting and can then decide to have that yourself for the next round.

Patatas Bravas seemed to be the dish of choice for the night and all seemed to like it. I started off with a plate of charcuteria. What came out was a big plate laden down with meat. I was a bit shocked by the size of it but it was an awesome dish. Serrano, salami, chorizo, grapes, manchego cheese and membrillo. The latter two were new to me but W had lived in San Sebastian for two years and explained that membrillo is a quince paste and is famous for going well with manchego. He wasn't joking, both were fantastic. Martin didn't know about chorizo so I showed him the two different types on the plate. Or as Marion put it ""small......far away"". 

The place itself is beautiful with lots of dark wood and has the bar at the front with shelves full of spanish food products. The rear has more seating but is long and narrow and not really suited to a crowd our size. I felt sorry for the waitresses having to force their way through all night. Service was fine considering how many of us there were but there were some big gaps between waitress appearances at the table.

My second plate was Albondigas which are Spanish meatballs. These were bloody gorgeous and I scoffed the lot in no time. Portion size again was quite large.

Due to the large portions, most people stopped at two which was a pity. I think they should reduce the plate size by half which would give us the opportunity to try twice as many things. Throwing weight-loss to the wind I went for number three but it didn't work for me. It was chickpeas with sultanas, parsley and garlic. And that was literally what I got on a plate. A bit too much like eating muesli for my liking but nothing inherently wrong with it.

From talking to people, Boqueria seems to be used a lot by those going to the cinema / theatre / stock-car racing who just want a quick bite to eat and a glass of wine beforehand and for that it is perfect. As a result it is probably not a romantic location to ""impress the bird"" unless the bird is a foodie. If we are in the city sans les enfants (some time around 2025) we'll definitely be going again but I doubt we'd head all the way in on a whim. For whims we have [Davida Tapas in Bandon](http://conoroneill.com/2006/01/30/davida-tapas-bar-reason-enough-to-stop-in-bandon/) which does a smaller menu but is probably as good.

With W's guidance, two days later we went to The English Market and got Manchego and membrillo. Yum tiddley um tum tum.

To celebrate getting rid of me, we had my bye bye meal in Boqueria Tapas in Cork City the other night. I have heard nothing but good things about it since I've been down here. Finally I had the opportunity and a bunch of us headed in quite early on a Wednesday night.

I was well surprised to see that it was hopping mid-week. A very good sign. I was a bit late (projectile vomiting baby emergency) and luckily Christian already had a bottle of Rioja on the go. The world's least sexy name for a wine:  Muriel . But it was a fine bit of booze as the three bottles between 3.5 people proved.

There was a lot of discussion and tooing-and-froing on the menu as most of the gang had never had tapas or any kind of Spanish food. The menu was split simply between hot and cold with most dishes averaging between €6 and €12.

I was aiming to do the  proper  thing and order one item at a time interspersed with copious amounts of booze. But most people were in Irish mode and ordered the equivalent of  starter  and  main . I thought it was a pity the waitress wasn't giving us guidance. The big advantage of  one at a time  for beginners like us is that you can see what other people are getting and can then decide to have that yourself for the next round.

Patatas Bravas seemed to be the dish of choice for the night and all seemed to like it. I started off with a plate of charcuteria. What came out was a big plate laden down with meat. I was a bit shocked by the size of it but it was an awesome dish. Serrano, salami, chorizo, grapes, manchego cheese and membrillo. The latter two were new to me but W had lived in San Sebastian for two years and explained that membrillo is a quince paste and is famous for going well with manchego. He wasn't joking, both were fantastic. Martin didn't know about chorizo so I showed him the two different types on the plate. Or as Marion put it  small......far away . 

The place itself is beautiful with lots of dark wood and has the bar at the front with shelves full of spanish food products. The rear has more seating but is long and narrow and not really suited to a crowd our size. I felt sorry for the waitresses having to force their way through all night. Service was fine considering how many of us there were but there were some big gaps between waitress appearances at the table.

My second plate was Albondigas which are Spanish meatballs. These were bloody gorgeous and I scoffed the lot in no time. Portion size again was quite large.

Due to the large portions, most people stopped at two which was a pity. I think they should reduce the plate size by half which would give us the opportunity to try twice as many things. Throwing weight-loss to the wind I went for number three but it didn't work for me. It was chickpeas with sultanas, parsley and garlic. And that was literally what I got on a plate.

Both Drinkin' and Bloggin'  in it,"Guinness has a blog. All the skinny at [gapingvoid](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/002249.html).

Looks like a pretty decent attempt at a corporate blog. They have a posting about [great Guinness ads](http://www.guinnessblog.co.uk/blogs/guinnessblog/archive/2006/02/13/17.aspx). One thing I've always hated about their web-site is that if you want to see their genius US ads instead of their dire ""meaningful"" Irish ones, you have to pretend to be in the US when signing in on the home page. Boys, dump the swimming across the Atlantic crap and give us ""Brilliant!"" over here please.

Brand and Quality,"[Clonakilty Black Pudding](http://www.clonakiltyblackpudding.ie/) is rightly famous and many people were saddened by the passing of Edward Twomey who made it into a formidable brand. Over the years they have diversified a bit and I see their sausages almost everywhere. We've tended to buy them as our ""standard"" saturday sausage when supermerket buying (going more with Caherbeg or Gubbeen for a treat).

This morning I spotted an extra sticker on the pack and initially had to giggle ""This product does not contain Colour Red 2g (E128)......It contains Colour (Carmine E120)"". Then I thought ""what the hell is food colouring doing in a sausage?"". Surely pork, pork fat, rusk and seasoning is all that is needed in a quality banger?

So I looked at the ingredients and got depressed. 53% meat! That's worse than most discount ""value"" bangers in a supermarket. It continued ""E221 preservative, E621 flavour enhancer, E120 colour, Spice extract, Antioxidant E301""

A quick decode via Google gives: E221=Sodium Sulphite, E621=Monosodium Glutamate, E120=Cochineal, E301=Sodium Ascorbate. You think MSG in a sausage is bad, wait until you see this. Wonder why the E128 that they were using was replaced with E120?

> Following safety concerns raised by EFSA in its opinion of 5 July 2007 [2], the European Commission has prepared a draft Regulation to suspend use of E128 as a food colouring. This proposed course of action was unanimously approved by European Union Member States at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health (Section Toxicological Safety of the Food Chain) on 20 July 2007

Now that I think about it, I normally associate ""red"" sausages with cheap and nasty. I was just led astray by the good name in this case. I hate seeing great brands ruined by a race for volume. We'll be looking more closely at our sausage purchases from now on."

Bringing the carnage to the Dublin Marathon 2016,"Four years ago I ran my first marathon, in Dublin, and it was a disaster. Everything seized up at the top of my right calf around mile 10, followed a few miles later by my left calf. I hobbled the remaining 16 miles in pain. It had never happened before and it hasn't happened since. 

I thought that was the end of my marathon ""career"" and reverted to Halves and 10k's until last year. I finally got the confidence up again and did both Tralee and London. This year was a bit nuts with Manchester, Lakes of Killarney, Cork and Berlin. But at the back of my mind I wanted to do Dublin again and get revenge for the 2012 horror.

Did it go well? Too bloody right it did! Not only did I get revenge, I got PBs for 15k, 10 Miles, 20k, Half Marathon, 30k *and* Marathon. I'm bloody chuffed. 


{{< youtube Km7o3w2fs5Y >}}
&nbsp;

Everything went right for me. I ran faster than planned for 10 miles then collapsed in speed as I always do. But a few faster ones in the middle and an very solid finish, despite walking all of Milltown, Clonskeagh and Roebuck, was enough to give me the result I wanted.  Yeah yeah, I run barely above the pace of a walker, but I'm happy.

* I'd like to thank the following:
  * All of our family and friends who came out to shout. It's an incredibly powerful motivator to see people you know.
  * Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Tommy Ramone for getting me through the [last 3 miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGgfHZ02I2k)
  * Andy from [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) whose calming dulcet tones popped into my mind several times during the hard bits. 
  * [Jim Walmsley](https://twitter.com/walmsley172?lang=en) whose interview on [Ginger Runner Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t33Zi7Pe-jk) kept going around in my head. He said he'd bring the carnage to Western States next year. I turned that into a little personal mantra of ""I'm bringing the carnage"". Of course in my case it was carnage on my body :-) But it really worked. Along with 26 miles of me telling myself ""I've got this"".

Couple of notes:

* The atmosphere before, during and after is wonderful
* The newer route is much better. I didn't mind the Phoenix Park this time at all.
* Drinks stations worked perfectly for me. Faultless.
* Like Cork, generic dance music seemed to work better for me than podcasts for the bulk of the race
* Whoever told the German runner I met that Dublin is as flat as Berlin is an evil person :-) When I told the poor guy going up Milltown that the two worst hills were still to come, he was very very unhappy
* The supporters were fantastic as always. More bands like Berlin and London would be good tho.
* I had far more chats than usual due to my Berlin Marathon running top. It's a great conversation starter for others.
* They need to rearrange the bag drop-off. Despite our hotel being 5 mins from the start line, I think we walked 2+ miles going to/from bag-drop
* RTE is a laughable embarassment. Did RTE Sport hide under their desks for the day, as we ran past their offices? Rather than live broadcasting the largest single mass participatory sporting event in the country and the fourth largest marathon in Europe? If RTE doesn't think that's public service broadcasting then it should be shutdown and give us all our money back.
* The Marathon should forget about the RTE dinosaurs and arrange live streaming themselves like UTMB does. Thousands of people watched UTMB this year and that's a tiny niche race compared to Dublin. With the right global promotion, Dublin could be a huge online media event.


If you are thinking about your first marathon or first Irish marathon, you should seriously consider Dublin. Yes, it's very hilly compared to Berlin, London or Manchester. But it's easier than many and the crowds really are superb.

Broadband is back,"If you live anywhere in the Cork/Waterford/Tipp area and have fixed line broadband with any provider then you may have been having problems since last Friday. I was getting 40 kbs instead of 2 mbs since Monday rendering the internet connection almost useless. Eircom fixed it for their customers yesterday and fixed it for their competitors this morning. Normal service should have returned everywhere. Yet another reason for us all to switch over to Wimax and HSDPA wireless broadband when it gets rolled out rather than using a set of providers who clearly couldn't give a damn.

UPDATE 1: Cancel that, it's gone down again."
"Buffalo Wings, mmm tasty but not so hot","I've made a few half-hearted attempts at doing chicken wings over the years. Usually in the oven and usually burnt beyond all recognition. I now realise that you add the sauce afterwards as anything with sugar will burn.

Recently I spotted a bunch of blog postings about buffalo wings (mainly related to the Superbowl I think) and decided I wanted to try and do them properly. I've always found people raving about Elephant & Castle chicken wings to be a bit weird. I've had them, they're fine but they are chicken offcuts in hot sauce, get a grip.

The simple recipe [given on Slashfood](http://www.slashfood.com/2006/02/02/aint-no-thing-like-a-chicken-wing/) seemed to fit the bill. I found a great site in the UK called [Chilli World](http://www.chilliworld.com/) who stock Frank's Red Hot Sauce. This is the ""original"" hot sauce used for Buffalo wings. I ordered a few bottles of that plus some other Caribbean hot sauces and some spices. They arrived within the week.

So on Monday, after buying 30 chicken wings in the English market for €2.10 (no, I don't want to know where they came from), I made my first real batch of buffalo wings. I fried them in about an inch of oil in a pan (rather than going the full deep-fat frying route) and then coated them thoroughly in the mix of butter, Frank's Red Hot Sauce and cider vinegar as quoted by Slashfood.

Well Frank's sauce may be tasty and red but it ain't hot. I ended up dousing each wing in the sauce from the bottle to get any sort of kick. Hell, I could put the sauce straight on to my tongue and it did not burn. I also question the butter. is it just to make the sauce adhere more? I dunno. What I do know is that they were damned tasty and I had 10 for lunch.

Next time I'll try one of those Caribbean scotch bonnet pepper sauces and see if that works better/hotter.

Can someone do a margin analysis on buffalo wings for me? What are we talking? 1000%? Whoever came up with them has one sharp business mind.

For fans of ""My Name is Earl"", the exchange between the main characters on chicken wings this week was comedy perfection. Dammit these guys can write:

**[Randy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0839486/)**: You takin' Pops' hot dogs outta Camden County is like taking chicken out of Syracuse.
**[Earl](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005134/)**: It's Buffalo, Randy.
**[Randy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0839486/)**: No, I'm pretty sure it's chicken, Earl.
**[Joy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005326/)**: Yeah, it's chicken. Hot chicken!

Burger Innovation in Ireland,"One of the best foodie blogs out there is[ A Hamburger Today](http://www.ahamburgertoday.com/). The writing is top class and the enthusiasm for the food shines through. 

But it has got me thinking about the complete lack of burger variety in this country. There seems to the only three categories here - Mickey D's Style (incl Burger King, Super Macs etc), Chippers (insert your local chipper name here) and diners (Eddie Rockets being the only example I can think of). 

You'll never get a surprise in either of the first two and unfortunately Eddie Rockets ingredient quality plummetted as the chain expanded. I think there is a definite opportunity for someone doing something unique ""in this space"" (oh god, I've been working for a large corporation for too long). What I'm thinking of is a really great unusual signature burger that people go out of their way to get their hands on. 

I was amazed to discover that an entire category of burgers existed which were unbeknownst to be - sliders. These are mini-burgers where you are usually given a few per order and they just slide right down your throat. White Castle seems to be the most famous vendor of these. I need to check out [Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle](http://www.haroldandkumar.com/) for this (renamed to ""Harold and Kumar Get The Munchies"" over here cos we've never heard of White Castle).

That's just one option - even going for unusual toppings or different buns might do the trick. The yanks seems to go on about potato rolls a lot but I have no idea what they are. What I do know is that your standard chipper bundy with generic frozen beef patty can definitely be improved on without costing the earth.

It can be done and I have seen it work; I'll never forget the kebab shop just down from the Portobello pub on the canal which I frequented many a friday night in the early 90's. These guys had chicken, peppers and onions on skewers over a charcoal barbeque. They then slid that into a pitta with the best chilli sauce ever, topped with salad and garlic sauce. Heaven in a pitta. I don't know why they shut up shop, they always seemed jammed to me. And yet Abrakebabra is still in business.......

Are the people of Bandon ready for this or is it more a City Centre Pana thing or should it be set up near to some other food-joint where the desperate-for-something-to-give-them-an-identity mid-twenties wannbees might hang out like Wagamama?

Or would it just be a flash in the pan (rimshot please maestro)?"

Burgertastic,"Burger Blogs seem to be appearing everywhere but this guy [Two-Twenty](http://www.two-twenty.net/archives/000378.html) is an animal!

It turns out that Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles restaurant does burgers too. Bourdain became famous because of his book ""Kitchen Confidential"" which gave the low-down on the high-jinks in a restaurant kitchen. A great read.

His ""Cook's Tour"" follow-up was less hyped but also a very good read. The associated TV series was pretty poor.

His ""Les Halles Cookbook"" is fabulous but I've only read about a quarter of it so far. Tonight I'm checking for his burger recipe. The burger reviewed by Two-Twenty has me drooling at 8.30am. Burger, Fois Gras, Black Truffle, Red-Wine Sauce............

C103 loses the plot,"You don't need to be an economist to know that media companies are suffering hugely in this recession. Their reliance on advertising makes them incredibly sensitive to downturns.

When you have a radio show that addresses a focused engaged specific audience, you would think that it would be a gift both for the broadcaster and those advertising to that audience. Thus C103's [decision to axe](http://quentingargan.com/2009/04/13/c103-to-axe-west-cork-today/) David Young's ""West Cork Today"" programme frankly boggles the mind.

[![](http://www3.c103.ie/images/generic/c103-logo.gif ""C103"")](http://www.c103.ie/)

Radio broadcast licences have been a goldmine for companies like UTV over the past few years. But at the first sign of a downturn, it looks like they take the short term view and run for the hills? With those licences come legally binding terms and conditions.  Perhaps the BCI would like to use this case as an example to Comreg on how a regulator should actually conduct itself.

Having said all of that, the idea of one company having the sole rights to broadcast to a particular niche or geography belongs in the 20th century. The internet makes a mockery of this partitioning. If C103 is  unwilling to meet its customers' needs then the customer needs to take back control.

I'll be honest, I rarely listen to ""live"" radio any more. I download podcasts and music in which I am interested and then listen whilst driving with them playing back to my Lidl car stereo. Everything from food to technology to politics. Many of them are actually radio shows, mainly BBC Radio 4 and 5\. I'd happily pay for a daily or weekly roundup of local West Cork information that I could listen to when it suited me, not the broadcaster.

How many of David Young's listeners would be willing to pay maybe €3 a month to subscribe to an internet version of his show (and other West Cork programming)? Both live-streamed and available for download to iPods, mobile phones or PCs? Of course traditional broadcast is the most efficient way to get to the maximum number of people but needs must when the devil vomits into your kettle (to quote Edmund Blackadder)."

As a traditional meat and two meat kind of guy (see my recent [Meatapalooza tour of Austin, Tx](http://conoroneill.com/2006/01/18/salt-lick-bbq-driftwood-texas-can-i-have-a-franchise-please/)), I've always been in two minds about going to Cafe Paradiso. On the one hand, everyone raves about the food, on the other, I need my dead animal products. It is one of those places about which I kept saying ""I must, I must"" but I never did, despite sending plenty of other people there to eat!

Last night there was a slow food event involving a movie in the Kino followed by supper in Cafe Paradiso. I signed up last week but as the day approached we realised the night was going to be far too long for Catherine who suffers very badly from tiredness in the initial phases of pregnancy. On top of that, I was wrecked from filling a skip with garden rubbish. So we decided to give the movie a miss and just re-book the restaurant for 7pm.

It's a fairly small place with cafe style decor rather than a formal fine-dining (to use an American phrase) setup. The staff had been very friendly in my dealings with them when originally booking and re-booking and that continued for the night. Only two other tables were occupied but that may have been due to the imminent slow food supper.

The menu looked great even if I had to change the way I usually read one from ""which meat am I in the mood for?"" to ""which combo of flavours really does it for me?"". Whilst we were figuring it out, we got a small basket of breads which were bursting with taste.

As I mentioned in the comments on my posting about pregnancy and cheese, there were a lot of dishes with cheese in them and we had to get the young waiter lad to find out which ones were pasteurised and which weren't. The [Knockalara sheeps cheese](http://www.irishcheese.ie/CHEESE_DESCRIPTION/Cheese_Description/Knockalara.html) was ok so Catherine had a fantastic ""tartlet of caramelised red onion, pinenuts & Knockalara sheeps milk cheese with watercress pesto and olive-crushed potato"". She demolished it and thought it was fantastic. I had ""vegetable sushi with pickled ginger, wasabi and a dipping sauce, and tempura of aubergine & cauliflower"". Utterly brilliant. I do love my wasabi and the sushi with the pickled ginger was just awesome. Tempura can often be dodgy but this was light as a feather. A perfect perfect plate of food.

In white wine I am very boring. I am a longterm member of the ABC club (except for really good Chablis) and a lifetime member of the NBSB club (nothing but Sauvignon Blanc). The very odd time I'll have Riesling or Pinot Grigio or even Gewurztraminer. Throwing safety to the wind, I went with half a bottle of Loosen Riesling. Wow. On the first mouthful I thought there was something seriously wrong with it, there was so much happening in my mouth. What sort of devillish mixture have they created to get so much taste into an itty-bitty bottle of wine? I'll be searching that out again very soon. 

And then we had the mains. Catherine went with ""eggroll pancake of leeks & spinach with oyster mushrooms in cider cream, and a crushed potato, parsnip & wild rice cake"" which looked fantastic, had a great sauce which I tried and she loved the whole thing.

I went with ""watercress, red onion & pinenut risotto with Desmond cheese, tomato-basil broth and panfried fresh artichokes"". This was superb, the mix of flavours was really stunning with each ingredient identifiable but working together and I loved the artichoke on the side. However, I do take issue with calling it a risotto. It was made with risotto rice but was totally non-creamy. My guess is that it was cooked like normal rice and then the ingredients added after afterwards. As I said, it tasted fab but didn't have the expected texture. 

Most of the desserts sounded awesome and Catherine went for a dark chocolate dessert with coffee ice-cream and ginger sauce (exact description missing off their web-site). She thought it would be too heavy and initially found the flavours a bit too strong but the trooper that she is, she persevered and funnily enough she cleaned the plate.

After dithering for ages I went for ""ginger-poached rhubarb with a set vanilla custard
and orange shortbread "". It tickled every bud on my tongue. Coffees were spot on too.

This is a chef at the top of his game. We were blown away by how he managed to pack so much flavour into every dish. Whilst we were eating, a diner was settling up and I heard her pass comment about the potential for them to be called ""best vegetarian restaurant in Europe"". It sounded like this was more than her just passing her opinion. I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if they do get such an award.

The total for an almost perfect meal? €108\. An incredible bargain. Do yourself a favour and have a meal there.

On the one hand, everyone raves about the food, on the other, I need my dead animal products. It is one of those places about which I kept saying  I must, I must  but I never did, despite sending plenty of other people there to eat!

Last night there was a slow food event involving a movie in the Kino followed by supper in Cafe Paradiso. I signed up last week but as the day approached we realised the night was going to be far too long for Catherine who suffers very badly from tiredness in the initial phases of pregnancy. On top of that, I was wrecked from filling a skip with garden rubbish. So we decided to give the movie a miss and just re-book the restaurant for 7pm.

It's a fairly small place with cafe style decor rather than a formal fine-dining (to use an American phrase) setup. The staff had been very friendly in my dealings with them when originally booking and re-booking and that continued for the night. Only two other tables were occupied but that may have been due to the imminent slow food supper.

The menu looked great even if I had to change the way I usually read one from  which meat am I in the mood for?  to  which combo of flavours really does it for me? . Whilst we were figuring it out, we got a small basket of breads which were bursting with taste.

As I mentioned in the comments on my posting about pregnancy and cheese, there were a lot of dishes with cheese in them and we had to get the young waiter lad to find out which ones were pasteurised and which weren't. The &lt;a href= http://www.irishcheese.ie/CHEESE_DESCRIPTION/Cheese_Description/Knockalara.html &gt;Knockalara sheeps cheese&lt;/a&gt; was ok so Catherine had a fantastic  tartlet of caramelised red onion, pinenuts and Knockalara sheeps milk cheese with watercress pesto and olive-crushed potato . She demolished it and thought it was fantastic. I had  vegetable sushi with pickled ginger, wasabi and a dipping sauce, and tempura of aubergine and cauliflower . Utterly brilliant. I do love my wasabi and the sushi with the pickled ginger was just awesome. Tempura can often be dodgy but this was light as a feather. A perfect perfect plate of food.

In white wine I am very boring. I am a longterm member of the ABC club (except for really good Chablis) and a lifetime member of the NBSB club (nothing but Sauvignon Blanc). The very odd time I'll have Riesling or Pinot Grigio or even Gewurztraminer. Throwing safety to the wind, I went with half a bottle of Loosen Riesling. Wow. On the first mouthful I thought there was something seriously wrong with it, there was so much happening in my mouth. What sort of devillish mixture have they created to get so much taste into an itty-bitty bottle of wine? I'll be searching that out again very soon. 

And then we had the mains. Catherine went with  eggroll pancake of leeks and spinach with oyster mushrooms in cider cream, and a crushed potato, parsnip and wild rice cake  which looked fantastic, had a great sauce which I tried and she loved the whole thing.

I went with  watercress, red onion and pinenut risotto with Desmond cheese, tomato-basil broth and panfried fresh artichokes . This was superb, the mix of flavours was really stunning with each ingredient identifiable but working together and I loved the artichoke on the side. However, I do take issue with calling it a risotto. It was made with risotto rice but was totally non-creamy. My guess is that it was cooked like normal rice and then the ingredients added after afterwards. As I said, it tasted fab but didn't have the expected texture. 

Most of the desserts sounded awesome and Catherine went for a dark chocolate dessert with coffee ice-cream and ginger sauce (exact description missing off their web-site). She thought it would be too heavy and initially found the flavours a bit too strong but the trooper that she is, she persevered and funnily enough she cleaned the plate.

After dithering for ages I went for  ginger-poached rhubarb with a set vanilla custard
and orange shortbread  . It tickled every bud on my tongue. Coffees were spot on too.

This is a chef at the top of his game. We were blown away by how he managed to pack so much flavour into every dish. Whilst we were eating, a diner was settling up and I heard her pass comment about the potential for them to be called  best vegetarian restaurant in Europe . It sounded like this was more than her just passing her opinion. I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if they do get such an award.

The total for an almost perfect meal? €108\. An incredible bargain. Do yourself a favour and have a meal there.

Capital Cousin Chloe,"A wee bit delayed, we are tickled pink to announce the birth of Chloe Sheila Johnston on June 30th in the Coombe to Louise and Kieran. The little darling weighed in at 6lbs 15oz, so our young fella should be easily able to bully her. 

Kieran has decided to forego a property development empire to set up a hedge fund trading in pampers futures. It appears there is far more money to be made in nappies. Hopefully we'll see them soon so she can meet her country cousins and demand the presence of a translator.

Whilst we are at it - big congrats to Kieran on being made partner. The little pup."
Car Sharing coming to Cork,"Michael Newham just left a comment [on my post about car-sharing](http://conoroneill.com/2007/03/22/car-sharing-in-cork-city/#comment-101146). It looks like this is going to happen next year. It's a great idea.

> Our company ‘Mendes - GoCar’ will be providing the car-sharing service in Cork City Centre. We hope to have it operational by May the 1st 2008.
> 
> Please see [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_sharing) for a good overview of what Car-Sharing is about.
> 
> All our ‘GoCars’ will have dedicated parking spaces ‘GoBases’ near high residential and business nodes of population.
> 
> Research has shown that in a successful car-sharing business each car added to a car sharing fleet replaces 8 to 12 private vehicles; thus reducing Co2 emmissions and congestion.
> 
> Another benefit to joining a car-sharing service is the increased use of public transport as well as walking and cycling.
> 
> We hope to have our website [www.gocar.ie](http://www.gocar.ie/) live by mid January. It will just be a brochure based site to begin with where ye can leave contact details to find out about membership and so forth."
Car Sharing in Cork City,"Got an email from Cork GreenMap telling me about a new feasibility study that Cork City Council are doing in the area of Car Sharing.

> Cork City Council is considering the feasibility of the setting up of a car-sharing service – also called “car club” in the UK – in Cork City:

> 
> What is car-sharing?
> Car-sharing in urban areas is a cost-effective alternative to owning your own car. It allows people access to a car when they need it, from a place near their home or workplace. The car can be used for short trips lasting as little as an hour or booked for a few days. You only pay for the hours you keep the car and the distance you drive. NB: the term “car-sharing” is also used to designate the sharing of a ride.
> 
> Who can be members of a car-sharing club?
> Members of a car club can be both individuals who don’t need a car on a daily basis and companies/organisations looking for mobility solutions to tackle parking, traffic or car-pooling issues on their site in Cork City.
> 
> What are the advantages of car-sharing?
> The advantages of car-sharing are numerous: 
> 
> *   Affordable: just pay for the time the car is in use and the distance driven
> *   Reserved parking: cars are conveniently located in reserved places close to where you live or work
> *   Flexible: book a car for as little as an hour, on-line or calling a booking centre
> *   Easy to use: after registration you just book it, jump in the car and drive away
> *   Planet-friendly: car-sharing globally reduces parking pressure and car use, helping to combat pollution and climate change
> 
> Tell us what you think! 
> 
> A feasibility study is being carried out on behalf of Cork City Council and a public consultation stage is now on track to assess the potential market of such a service as well as to define the best locations of a car club in the city centre.

Looks like Cork is turning into the San Fran of Ireland in more ways than one! I hope this idea takes off."
Carrigfadda Hill and Warrenscourt Forest are two brilliant running spots in West Cork,"A few months back I was browsing the [Coillte Outdoors site](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/home/) for forests in West Cork that looked good for running in. The two most promising ones I found were [Warrenscourt Forest](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/index.php?id=171&rec_site=56) and [Carrigfadda Hill](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/index.php?id=173&rec_site=138&trail=217).

## Warrenscourt
I've done Warrenscourt Forest twice and I highly recommend it. You can access it from either the Warrenscourt end or Kilmurry end and both are very short drives off the N22 near Lissarda. Whilst it's quite steep in places, it's very runnable with some beautiful views along by the stream. 

![Warrenscourt 4](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-17%2010.54.44.jpg)

The only disappointment is that two nearby lakes are on private property. They would really add to the experience. It's mostly dog walkers at the weekend but I've met a couple of runners too. The dog walkers appear to be illiterate, based on most of their dogs being off the leash, despite the large signs. 

![Warrenscourt 1](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-17%2010.57.44.jpg)

The Warrenscourt entrance is [here on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/mfjVU4rXb8q). The Kilmurry one is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/mct9ewePFJH2). And the direct link to the [Coillte map PDF](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/uploads/tx_r3coillterecreationsites/Warrenscourt.pdf) is here.

![Warrenscourt 2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0108_100752_002.JPG)

If you need somewhere to crank out the miles in loops away from traffic and with a slight ""trail"" feel to it, I highly recommend Warrenscourt.

![Warrenscourt 3](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-17%2010.41.54.jpg)

## Carrigfadda
Carrigfadda is a different kettle of fish entirely. It's difficult to even Google it, as there is another one near Skibbereen. This one is near Reenascreena and is down some very small back roads. 

![Carrigfadda 1](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-21%2015.28.01.jpg)

Eventually you come across a lone church in the middle of nowhere. It's best to park there. 

![Carrigfadda 2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_143821_007.JPG)

You have to run a few yards up an open road and then head up a lane which becomes more and more unpaved. You follow that to an open area near a farmhouse and then the real fun begins.

![Carrigfadda 3](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_144629_004.JPG)

The steps seem to go on forever. Even if you are just walking, it's hard work. 

![Carrigfadda 4](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/steps.jpg)

Finally you get a breather in the forest itself (a featureless generic monoculture pine plantation) but the steepness starts soon again. Did I mention the mud? So much mud. Lovely mud.

![Carrigfadda 8](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_145610_005.JPG)

You'll start to see a concrete holy cross peeking out and suddenly you're nearly at the top. 

![Carrigfadda 9](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_150427_016.JPG)


You lift your head and pow, holy crap, the views. A genuine gasp out-loud moment. I spent ages here and at the cross taking photos and videos and panoramas. The fog and rain initially masked the fact that you can see the Altantic from here. The wind turbines seemed scarily close and are a complete eyesore. The sooner we move all this stuff offshore, the better for everyone. 

![Carrigfadda 10](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-21%2014.59.34.jpg)
&nbsp;
![Carrigfadda 11](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-21%2014.59.19.jpg)

&nbsp;

I then started the descent. Slightly further down is a mysterious monolith (ok ok, it turns out to be a [trigonometric station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_station)). 

![Carrigfadda 5](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_0321_151547_002.JPG)

Then I pegged it back down as far as the steps, slipping and sliding everywhere, and finally made it back to the car. Only 2.5 miles all-in but it felt like 10 with over 1000ft of elevation change.

I had another look at the map in the church car park and there are some other small spur routes I could have taken to extend the run. Next time.

I want to do lots more trail and mountain running in the next 12 months and I think I've found the perfect training ground!

Here's a link to [my Strava trace](https://www.strava.com/activities/908926017) for my exact route. There's also a lovely description of the [Hill walk here](http://corkhillwalks.blogspot.ie/2014/04/carrigfadda-looped-walk-over-high-hill.html).

Carrigfadda Church is [here on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/hgodSvv7SJ32). And the direct link to the [Coillte map PDF](http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/uploads/tx_r3coillterecreationsites/carrigfadda_01.pdf) is here.

p.s. does anyone know what has happened to Duke's Wood near Bandon on the way to Crookstown? It used to be a recreation area but it looks like they are cutting the whole thing down. The lack of any public forests near Bandon is a real let-down. However I must check out the tiny one beside Innishannon."
Casio UK Service dreadful,"I bought a nice Casio Waveceptor watch about 18 months ago from a great discount online store in Wales called [The Time Zone](http://www.discount-watches.co.uk/). It's a combined analogue/digital job and syncs the time using those big transmitters scattered around Europe.

The watch worked fine for a few months and then the analogue bit started losing hours and hours. I returned it to Casio UK who replaced the battery and sent it back. In no time at all the problem returned. I sent it back again and they replaced much of the innards. All was well for another few months and then it started losing time again!

I sent it back last week with a statement that I wanted a replacement watch since it was either flawed by design or by manufacture. It was returned this morning with a note saying they could find nothing wrong. Here we are 2 hours later and it has already lost an hour!!

Maybe as part of their ""extensive testing"" they should put it on someone's wrist for half an hour.

What the hell do I have to do to get this bloody watch fixed? And yes, it is still under warranty.

It's probably cost me as much again in postage every time I return it. For the moment, all I can say is avoid Casio Waveceptor watches like the plague. Catherine got a cheap digital Casio at the same time as me and apart from a battery change has worked perfectly since.

Cast Your Vote over on boards.ie,"I love the mock election thing they are running over on [boards.ie](http://www.boards.ie/vote/). Basically you can input your voting preferences for your constituency and see what the patterns are like already. Cork South West has only had 142 votes so far and it'd be great to see more to get a better sample set. It would be also good to get as wide a demographic as possible voting rather than the usual boards.ie users.

Please don't abuse it, they are watching out for that.

[Current stats for CSW](http://www.boards.ie/vote/results.php?c_id=8) are very interesting. I'd be very surprised if they match the outcome assuming that the number of remote mountain farmers on boards.ie is pretty small!

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/csw.jpg ""Cork South West"")](http://www.boards.ie/vote/results.php?c_id=8)"
Castlefreke is exactly why all State lands must be immediately be removed from the hands of logging company Coillte,"Let's get straight to the point. [Coillte](https://www.coillte.ie/) is a logging company with a commercial mandate. Having it in charge of 440,000 hectares of state lands is so idiotically Irish, you don't know whether to laugh or cry. All state lands should be transferred to a hugely expanded and reformulated [National Parks and Wildlife Service](https://www.npws.ie/) immediately. The NPWS can then licence Coillte to plant and harvest trees in a strictly controlled fashion on a limited subset of those lands. Clear-felling must be banned and all planting must be of mixed species.

State lands belong to the Irish people. I'm not going to suddenly become a rabid republican but we have enough history here to make any attempt to sell-off Castlefreke Woods deeply offensive to most people.

![Castlefreke](/images/2018/06/20180527_132348.jpg)

The revelation that the owners of Castlefreke want to buy the woods from Coillte is no surprise. What is completely unacceptable is that this is a ""discussion"" at all. The answer must always be no. Always.

In fact, if Coillte wants to discuss anything with the owners of the castle, it should be to offer to buy all of their lands.

The area around Castlefreke is a gem of a resource for the people of West Cork. It is one of the only places you can walk and run safely for miles, in the woods, paths, lanes, beaches and roads. You can go from the end of Quay road in Rosscarbery to Galley Head with some of the best views in the world. The idea that a family or company gets to take some of that from us is ridiculous.

A few more examples of Coillte in action:

Last weekend I decided to finally check out Duke's Wood near Bandon on the Crookstown Road. When we first moved here, it had a big Coillte sign and picnic tables. They have gone or rotted away and Coillte has clear-felled a huge part of it. Signs everywhere say Keep Out. In the best Irish tradition I ignored the signs and went exploring. Despite all the briars and disgraceful clear-felling, there is still a wonderful little wood here on both sides of the road. A small amount of investment would make this an amazing walking, running and leisure location. With a 25 year plan, it could be re-planted with native species and deliver long term benefits to the area. Instead I'm sure they'll just clearfell the rest of it. Because they are a logging company.

![Dukes Woods](/images/2018/06/YDXJ0865.JPG)

Similarly the woods in Kilmurry/Warrenscourt, whilst not the prettiest, are still a great place to have a walk and run in safety. But of course, their only real function is to generate revenue for Coillte and the State. So they are in the process of being clear-felled too. I'm just waiting for the day they decide to go after Dromkeen.

Update 1: I've just learned on Facebook that the lovely (albeit steep) Carrigfadda is now closed to the Irish people too. Is Coillte intent on getting rid of every safely walkable part of West Cork? How much revenue is even generated by clear-felling a wood as tiny as Carrigfadda?

(Sidebar: In Bandon, pedestrians and runners still can't get safely to the Clare O'Leary Walk. Meanwhile, how much money was spent landscaping bloody roundabouts in Halfway and at the airport?)

Two years ago I wrote a very long piece on called ""[The Walkist Manifesto - From Greenways to pathways everywhere and the future of Ireland's health](https://conoroneill.com/2016/09/21/greenways-byways-hedgerows-tourism-and-the-future-of-irelands-health/)"". If anything, I've become even more convinced that this country is broken.

**It boils down to this - What are the values of this country?**

What sort of country do we want to give our kids and grandkids? One that has nice roundabouts and a few extra logging Euro in the government coffers? Or one where everyone has free access to an amazing outdoors filled with clean rivers/lakes, native forests, greenways, rights-of-way and an entire landscape they can embrace without ever having to obesely get in a car?

Oh and BTW, that latter country will generate far more revenue via tourism/recreation than Coillte ever has.

Castlefreke is just a symptom of a broken system. If any local politician wants to be remembered for decades to come, they need to lead the change to fix the root cause.

Categories vs Tags,"I've been using Wordpress Categories as sort of generic Technorati tags. When I remember, I add some post-specific actual tags. I haven't really been that clear on the difference to be honest. 

[Lorelle has a big posting on it](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/09/categories-versus-tags-whats-the-difference-and-which-one/). And I'm still confused! 

Top-tip: Don't try reading anything technical after spending your lunchtime installing Oracle and testing ETL tools. Maybe I shouldn't try setting up an automated backup of a subversion repository this afternoon after all.

I think I'll just continue to make it up as I go along on this tagging mularky (malarky, malarchi, mullerky???)"
"CBBC, CBeebies and UTV on Sky Digital","I don't know why it is so hard to find this info so I thought I'd post it here to solve that problem.

A lot of Sky customers don't know that there are many other free channels accessible on the various Astra satellites (like the good old analogue days) which you can programme into your Sky Digibox. From talking to other parents, by far the most popular of these has to be CBBC and CBeebies. In fact, Channel 4 is now the only remaining mainstream station that you cannot get on Sky in Ireland.

In order to get the two kiddies stations, do the following:

*   On your Sky remote, go to Services-&gt;System Setup-&gt;Add Channels
*   In the Frequency box, enter 10773
*   In the Polarisation box, select H
*   In the Symbol Rate box, select 22
*   In the FEC box, select 5/6
*   Select ""Find Channels""
*   It will return a list of BBC Channels including CBBC and CBeebies
*   Scroll down to each one of interest and press the yellow button to select them
*   When you are done press the ""Select"" button
*   Those channels are now available in Services-&gt;Other Channels
Unfortunately you cannot record those stations if you have a Sky+ box. There are more regional BBC stations available at ""Freq=10802"" (with all other settings the same as above).

UTV can be found on: Freq=10906, Pol=V, Symb=22, FEC=5/6

[Lyngsat](http://www.lyngsat.com/astra2d.html), the best satellite info web-site has tons of others.

Channel 4 gets it right this time,"""The Simpsons"" is voted the best kids programme of all time.

And someone just said that it's the best TV show of all time. Ye know, they might be right.

Nice to see ""The Muppet Show"" and ""Danger Mouse"" do so well.

But ""Bagpuss""? Never liked that show. Nothing ever bloody happened.

And a huge relief that they had ""The Tomorrow People"". For years I thought I had dreamt that show!

Ah, nostalgia.

Anyone got a MIDI of the theme music to ""Play Away""? Might make a good ring tone. As a small child, I thought Brian Cant was god."
Charity photography exhibit in Mallow,"Via [Donncha](http://ocaoimh.ie/2007/09/06/charity-photography-exhibit-starts-today/) - Mallow Camera Club will be exhibiting a number of photos in Mallow Town Library for three weeks starting yesterday.

One of the Club’s members, Sean Riordan, is heading out to South Africa shortly as part of a group from the Niall Mellon Township Trust helping to build homes for the poor in that country. All the photos on exhibit will be for sale with all profits going to help fund Sean’s trip and the good work he’ll do in November.

This is a very worthy cause so if you can make it at all, please head up there and buy some pictures."

Check out the new bandon.ie site,"Brilliant job by Andrew Kingston of [Arkutech.ie](http://arkutech.ie) in building the new[ bandon.ie](http://www.bandon.ie/) site.

A quick poke around confirmed that it is built on the same fantastic Wordpress foundation as this fine blog.

A certain person named [Donncha O'Caoimh](http://ocaoimh.ie/) is one of the main developers of [Wordpress ](http://www.wordpress.org/)and just lives a few miles away in Blarney. Bandon is clearly commited to buying local. OK Wordpress is free but you get my point!

The site is now much easier for Trevor and the crew to update regularly and most importantly of all, the site now has comments. This might seem a small thing to you but the importance of giving people the ability to have their voice heard online about local issues should never be underestimated.

The site is  a superb local community resource, so head on over right away and check out [the new site](http://www.bandon.ie). **And leave a comment there!**

p.s. if you are a Twitter user and want to keep abreast of updates on the new Bandon site, just follow [@bandon](http://twitter.com/bandon) there and it'll automatically post a link any time there is a update."
Ciarán and Heathers Wedding - Superb,"It's not often I comment on a wedding but last weekends wedding of Ciarán and Heather was absolutely brilliant. From the lovely church in Tinahely to the beautifal location for the reception in Ballybeg House to the phenomenal catering, great crowd, top atmosphere and razor sharp speeches, we all left with huge grins on our faces.
Of course I'm now getting flashbacks of the picture shown by Eoin O'B of Ciarán in First Year Eng with his German 'tache. Shudder.
And they organised the whole thing in 3 months! Both looked stunning and the wicklow air meant no hangover the following morning.
CandT survived baby-sitting our three monsters for the night. A very successful weeekend all in all.
And Mark _did_ look like a vet, no matter what he says."

"CoComment - Dubious at first, now a big fan","The ability to search and find information in blog comments has been identified by many ""in the know"" as one of the bigger challenges in blogland in 2006\. But I have a simpler problem - tracking replies to my comments on other peoples blogs. Those who use Wordpress and the ""Subscribe to Comments"" plug-in like me allow commenters to get e-mails when replies are posted. Unfortunately, we are in the minority.

The other day, [CoComment](http://www.cocomment.com/) was launched to great buzz. Initially I was dubious - why would I go to yet another web-site to find out about replies to things I have written on someones blog? But I was in a hard-of-thinking mode. These guys provide an RSS Feed of replies to your comments.

For non-techies reading this, it means that you have a pseudo-blog which you track in your blog reader (Thunderbird, Bloglines, Rojo etc) and which consists an aggregation of other peoples replies to your comments on yet other peoples blogs.

Once I realised this, I signed up, and now I just click a button in my browser every time I have written a comment. I can then completely forget about what I have written until someone replies and it appears as a new item in my blog reader. Most excellent. This means they can store all of these comments, which means comments will effectively become searchable. Are they going to offer this themselves or wire into Technorati or even Google?
It is invitation-only right now but there are plenty of nice people handing out those invites so it should be easy enough to get sorted.

The Columbia OutDry Extreme Mesh is the running jacket I've been dreaming of,"For someone who runs a lot in bad weather, I've bought very few running jackets since I started back in 2009. But once I started running trails, I had to up my game. They can be summarised as:

* 2009-2017 Various cheap generic windcheaters 
* 2017 - Decathlon heavy running jacket. Not very breathable. Still use it.
* 2018 - The classic Ronhill Infinity Torrent Running Jacket with the chest pocket square. Still great.
* 2018 - Columbia OutDry Extreme. The original heavy one. Completely waterproof but too bulky.
* 2020 - Inov-8 Ultrashell Waterproof Jacket. Extremely light. Doesn't breathe. Barely waterproof. Stitching unravelled.
* 2021 - The North Face Flight Futurelight Jacket. Stupid money. Breathable. Completely useless in rain.

After the disaster of the Futurelight, I was on a mission to find something that was waterproof in Irish weather, light and somewhat breathable. Generally that means you're into the world of high-end Goretex with one exception - Columbia. I've always like the OutDry concept where the membrane is on the outside, so it never wets out, unlike most water resistant/proof jackets. But the older ones were a bit too much like heavy oilskins.

I read some good things about the newer [OutDry Mesh](https://www.columbiasportswear.ie/IE/p/mens-outdry-extreme-mesh-waterproof-shell-jacket-1988551.html) design but the price was eye-watering - €250. So I held off and kept checking various sites for discounts. Finally [SportFits](https://sportfits.eu/shopware.php?sViewport=detail&sArticle=163652) in Germany had it for a good bit under €200 and I jumped at it. I would much prefer < €150, but if I get as many years as I have with the Ron Hill, I won't mind too much. Note that the price changes all the time on these sites so be patient. Unfortunately Columbia never seems to include it in their sales.

![Outdry Extreme Mesh](/images/2023/02/outdry_ex.jpg)

I've worn it on several short to medium runs in rain and one 27 miler where it rained non-stop for several hours on exposed hills. In every case, I was bone-dry underneath. Everything after that is a bonus. It does the one thing I need - it will keep me dry if the going gets rough on the [Kerry Way Ultra](https://kerrywayultra.com/kerry-way-ultra/) in September.

Apart from that key result, I'm happy with every other aspect of the jacket:

* Surprisingly light but not as light as the usual thin Inov-8/Salomon/etc
* Bundles up pretty small
* Nice soft inner lining
* Rain just beads on the outside and then runs off
* Not very breathable but no worse than most
* Good pockets (unlike the idiotic TNF one)
* Good tight hood adjustment (unlike the old one)
* Soft material at mouth
* Velcro straps on wrists (again unlike the idiotic TNF one)

It generally fits true to size and you'll have enough space underneath for a few base/mid layers or one heavy one.

I'm just thrilled I finally found something that ticks all of my boxes for the bad days. 

If your budget can stretch to it, just get it."
Community Variety Show on March 26th in Bandon,"Every year the great people who run the Rosmini centre for adults with an intellectual disability organise a fun and interesting event to promote community integration and inclusion for everyone. This year they are organising a community variety show.

It's on Friday the 26th of March in the GAA Hall in Bandon. Doors opening at 7.15, show starts at 8 sharp. It is not a fund raising event so tickets will be at the very affordable cost of €5 each.

The show will include:

*   A DJ
*   Singing and Music
*   Magic and Tricks (both kids and adults)
*   Bingo
*   Dance and Comedy
*   Raffle
*   Street Dancers
There will be spot prizes between performances.

Sounds like a great fun night for all the family. You should start seeing signs for it around the town soon."
Companies offering summer work in Bandon?,"I just had  a comment on one of my posts from a girl in Coláiste Na Toirbhirte wondering about summer work vacancies in Bandon. If you have any, or know of businesses that take in summer students, maybe post a comment here or drop me a line at conor AT loudervoice DOT com and I'll pass the info on.

Are there any sites that provide some sort of service in Ireland for this? Like a lightweight free irishjobs.com? I'd be happy to host one for nothing if there is opensource software available."
Conor manages to get lost in the Galtees and only realises it later,"One of my favourite sights in Ireland is when I'm driving south on the M8 motorway and the Galtee Mountains appear on the horizon. At certain times of the year and day, it's breathtaking.

The 16yo and I had a fine time out there earlier in the year with [Bandon Hillwalking Club](https://bandonhillwalkingclub.com/) on their Open Day but I wanted to find out how much of it was runnable by someone like me. I see how fast the [IMRA/MMRA](https://www.imra.ie/) guys race around via Strava but of course they are a different species to me :-)

A few weeks back I finally decided to do it.

I'm always concious of being ""that guy"" - the idiot who needs to be rescued off a mountain because he headed off without even a jacket or fully charged phone.

So I go completely overboard even on the easiest routes. Hydration pack, Columbia Outdry Extreme jacket (if it's good enough for Eoin Keith at Barkley, it's good enough for me on a Summer's day in Cork, even if the hood cinches are rubbish), hiking poles, bivvy bag, space blanket, water, food, compass, paper map, multiple offline map apps on my phone, swiss army knife, toilet paper, power bank, whistle. You name it I have it. The only thing I'm missing is a tent, flares and breathing apparatus in case of a once-in-a-lifetime snow storm followed by avalanche. And that's just to walk around the lake in Gougane Barra (kidding kidding. Or am I?)

I parked at the trail head at [Clydagh Bridge](https://osm.org/go/esxIt90p) and checked out the Coillte signs. I chickened out and decided to just do the signposted route up to Lough Curra instead. To find my mountain legs so to speak. 

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day1_01.jpg)

One of my favourite bits is only a few yards long. It's the Lough Curra shortcut. I thought it was going to be some sort of hill-walker in-joke but it was genuinely a shortcut. 

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/loughcurra_shortcut1.jpg)

Basically the lovely [Mountain Meitheal](http://mountainmeitheal.ie/) volunteers created a proper trail where people were already short-cutting. My huge disappointment is that we don't have hundreds of miles of trails like this in Ireland. But then [we're back to my blogpost from 2016](https://conoroneill.com/2016/09/21/greenways-byways-hedgerows-tourism-and-the-future-of-irelands-health/).

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/loughcurra_shortcut2.jpg)

Overall it's a fabulous route with a really great track along a ridge-line you can actually run as a normal person. It mixes forest, very steep fields, tracks and rocky bits. The lake and the surrounding cliffs are very impressive. But it wasn't the nicest day and the cliffs freaked me out a bit. So back I trotted to the car and headed home.

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day1_02.jpg)

Over the next two weeks, I found a few GPS traces on sites like [Wikiloc](https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/galtymore-horseshoe-cush-galtybeg-galtymore-slievecushnabinnia-co-tipperary-15378478) of the Horseshoe Loop around several of the Galtee peaks. They were quoting 5.5+hrs for a hike. So I figured I'd be faster with some light jogging. I loaded up a clockwise loop into [Viewranger](http://www.viewranger.com/en-us) on my phone and re-packed for Everest.

Back to Clydagh Bridge and up Cush I went. Zero running involved. It got steeper and steeper. Then really steep just near the summit. I started getting freaked out. What if I fell? I'd be that guy. ""Stupid fat old dude dies falling down small hill - Killed by the Swiss Army Knife in his pack"".

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day2_01.jpg)


I finally edged around the summit with my poles and started the trot down. Then up Galtybeg I went. Tough but enjoyable. Windy as feck tho, despite the lovely day. And onwards to Galtymore. I was killing it even if not a lot of running was happening. The dry summer meant it wasn't just a relentless quagmire so I was very happy. 

On top of Galtymore, I took a bunch of photos in every direction. The various cliff edges totally freaked me out as much as Cush when with all the wind so I stayed very very far away.

Onwards.

I got to the top of another summit. I came to the conclusion that the default maps on Viewranger had the summits mis-labelled but it was no big deal as I just had to follow the uploaded blue line. After a slight course correction, I headed down that peak. But for some reason I seemed to be making little progress. Another 15 minutes down near another cliff edge and I realised I'd gone badly astray off the mountain and had to circle around the base to get back on track. Which I duly did. I was wrecked and a bit grumpy at this point.

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day2_02.jpg)


I summitted another peak. Weird. I didn't remember there being this many of them on Wikiloc. Onwards to the cliffs above Lough Curra and I knew I was in the home straight.

I wondered why the hell someone would build a wall in the middle of nowhere at the top of a cliff on a mountain. To stop the sheep throwing themselves to their death in despair at EU agricultural policy? The youngfella explained later that evening that it was the Tipperary/Cork border! Oops. But no passport control?

![Image Name](/images/2018/10/galtees_day2_03.jpg)

The final trot down was long but great fun and the Inov-8 XCLAW 275 (sadly no longer made) were amazing all day, dealing with mud/bog, rocks and slippy grass with aplomb.

Into the forest and a final jog to the car. Bloody hell, that took 4:45hrs. So much for being a lot faster than the hikers.

Home I drove and uploaded GPS data and pics to Strava. 

![Strava](/images/2018/10/strava_galtees_01.png)


Hmm, that bit where I went astray looks weird. 

Zoom in. 

![Strava](/images/2018/10/strava_galtees_02.png)


Wait a second. 

Oh you are bleedin' kidding me! 

This genius went:

Cush > Galtybeg > Galtymore > Back to Galtybeg!!!! > Down the wrong side of Galtybeg > Around Galtybeg > Up Galtymore > Down Galtymore > Finish.

Yep, instead of doing a full 360 when taking all my pics on Galtymore, I did a 540!

I still cannot figure out how I made such a n00b error. I was watching the trace on Viewranger most of the time - I now figure that I was so zoomed in, I didn't realise I was following it in the wrong direction coming off Galtymore!

Ignoring my idiotic error, it's a fabulous loop. But I don't think I'd do it in anything but perfect weather as those cliffs are deadly and you could easily go astray in fog. Particularly if you're me.

I now have a [Moscow Thumb Compass, with L baseplate](https://www.all4o.com/moscompass-model-11-universal-orienteering-compass) (or Thumbpass as Jeff in work brilliantly renamed it) in addition to the normal Silva and I'll be using compasses + paper + electronics from now on. Next time I might even run a bit more.

With the weather worsening and the days much shorter, I think that's probably me done with soloing the mountains for 2018 - like I'm some sort of Alex Honold ;-) I'm still a danger to myself on anything but clearly defined trails (and even then....). But I'm looking forward to going harder and faster at them in late Spring 2019."

I used to hate Gary - his cookery programmes were very anal and he always added just one touch too many to every dish. But he is transforming his image over the past few years and his great ability can shine through more now.

I have a ""thing"" about bridges ever since I stood on George Washington Bridge in NY with my cousin Thomas swaying gently and then discovering that it had been built in the 1920's. Since then I've only done Golden Gate (a bit of a let down), Bay Bridge (cool), Severn Bridges (fabulous). But the one I am dying to drive over is [Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge](http://visitbristol.co.uk/site/things_to_do/p_24661) in Bristol. I have driven under it many times and I still wonder how they built it. It says a lot about our joint history that whilst we were scrabbling in the muck for rotting potatoes, they were building wonders like that.

Conor's Roundup of Recent Runs,"I'm not a great one for detailed mile-by-mile race reports so I've bundled a bunch of them together. 

## MCI Marathon Ballina
We joined the [Marathon Club of Ireland](https://marathonclubireland.com/) last year and I've been very impressed by the number of events they organise. They have so many amazing athletes who have done 25, 50, 100 and even 200+ marathons.

On the 25th of February, they arranged 3 Marathons in 2 days in Mayo. We picked the early Saturday one and arrived on Friday evening after a lonnnnng drive from Bandon.

We awoke before dawn and headed up to the local pitch to get our bibs. 61 of us took off in the dark  at 7am. 

Unfortunately, I thought it was going to be mostly forest trails and wore my Altra Lone Peak 3.0 trail runners. In reality, more than half of each of the 5 loops was on the road. My toes were in a rough state by the end but not too bad.

The loop itself was lovely and the views of the river as you ran through the forest were gorgeous. I thought I'd struggle with doing loops but it was fine, particularly on the second-last loop, as I was able to prep myself mentally for the next one. 

![Ballina](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170224_171937.jpg)

I enjoyed mixing in with the parkrun people too.

For the first time ever, I managed to pass my wife and beat her by 30 seconds for a personal best time. Then it was into the clubhouse for sambos and hot drinks.

This is a really great marathon and you should join the MCI to take part in these low-key, inexpensive community events that happen all over the country.

The presentation to the woman who had just done her 50th marathon really touched me. 

The woman who talked to my wife about how she was doing all three marathons over the two days, whilst toing-and-froing from Northern Ireland, blew my mind.

## Kilmacsimon Rowing Club 10k fun run
Absolutely brilliant fun. Lots of hills but nice and short. If you are looking to dip your toe in, give this a try next year.


## Castledonovan Loop in Drimoleague
Oh dear, we really screwed the pooch on this one. 

Drimoleague does a superb job of promoting various [looped walks near the town](https://drimoleaguewalkway.com/the-walks/). Unfortunately most of them are on roads which is a no-no in my book. Speaking of books, [the book](https://drimoleaguewalkway.com/the-book/) with all the detailed info about the routes is as rare as hens teeth and we had to drive to the Centra in Drimoleague to get a copy on the day we wanted to do a run. The Castledonovan Loop seemed ideal since it was only partially on roads and they were very remote.

We drove up some twisty bits for a few minutes and parked just opposite the old broken down castle. Luckily most of the route has the usual arrows on posts. You just have to follow the right colour.

The first part was up some pretty steep roads with only 2 cars encountered and both moving slowly. It was good energetic running. It then switched to a small forest which was exactly the terrain we were seeking. 

Then we got to the ""trail"" bit. Or more accurately the bog bit. When the real fun began. 

![Bog bit](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017_0328_103326_027.JPG)

The day was rainy and foggy and they had lots of signs about not attempting it in bad weather unless you were experienced mountain walkers. We decided to be *those* people who ignore such signs. ""How bad can it be?"" I asked. We had a phone with offline maps, an actual map, the guide book, a compass, rainproofs, water and trail runners. The only bit we were missing was the experience :-) I figured being in the Scouts 35 years ago should have us covered.

We proceeded to stagger through horrendous mucky bog in reasonably thick fog for 1.5 hours. At no point could we run. I realised I was one of those assholes who might need mountain rescue to come get them. But in reality I was able to find each waymarker with no problem. If the fog had come down very thick, it might have been a different story. 

This brilliant sign did make us laugh. Here's an idea - maybe put the grid reference or GPS co-ordinates on a plastic plate so people might know where they actually are.

![Stupid Sign](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017_0328_102722_026.JPG)

Finally we came across a gorgeous lake and then a proper track. We were finally able to start running again and that was great fun. The fog burned off and the views were fabulous. We got back to the car after a full 2 hour loop (the book quoted 4 hours for walking).

I can't recommend this route at all for running unless it dries out massively during the summer. It was the same horrible bog I encountered in Gougane Barra before Christmas. Fine for hiking, rotten for running.

On a positive note, I think my navigation skills came on a long way!

## Ballyhoura and Seefin 
We spent a couple of days with the kids in the lovely [Ballyhoura Forest Luxury Homes](http://www.ballyhouraforestluxuryhomes.com/). The views as you drive in from Mitchelstown are just fabulous. We got a good deal on Pigsback for a big house and really can't fault it. Shops are a few miles away but there is plenty for smaller kids to do on location. They also have decent wifi and Sky TV if the weather is bad.

The 15 yo and I checked out the forest path that leads from the estate. It eventually comes out on the main road which didn't seem to be pedestrian friendly. Another big miss by Cork CoCo. This whole area is a mecca for active tourists, but as always, only cars are considered. As I keep saying over and over: join the dots.

We then drove up to the forest with the [Mountain Biking Centre and Trails](http://visitballyhoura.com/index.php/mountain-biking/) to try out some of the walking trails they had there. Wow what a fantastic setup for mountain bikers! The shorter walking routes were nice but the whole area is more focused on the cyclists.

It seemed a shame to come here and not try something harder. So once again the 15yo and I set out. This time my wife drove us up the back of the mountain biking area until the road became too tough for a non-SUV. We then took off on foot with our maps and compass. He was fully decked out in proper hiking gear, including gaiters. I just had trail running gear with long tights etc. We missed the turn for the ""official route"" and had to double back, but since it was on a forest road it was fine.

As with Drimoleague, then the real fun began. We started the trail up Seefin and immediately the kid sank up to his crotch in the bog. Much laughing ensued. His hiking gear proved a brilliant move as he wasn't wet at all. 

The route remained boggy as hell but more defined than Drimoleague. It then got so bad, they've had to put down ""sleepers"" which basically float on the bog and allow you to get across. The views from the top of Seefin are jaw-dropping. 

![Sleepers](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170401_172108b.jpg)

The route down was much easier on a rocky track and finally we made it to a small road and broke into a trot. This brought us back to the same big road I mentioned before. I didn't feel safe attempting to walk on it, so I called my wife and she collected us.

I was going to say that it's not the best route for running but then I discovered that it makes up part of the [Ballyhoura Marathon](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1229) which was on last weekend! I'm aiming to do at least the half next year, and possibly the full.


## Tramore
As my new employers are HQed in Tramore, I'm spending a lot of time there. I had no idea what a superb running town it is. I've been doing some enjoyable loops starting with the flat promenade, then to the tracks near the back-strand and then up onto the cliff road and up near the Metalman. The mix of flat and hills is ideal and I intend to go further and further afield as time permits.

![Tramore](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170404_073657.jpg)

## Rosslare Strand
There is a lovely route from Ford of Ling down towards Rosslare Strand and all the way down past the driving range to the smaller beach. Part of this makes up the annual Easter 10k but I just love the stretch as you get away from the dense housing area. It's mostly flat and you can do some of it on the beach if you wish. One to remember if you ever want to stretch your legs in Wexford.


## Brighton Marathon
The [Brighton Marathon](http://www.brightonmarathonweekend.co.uk/) was our big race for Q1 2017 and all training was really centred on doing it well. A weight loss of 1.5 stone was a good start in Jan/Feb/March and the switch to Skechers GoRun 5 really helped with my speed. 

The day was predicted to be hot but everyone underestimated just how hot. 21C might not seem too bad to non-Paddies but that is scorching for us. It was the worst runner carnage I've ever seen in my 10 marathons. People were dropping like flies and being carted off by the medics. I made sure to stay very hydrated but by mile twenty I was really suffering with the heat. It didn't help that the low point was down in a horrible industrial estate loop. 

But that's the bad stuff. The good and great is that most of the route is lovely and along the promenade. The support of the locals is amazing. Brighton is just gorgeous. And being able to walk straight into the sea at the end of 26.2 miles is one of life's greatest pleasures.

Despite the heat and my head not being in the game, I still managed personal bests for both the Half Marathon and Full Marathon.

![Brighton](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170410_121123_320.jpg)

Brighton is definitely in the ""one to consider"" category for British marathons. My top tips: [1] Make all your restaurant bookings weeks ahead of time. We struggled to even get pizza. [2] You can get amazing AirBnBs only a few yards from the prom [3] Uber was £40 from Gatwick but was £70 on the way back due to traffic. The train is only £10. [4] We went from 21C to freezing fog in the space of a few hours.

## Dromkeen Woods Innishannon
Whilst [Dromkeen woods](http://www.coillte.ie/site/dromkeen/) have been around since 1740, I only noticed the Coillte sign near the bridge recently. I knew it was tiny but I decided to give it a go last weekend. The main path loop is very short and has two good steep bits. But the real fun is to be had on the upper trail which is knotty and gnarly and all over the place. The bluebells at this time of year are also lovely. Doing all of those bits is only a couple of miles but a few loops would make for a good intense off-road workout. As always, watch out for the morons with their dogs off leashes.

The fact that this forest is standalone and not connected to Kilmacsimon, the Clare O'Leary Walk or Graham Norton Walk really shows the complete lack of vision for active tourism, health and recreation in Cork County Council.

![Dromkeen](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170422_162437.jpg)

## Great Railway Run
We were considering a couple a marathons for last weekend despite it only being 2 weeks since Brighton but some of my shorter runs proved that I still needed more recovery time. Then I read about the [Great Railway Run](http://www.thegreatrailwayrun.com) and figured 25K was very doable. As my buddy Walter said ""it's a very civilised distance"".

The weather conditions were perfect - cool but no rain. We drove to Carrigaline and took the shuttle bus to Centre Park road. For some reason I was nervous at the start line.

The route is just fantastic and I think I'll be using it in future for my training long runs. You obviously follow a lot of the old railway route and you hug the coast for most of it. The first chunk is also part of the Cork Marathon.

Then it's out towards Rochestown and Passage West, on to Raffeen, out towards Ringaskiddy for a bit and then on the back road into Carrigaline.

I found the entire thing mentally very hard despite the flatness but was thrilled to find I'd a new Half Marathon Personal Best! 

Definitely one to put in your diary for next year. 

And as I said in my post about the Cork Marathon last year, I continue to be inspired by the gumption of people shuffling along in their first 5K or 10K. I'm going to go all Facebookey now and do an inspirational quote from the brilliant Pre, Steve Prefontaine. ""A lot of people run a race to see who is fastest. I run to see who has the most guts."" 

## Next
Next up is the [Cork City Marathon](http://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/) and then we have to find a few more to fill the summer befor we get into the usual Autumn and Winter season of races. My guess is there'll be a few MCI ones which will fit the bill. I also want to do my first decent length trail race, ideally 50K.

## Next year
Next year I'm 50. I've decided I want to do 50 by 50. So a 50 miler before May 2018. Now I just need to figure out where, and lose 50 pounds!"

Conor's Top Tips for DNFing The Kerry Way Ultra,"## DNF?
For non-runners reading this, DNF means Did Not Finish. In [my preview post](https://conoroneill.com/2022/09/01/watch-your-first-ultramarathon-online-with-the-kerry-way-ultra/) I ended with ""Let's see how I do. Particularly when the rain comes in at night.""

On the plus side, the rain came in during daylight hours. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's go back to the start.

Nope, nope, let's thank some people first.

## Thank Yous
* Elieen - The woman, the legend. Words like ""community"" and ""culture"" have become overused and devalued. She gives them meaning again. None of us would have had this experience if it wasn't for her.

* All the volunteers - I tip my bucket hat to you all. I hope I can return the favour in the future. Thanks for everything especially the cheers and the smiles. 

* Catherine - I don't know how my wife put up with all my dithering and my demands. And then we got to Kerry :-) She totally disproves the idea that family as crew is a bad idea.

* Fiona - Big sis was ready and waiting for me in Glencar with everything I needed including awesome tea and lots of high energy to get me going quickly.

* Youngfella - I never got his name but he caught up with me after Caherdaniel and lit a fire underneath me by saying we weren't going to make it. I had gotten lazy and was having a rain pity-party at the time. I started motoring for miles after that. I really hope he made it. 

* Seanie - Not just for all the phenomenal work he does for KWU in general but also for getting me running again when he told me I could make it to the finish in time. Even if he was wrong :-)

* Eddie Murphy - For cheering up every single person he encountered despite having the chronic shits for most of the race.

* The informal aid station people before Mastergeehy - What a wonderful surprise. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I left with a skip in my step and a huge grin on my face. 

* Everyone who toed the start line - We were all in this together. Whether you finished or not, your energy helped drive me far beyond anything I have ever done before.

* NPWS and the landowners - KWU can't happen without you. You are creating a long-lasting legacy in Ireland.

* Gav Judge - For mentioning how special running at night can be. A perfectly clear sky over Foilmore made the moon look touchable. And the stars over Caherdaniel were one of the highlights of the race. I also day-hallucinated which was hilarious. That wonderful art installation of carved stone ducks were in fact just random rocks.

* The three sets of people who were sure I was wrong to follow the Yellow Person signs that they were standing beside ;-)

* The people of Kerry! - Thanks for hosting us.

## But why?
I don't have any deep thoughts here. I'm not running away from anything or running towards anything. I never finished Haruki Murakami. If I'm having a mid-life crisis, it's a bit late. I just love running (ok ok jogging) and I love the trails. 

KWU gave me a chance to spend an enormous amount of time out there with my shallow thoughts, enjoying some of the best views on the planet, and sometimes dealing with a bit of temporary discomfort. 

![Derrycunnihy](/images/2022/09/derrycunnihy.jpg)


Seeing how far this old bag of bones can go is also intriguing for me.

I'm much more inspired by the John Kelly view of ultrarunning than the hoo-hah king-of-pain nonsense you sometimes see associated with it. All of the ultrarunners and mountain runners I look up to seem like the most humble normal people who just love running far.

## What I nailed
* Nutrition - Coke, Tea, Sandwiches, Koka noodles or potato salad at the stops with Tailwind/Maurten refill each time. Crisps and emergency Hula Hoops. I highly recommend eating a packet of Hula Hoops as you trip along in torrential rain between Glenbeigh and Foilmore. Mood improver x1000. A few Torq/Gu gels during bad times. I was never hungry but I also never over-ate. Everything vegan, of course.

* Water - I normally chronically underdrink and have had dizzy spells in several races and recces this year. I needed to use a filter bottle in the river before Lough Acoose to top up my hydraflasks and had to pop salt tabs semi-regularly too. It worked!

* Blisters - The thing I was most worried about after badly shredding my feet in a 100km solo recce in July. I taped up each toe and my forefoot with Leukotape-P and Tincture of Benzoin after treating my soles for a week in [Tuf-Foot](https://tuffoot.com/). Blisters only started appearing in the untaped parts of my feet after Waterville. I taped those areas up in Caherdaniel and the problem was solved. Only a few minor surface blisters were there on the Sunday.

* Initial pacing - My plan was to slowly jog the flats and the downs and fast walk the ups. The ballpark target pace was 15-17 minute miles with hopefully some faster ones on the roads and much slower above Foilmore. This worked well to Glenbeigh where I was only a few minutes behind schedule. There were a few reasons for the slow planned pace: 2x bouts of Covid, an ongoing hamstring problem and an inability to string together a proper training plan by stupidly doing Connemarathon, Surf Turf n Tar, Cork City Marathon and Run Killarney Half over the past few months. The hamstring was sore at the start line. By the end, I didn't even notice it. 

* Tiredness - A weird one to mention but I wasn't sleepy even once. I normally get up around 4am so the ""night"" is a bit different for me and not remotely alien. I had been really worried about needing to sleep but when I mentioned it to my wife in Waterville, she asked me if I was sleepy. I wasn't. So what would be the point of trying to sleep. Sure I was tired but never to the point of needing to stop.

## What I screwed up
A few core things were the reason I had to DNF. They were so utterly simple, stupid and easy to avoid. It's infuriating!

* Shoe lockdown - My fear of a blister repeat and a feeling that the Speedgoat 5s were a bit stretchy meant that I did a runners knot on them and cinched the laces down very hard to stop slippage. Never do something new in a long race! Even by Glenbeigh I was feeling discomfort in the tendons on the top of my feet going into my shin. Bit by bit it got worse.
  
* Walking - After Glenbeigh I got lazy and started walking almost all the time. But quickly. I had various excuses for the next few hours like ""wind"", ""rain"" and ""darkness"". This put more pressure on my shins and tendons and by the time I got to Foilmore I needed Voltarol and Ibuprofen. By Waterville they were incredibly sore. And I was now 2 hours behind schedule. By Caherdaniel I was in trouble. By Sneem, both walking and jogging were killing me. 
  
* Gear Change - The plan for Sneem had always been a complete change of clothes/shoes and a freshen up. But time pressure meant that I just switched out the heavy jacket for something lighter and swapped the SpeedGoat 4 GTX for Salomon Ultra Glides. This was despite my wife saying that rain was due. Runners, listen to your crew! I left Sneem refreshed but very sore. The rain started. And got heavier and heavier and heavier as I got to the top of the exposed hills before Blackwater Bridge. The lightweight Inov-8 jacket and Salomon shoes were both saturated in minutes. 
 
Between the leg pain and rain, my speed collapsed and my temperature plummeted. I trudged through the forest before Templenoe, knowing I was done. I had lost the ability to visualise myself at the finish line or even visualise myself in Kenmare. At the spur in the track that went up to the hostel on the N70, I called my wife to come get me. She made sure I was sure. I was. We let Eileen know my race was over and back to Killarney we drove.


## Should I have DNFed?
I have asked myself this question a thousand times. If I had knuckled down, could I have done it? If I had gotten to Templenoe, changed all my clothes, switched back to a heavy jacket and base layers and taken a bunch of painkillers, might I have recovered my pace sufficiently to get to the end (either in time, or at all)?

I'll never know. The only things I do know are that the rain got worse and barely let up for hours. And 6 days later my left leg is still in quite a bit of pain. There's also the small issue of the large red swelling that appeared on my shin and which was diagnosed the following day as cellulitis (bacterial infection of the skin). So I spent the week on antibiotics.

All in all, I think it was the right call for me. (But still.....)

I'm very disappointed I didn't finish whilst simultaneously being over the moon that I covered 150km on foot with only a sore leg to complain about. I'm also chuffed how the rest of my body is in amazing shape after a few days, at the age of 54.

I can't end without mentioning Yvonne Walsh and Eoghan O'Neill. I knew Yvonne was going to podium even if she didn't. Her down-to-earth approach to everything is an inspiration. And Eoghan, holy shit, we all saw that video last year. Now that's a comeback!

## 2023
Hell yes. Training starts as soon as this tendonitis eases off.

## Bonus Content - Crew Stop by Crew Stop
Hopefully this is useful for someone thinking of doing KWU. By the time I got to the start line I had reccied the entire course except for 2 miles before Sneem. I had covered many parts multiple times in recent months, including that one solo 100km recce from Killarney to Waterville. So I wasn't just ready, I knew where all the gotchas were and kept my wits about me not to go off-course. But of course that's impossible if you live abroad. So here's just a few  short descriptions of how I view the course as a back-of-packer.

### Start to Lord Brandon's Cottage
The first section is a doddle (or to use formal language, a piece of piss). From the racecourse on footpaths to the touristy bit of the National Park and up to Torc is easy. There's a a bunch of steep steps at Torc and then you are on to the Old Kenmare Road which varies from gritted path to some lumpy bits. After a few miles you reach a T-Junction. Do *not* go to Kenmare. Make sure you know the names of the main towns/stops. I met one guy who was standing there, not knowing which way to go. Turn right and you'll soon cross the N71 and then have more of the same easy terrain all the way to Lord Brandon's Cottage. The only things you need to worry about are hydration if it's hot, and mozzies.

### Lord Brandon's Cottage to Glencar
This section messes up a lot of people. And if you only recce the initial parts you'll get the wrong idea. Start with mostly uphill roads for a few miles. Then easy off-road. Some light scrambling and steep up/down on rocky terrain before you reach the road again. You think it's going to be road from then on. Oh no no no. After a mile or so, vertical up the side of a mountain to the highest part of the course, followed by steep rough slippy down. I've run out of water twice here. Then a fairly easy but long off-road single-track before you hit the road to Glencar. Any time there are similar signs pointing in two directions, you always want the simpler ""Kerry Way"" direction. So not the ""Walking Route"" or ""XYZ Loop"". 
### Glencar to Glenbeigh
This is one of the easiest sections. A mix of very easy forest paths and roads ending in a very steep slightly lumpy up and down through the Windy Gap.

### Glenbeigh to Foilmore/Rossmore
A very short steep trek through the forest followed by several miles of boring hilly roads. Then my favourite bit of the course. A long fairly steep trek up above the Ring of Kerry. The views on a good day back to Rossbeigh Beach and Inch are some of the best in the world. Unfortunately this was when I hit torrential rain and brick-wall wind. Once you get to the top, it's an easy undulating downhill on old track to the road. A few miles on road followed by a short trip past a bull(!) in a field and you get to Foilmore Community Centre.

### Foilmore/Rossmore to Waterville

The bit I'd dreaded for months. The bit I lost sleep over. The bit I'd effectively done 4 times but was still terrified of. 

A gentle start leads to one of the big splits in the route. You do *not* go to Cahirsiveen in the KWU. That's a spur. You go hard left off-road and up a very steep uphill. Then it's viciously steep up and down on some very nasty terrain for what feels like days. If the weather is bad, this may end your race.

Be incredibly careful with navigation. In my big recce I got turned around in the dark and ended up re-tracing most of my steps back to Foilmore. It nearly broke me. I was so tired, I even convinced myself that I hadn't gone wrong and the Russians had hacked all the GPS satellites.

This time I had a compass/thumbpass and made sure I was always travelling between South and South East. Finally there's a very steep rocky track down into a farm and on to the road for a few miles to Mastergeehy. 

But it's not over.

Make sure you don't miss the turn here as you're about to deal with more awfulness. A very steep track up to Termon's ridge. There's a laughable ""4km"" sign there which some evil person has installed. I think it's more like 14km. This is followed by a few miles of rough ankle-breaking terrain and knife-edge rocks. Then a never-ending but not very rough undulating route all the way to the road into Waterville. it's more mentally hard than physically, particularly if it's heading towards 2am like it was for me.

### Waterville to Caherdaniel
First few miles out of Waterville are on road. Then a nice easy single track which crosses back over the road twice. Stunning views during the day. This is a very mixed route with a very steep up and then undulating downs. Mix of grass, rocks, roads, forest and trails. Tiring but not particularly hard.

### Caherdaniel to Sneem
The first mile out of Caherdaniel is very steep and rocky. Then it spends a few miles on rough but ok terrain. There are a few road sections which your ankles will appreciate. Then a couple of very very steep ups which take it out of you. The downhills are fairly runnable. Eventually you'll come to the main road. Do *not* go out on it. It's very easy to miss the signs pointing down to a track which runs parallel to the road. This is a very easy section. Gentle up and down. Track, road and forest road. Finally a couple of road miles into Sneem.

### Sneem to Templenoe
This is the start of the Lite course. First few miles are a very easy mix of paths, roads and trails. Nothing too steep. Then there's an exposed hill section which is fine in good weather (not so much in bad) followed by a short road section and then down into gorgeous woods at Blackwater Bridge. The views out to the water here on a good day are incredible. This leads to big forest roads almost all the way to Templenoe, with a few hundred metres on the main road.

### Templenoe to Kenmare
This was the hardest section for me in the Lite last year. It's several miles of constantly uphill road. If it's hot, be careful with hydration. Eventually you get to the top and can run hard downhill on the road for quite a while. The off-road sections are relatively easy, if mucky, with one semi-rough rocky patch before Kenmare. Then the road into and through Kenmare.

### Kenmare to Finish
The hill out of Kenmare is a heartbreaker. It's long and steep but at least it's on-road. You get a brief respite and then you are on to the Old Kenmare Road trail and it gets even steeper. You now have a lovely bunch of miles on a great trail. It's wide, often lumpy, not remotely dangerous or particularly exposed and ever changing. And eventually you'll come back to the T-Junction you were on many hours previously. You turn right and head back down into Killarney via Torc and the Park.

## Bonus Content- DNFer Gear
I completely overpacked extra clothes and shoes and food but I'm glad I did. It meant I never worried about not having exactly what I wanted at any crew stop. Here's some of the more important elements along with some of the backup/unused things in the boxes.

</video>

* *Hoka Speedgoat 5* - Initial tests were disappointing as I slid around inside them. Bulkier socks, foot taping and lace lockdown meant they were fantastic from Killarney to Foilmore. Never slipped once.

* *Hoka Speedgoat 4 GTX* - Much heavier than non-GTX but absolutely perfect from Folimore to Sneem. Feet 100% dry the entire way and all of the taping stayed stuck. Never slipped once. Sore on the back of my heel going uphill tho, due to much bulkier heel counter.

* *Salomon Ultraglide* - These were supposed to be the comfy option for me to cruise from Sneem to Killarney. Instead they were used for wading through impromptu streams. I've done a few runs in them and they are good but I don't feel as confident on the slippy stuff in them. 

* *The North Face Futurelight jacket* - I got this for half-price luckily. Fine for light rain and wind. Utterly useless after maybe 30 minutes of medium heavy rain. Don't believe any review that doesn't include bad weather testing. Avoid.

* *Columbia Outdry Extreme jacket* - Borrowed. Fantastic in heavy rain but a bit of a bin-bag when you're sweating. Buying one soon for the bad stuff in 2023.

* *Inov-8 Ultrashell jacket* - Basically a windcheater that can handle drizzle. Might meet minimum standards for races but is really only a backup on short good-weather runs.

* *Petzl Swift RL headlamp* - Incredible beam even on the middle setting. Made the section above Foilmore much much easier. But disappointed with the battery life and it can't take AAAs as a backup. So either pay €50 for a second battery or bring two torches if you are slow like me. It's also disappointingly micro-USB. So I often just bring one USB-C cable with a Garmin adapter and micro-USB adapter with me.

* *Nitecore UT27 headlamp* - This has a rechargeable LiPo battery and can also take AAAs. Two beams (narrow and wide). Good torch but half the lumens of the Petzl so I used it at the start line and towards dawn. However, I can't really recommend it as the hinge clasp is so weak, both sides broke with normal use and it's now held together with duct tape. Despite being under warranty, I have to pay P&P to get it replaced. 

* *Multiple Decathlon baselayers* - All good, particularly the skiing and merino ones.

* *Feetures socks* - Along with Balega, still my favourite socks.

* *Black Diamond Distance Carbon FLZ poles* - One of my all-time best purchases. Light as a feather. 

* *Salomon Adv Skin 12 pack* - There's a reason this is the pack most people were wearing. Cannot fault it, particularly the multiple pole-holding options. I had to watch [Dom Granger's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQASNVEq6aI) to figure that aspect out tho.

* *Salomon soft flasks long neck* - I've had these for a few years. Make sure to get the hard-bottomed ones to make it easier to get them in and out.

* *Salomon 1.5L Bladder* - Fiddly to refill when you're tired but worked perfectly.

* *Ron Hill Hydraflasks long neck* - Went blue in the face trying to get the liquid into my mouth. Terrible. Avoid.

* *Katadyn BeFree Filter 1L* - Has saved my ass multiple times on the trails when I ran out of water. Always bring it with me now. Any stream anywhere and you can safely drink.

* *Patagonia Endless Run Shorts* - I was gutted to discover that my fave Salomon trail shorts are no longer made so I tried the well-reviewed Patagonias recently. Love these. Particularly the big stretchy pockets everywhere for gels etc. Zero chafing after 80km.

* *Odlo Ceramiwarm long tights* - Used these from Foilmore onwards. Warm, tight and comfy. Did the job well.

* *OMM Kamleika waterproof pants* - Nice and stretchy. Easyish to get on but not after 24hrs on the course.

* *Arm Sleeves* - Any brand. Highly recommend these for the start instead of wearing a bunch of warm stuff that you have to stop and remove after a few miles. Also work well as sweat bands on your wrists once you warm up.

* *Garmin Forerunner 955 watch* - Still angry at this. Bought recently to replace 5yr old 935 whose battery had become very poor. It ended the run in Waterville when we plugged the charger in! I switched to basic Trail-run mode and it started announcing every mile at full volume on my phone! So I shut it off. Again don't use anything new unless you've tested it a lot beforehand.

* *Jungle Formula insect repellent* - I got swarmed by thousands of mozzies at Lord Brandon's Cottage. It was freaky. My entire lower legs covered. I still have all the bites. Once I covered myself in Jungle Formula, it didn't happen again.

### Update 1: Ultrarunning doesn't have to be expensive
I'm very aware that my kit list above makes ultrarunning look like an expensive pastime. It absolutely doesn't have to be. Shoes are the one piece of gear where I'd stick with Hoka/Salomon/Saucony/etc. My main money-saving top tip is to keep an eye on running shoe reviews on YouTube to see when new models are coming out. My faves are [Seth James DeMoor](https://www.youtube.com/c/SethDeMoor), [Believe in the Run](https://www.youtube.com/c/Believeintherun), [FOD Runner](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheFODRunner), [Run4Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/c/Run4Adventure) and [The Ginger Runner](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheGingerRunner). You should then be able to nab the older model for huge discounts. I've got plenty of half-price shoes. Ditto massive sales by companies like Nike just after Christmas. But remember that Aoife Mundow won KWU on her first go, wearing road shoes that she got as a prize in a competition! 
 
Ideally tho, buy your first shoes locally if you can, as sizing can sometimes be weird with some brands (looking at you Inov-8). And do not buy from Amazon as there are tons of scammers on there selling shoes. Alltricks in France is great as an online option. And plenty of sports shops around Europe will ship to Ireland inexpensively. UK is obviously problematic now.  

Apart from the shoes, you can get great discounts on other gear from local shops by keeping an eye out. And obviously there is a ton of good quality cheap kit on Decathlon. 

Many of the items I have are not absolutely necessary. e.g. lots of runners don't like poles and a running watch can easily be replaced by your phone. But remember most ultras have a mandatory gear list, so you can't dodge having a jacket with minimum specs etc. And you can't run any IMRA/MMRA race without a waterproof jacket.

As for the races themselves, whilst some have very high entry fees, that does not apply to any IMRA/MMRA race or the KWU itself.

So go on, give it a go. I bet you'll enjoy it."
Conor's ultra secret Chicken Tikka Masala recipe,"Handed down through generations of sufi mystics and carried by the Priory of Sion to Bandon where it remained undiscovered in a secret vault until excavations found the ancient stone etchings, I can now reveal the best chicken tikka masala recipe on the planet.

More accurately, I was given a stocking-filler cookbook by my sister years ago which came with packets of spices. It did lay undiscovered for over five years until I finally used it to make a tikka paste and then used their recipe for chicken tikka. And it really is awesome. Up there with Mumrez Khan's [lamb and spinach karahi](http://www.arax15.dsl.pipex.com/) from ""[Rick Stein's Food Heroes](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rick-Steins-Food-Heroes-Stein/dp/0563521759/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b/202-4581289-2815805?ie=UTF8)"".

The book is called ""Great Curries"" by Manisha Kanani and was published in 1997\. I'd be surprised if you can still get it. Actually I just checked Amazon and someone is trying to sell it for £48! Original RRP was £9.95.

First the tikka paste. I normally make 3x these amounts and put it in a sterilised Tupperware and keep it in the fridge. Easily lasts a month, might even last longer but I always use it up before the month is out. Our regular Friday curry sees to that. I get (or actually Catherine gets) most of our spices in Mr Bells in the English Market. Great value in the big bags. Grinding cumin and coriander seeds is a pain in the ass with a pestle and mortar and doesn't work with the multiquick type blenders so I usually use a coffee grinder and forget to clean it. Mmmmm, cumin coffee.

*   2 tbsp coriander seeds
**   2 tbsp cumin seeds
**   1.5 tbsp garlic powder
**   2 tbsp paprika
**   1 tbsp garam masala
**   1 tbsp ground ginger
**   2 tsp chilli powder
**   .5 tsp turmeric
**   1 tbsp dried mint
**   .25 tsp salt
**   1 tsp lemon juice
**   drops of red and yellow food colouring (I know, I know but it gives you that ""authentic"" UK-style curry colour)
**   150 ml white wine vinegar
**   150 ml vegetable oil (I use sunflower, I don't recommend olive, I guess nut oil works too)
*

Put the oil in a frying pan and put on a medium heat. Grind up what needs to be ground (or buy pre-ground) and mix all the dry ingredients together. Then add the liquids plus some water if needed to have a thin paste. Pour into oil and let it bubble gently for 10 mins or so. Let it cool before putting in tupperware. Warning - it does stain.

For the Chicken Tikka Masala itself, I usually do 6 chicken breasts for 3.5 people (us, Fiona, Ois/Shibs nibbling). Yeah, we're hungry savages.

*   6 chicken breasts cut into thick strips
**   a thumb of fresh ginger peeled and roughly chopped
**   3 or 4 cloves garlic roughly chopped (or to taste)
**   1 chilli roughly chooped (or 1 tbsp of harissa or jarred chillis)
**   8 tbsp of the paste
**   1 pot natural yoghurt
**   2 medium onions roughly chopped
**   2 tbsp tomato puree
**   4 tbsp ground almonds
**   300-400 ml water
**   150-200 ml cream
**   half a lemon
**   vegetable oil

Mix 3 tbsp of the paste with the yoghurt, cover the chicken all over with it and leave to marinade for as long as you have. To be honest this is rarely more than an hour for me.

Onions, garlic, ginger, chilli and some oil into big pot and sweat em down for 5 or 6 mins

Add the rest of the paste and cook for a minute. Add the puree and cook for a further few mins. Ditto the almonds which are a really surprising addition but you really miss them if they are not there.

Add enough water so it won't stick and cook it gently for about 20 mins.

Grill the chicken for a 5-7 mins on each side (the book also coats them with butter but I don't bother).

Put on your rice.

Zuzz this sauce using a multiquick or food processor or liquidiser and return to the pot. Squeeze the half lemon in and add cream until it is the consistency you want. Put the chicken in the sauce. Bring it back to bubbling and check for seasoning. The book adds fresh coriander but we're not fans so I leave it out.

Naans under the grill for a minute or two each side.

Drain the rice, plate up, crack open a few tinnies and that's Friday all nicely sorted.

Cork Airport Incompetence,"I meant to write this post a few months back and was finally reminded to yesterday when I was in Cork Airport yet again.

The old airport carparks had the most unreliable equipment on the planet, pure third world garbage. I spent more time stuck in queues trying to get out of there due to malfunctioning barriers than any other airport, including Dublin which I have used more.

So you'd think, when spending €180m on a new airport (and hoping we taxpayers will stump up the money for it), that they'd find a supplier of equipment that, ye know, actually works. Silly me, of course they decided to use the same rubbish as before. Does Cork Airport Authority understand that the phrase ""competitive tender"" does not mean ""cheapest"" or ""close personal friend"", it means ""competitive""?

In the past six months:

*   I was locked into the carpark at 1am for 40 minutes. The barrier ate my ticket and the intercom system would not work. Of course if you embed an intercom into a barrier then the intercom will fail along with the barrier. What incompetent morons [a] designed this and [b] purchased it? A Thomas The Tank Engine Walkie Talkie duct-taped to the machine would be a more intelligent engineering approach to system reliability. I ended up running down to the terminal TWICE to ask to be let out and still failed to exit. Only the arrival of the hotel shuttle bus saved me.
*   On another occasion, the ticket machine printed my ticket so badly that it could not be machine-read when I returned to pay. Of course the support desk was not manned and multiple calls had to be made before someone turned up and printed me a new one so I could leave.
*   I have seen queues of people stuck coming out of the short term car-park due to equipment malfunction.
*   One of the ticket machines has been broken for months. In fact, it's been broken for so long that they have erected a permanent ""temporarily  out of service"" sign! Has the airport not got an SLA in their service contract with the equipment provider? Or is that too complex for them?
[](http://www.twango.com/media/conor.public/conor.10038)

[![Permanent Temporary Sign in Cork Airport - Share on Ovi](http://media.twango.com/m1/medium/0143/6a6991b51e874a4dab4b6413c1f371be.jpg ""Permanent Temporary Sign in Cork Airport - Share on Ovi"")](http://www.twango.com/media/conor.public/conor.10038)

A few simple steps:

*   Dump the incompetent supplier
*   Demote or fire the person who re-ordered this rubbish
*   Replace the equipment with something that works. Maybe ring Frankfurt and ask them what they use
*   Look up the acronym SLA
If Al-Qaeda wants an easy way into Ireland then Cork Airport is the route to take. There are obviously no CCTV cameras in operation or else these constant problems would be noticed far sooner by staff. If the Airport Authority is interested, I know a guy who could set them up with a reliable mesh of wireless enabled webcams for a few hundred Euro. Not everything has to cost €180m and reliability can be a default."
Cork CoCo to Support Hot-Desking Setups in County Towns,"I don't know how I missed this [when it was announced recently](http://wcdp.leaderpartnership.ie/uncategorized/2011/07/cork-county-council-to-invest-e1-25m-in-economic-development/). A superb initiative from Cork County Council. They have put aside €300,000 to help with provision of enterprise centres / hot desk facilities in County Towns. This will include a contribution of up to €35,000 for tech and hot desk provision.

The downside is that is doesn't cover building rental but surely some joined-up thinker in the Council is already working on a deal with NAMA to get properties for rental at 10c on the Euro or less? What is the point of having unused empty crumbling buildings when they could be generating rental income and be maintained?

There is nothing even approaching hot-desking in Bandon. As I've written before, the lack of Fibre is a millstone around the neck of the town but at least 12 Mbs ADSL should be available to anyone near the exchange.

Based on my last post there is at least one NAMAfied office building in Bandon. Anyone interested in trying to do something with it? Maybe even some sort of Co-Working space?

Cork Sailing Blog,"We went on our summer holidays to Barley Cove for 11 years in a row as kids. On several of those years we went to Garnish Island via Glengarrif. That was as far as I ever got on the Beara peninsula until last week when I visited Adrigole. I honestly can't put into words how beautiful it is down there. If I was American I'd call it God's country. Perfect views on a perfect day made me want to immediately retire and move there.

[![Adrigole Bay](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2338/2038075642_9f6225a3b3_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2038075642/ ""Adrigole Bay by bandon1, on Flickr"")

I also discovered that there is a blog been written down there by [Gail and the West Cork Sailing team](http://www.westcorksailing.blogspot.com/). Now I've never been into sailing or boats but this could get me interested. Lots of reports from the vessels themselves along with lovely photos. I'm now subscribed.

Craic Pack Invades Dundrum,"Just got a mail from old college buddy Niamh Shaw. She has taken the oft-travelled path of Degree in Engineering, PhD in Engineering, Gaiety School of Acting, Fair City, comedy troupe and is now part of the Craic Pack in Dublin.

They've been doing comedy improv every Wed & Friday in The Bankers Bar, Trinity St in Dublin for a long time and they've just announced that on Saturday, July 28th, they’re going to do an ever bigger and funnier show in the Mill Theatre, in Dundrum Shopping Centre. Watch as the Drummy Mummies scatter in fear :-)

If she is even 10% as funny as she was all those years ago in Earlsfort Terrace then you'll be expelling snot at high velocity during this gig. You can find out lots more at [www.myspace.com/thecraicpack](http://www.myspace.com/thecraicpack)

On a vaguely related topic, we're now up to 16,598 views of [the Steorn Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q_ESdiF2wM#GU5U2spHI_4). Head on over and try to get us to 20,000!"
Creative Camp comes to Kilkenny,"As someone who grew up in Kilkenny from the age of 6-18, I was very excited to see that [Creative Camp](http://creativecamp.barcamp.ie/) is on this weekend. Not only that, but it's on in the wonderful Kilkenny Castle where I spent many a day trying to find secret tunnels as a kid.

If you are wondering what it is all about, the idea is that the attendees are the presenters. It is in the BarCamp tradition of ""unconferences"" where the agenda for the day is very much made up on the day. You might think this is a recipe for disaster but the success of BarCamps in Cork, Waterford, Dublin, Belfast, Galway and PodCamp would suggest otherwise.

PodCamp was held a few months back in Kilkenny and was particularly interesting since it broke out of the ""techie geeky"" community and had many attendees and contributors from the world of media and the arts.

The aim of Creative Camp is to continue on in that vein and really get a broad cross-section of those in technology, arts, media and creativity to meet and exchange ideas and experiences.

If you are in the South East on Saturday, I highly recommend that you attend. It is completely free but it would be polite to register so they have some idea of numbers. The success of each *Camp is dependent on active participation by all who attend.

Some of the topics that have already been suggested for the day include:

*   Outsourcing your development workload to free your creative time
*   Branding an Arts organisation from the inside
*   GPS For Developers
*   Writing and promoting your book with social media
*   How To Blog Like A Boy
*   The Art Of Software Development
*   Creating a vibrant, connected Arts Community in the South East
*   How Friends Communicate
*   GPS Drawing
*   Building and working in a distributed startup
*   Creative Ways To Reduce Your Carbon Footprint
*   Personalisation and the Social Web
*   Women and Technology - grabbing the blogosphere by the balls
Why not wander down and see what it is all about?"
Creativity and Education,"What started off as [a throwaway comment](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/920049669) on Twitter today led me to one of the most inspirational talks I have seen since Hans Rosling at Le Web.

Sir Ken Robinson [talks at TED](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html) about how the current education system kills creativity and continues to take the 19th Century approach of generating people trained for industry.

It's 20 minutes long and I encourage you to watch every minute. It isn't just thought provoking, it is also hilarious.

 Cully and Sully  Chicken and Leek Pie - Thumbs up from 2 to 37,"I got back from the US on Sunday after a tortuous routing - if our feet didn't actually touch the ground in St Louis, can we say we have been there? I was pretty much all beefed out (hope to god that is not some awful double entendre) after a Texan week. Catherine had spotted the Cully & Sully ready-meals in Supervalue and grabbed two to see what they were like. As neither of us had the energy to cook, I decided to give the  Chicken & Leek Pie a twirl.

The pies come in a plastic-sealed ramekin-style ceramic dish which you can obviously re-use and they cost about a fiver. Great value when you consider the dish. Four minutes in the micro and it was ready to go. The result? De-lish, tasty, tasty, tasty: Spuddies, chicken, leek, sauce - what more could you ask for?

I rarely eat ready-meals nowadays but I was a fiend for them in college. Findus crispy pancakes, potato waffles and beans - I will never ever eat that combo again. Birds Eye Beef Curry - ditto. Dunnes Stores Roast Chicken Dinner - agghhhhh. But Cully & Sully are in an entirely different league. When I had that chat with Cully at the Ballymaloe course, he admitted he had never eaten one of those Boil in the Bag dinners in his life. You can tell - the pie I had on Monday was up there with home cooking.

But as I may be influenced by Sully's recent kind words on this blog, I decided to consult with high-flying flamboyant girl about Bandon town, Sibéal O'Neill, for her independent opinion. Not known for her retiring nature in matters of food, Sibéal had been having dinner at the same time as me. She was deeply unhappy with her lovely fish dinner. Unprompted she started dipping her food into the sauce in my pie. When I was finished, she grabbed the dish off me with her two hands, stuck her face in it and licked it clean. No words necessary there really. And none possible beyond ""YUM!"" as she is only 2.

Cully and Sully Scale Everest,"Well not quite but they did get to Nepal. In Sully's own words

> If you would like to see Cully & Sully in action (and have a good laugh) tune into RTE 1 at 22.45 tonight.
> 
> There will be a half hour programme about our recent trip roughing it in Nepal whilst attempting to assist a women’s cooperative – you’ll get a flavour of my truly amazing negotiation skills and Cul’s cooking under pressure!!!!!

If you are not familiar with their soups and ready meals, check them out the next time you don't feel like cooking. We are fans."
"Cully and Sully, the Dragons await","I just got a mail from Colum over at [Cully and Sully](http://www.cullyandsully.com/) to say they are going to be on the TV tonight. If you don't know them they have two main businesses: The first is supplying lovely pies to pubs whose only cooking apparatus is a microwave. The second is supplying same/similar&nbsp;packaged pies to supermarkets. Now we normally never buy pre-made dinners but their ones are&nbsp;really gorgeous and you get to&nbsp;keep a nice ceramic dish when you are finished.

I've just checked and this is a much bigger deal than Sully let on. It is actually a preview of the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year award! This is fantastic and the guys absolutely deserve to be one of the nominees. Here's hoping they come out on top.

It's a three parter starting on RTE1 at 11pm. Fingers crossed that Cully got his hair cut ;-) I believe Brian O'Driscoll has some tips there.

Colum also mentioned their new Rather Portly Beef and Stout Pie. One of our all-time fave winter dinners is Beef and Guinness made with the Sophie Grigson recipe ([variation here](http://www.uktvfood.co.uk/index.cfm?uktv=recipes.recipeandiID=512304)) and mashed spuds. The boys have a challenge on their hands to beat that, so I'll definitely have to give it a go.

Curious Wines launches,"You eagle-eyed West Cork drivers may have noticed a big new sign on the back of one of the units behind Great Gas on the Bandon Bypass. It is the retail/warehouse outlet of newly launched [Curious Wines](http://www.curiouswines.ie/). Mike Kane, the owner, has put together a brilliant selection of wines which are not your usual supermarket generic stuff.

Their [web-site](http://www.curiouswines.ie/) has just gone live and it's a corker (boom! boom!). Another stunning creation by the shockingly talented [Ms Dent](http://www.sabrinadent.com/2008/11/18/curiouswinesie-launched/). I think it's probably the best looking and most effective wine web-site in the country and puts the major chains to shame. The wine value is also fantastic and you really should buy by the case and save even more.

Curses - Tagged,"So [Haydn](http://www.mediangler.com/2006/12/26/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-me/) tagged me. Five things you don't know about me eh? Apart from my Spaghetti Hoop fetish?

  1\.  I was Junior Irish Archery Champion in 1980\. Not as impressive as it sounds. Three of us in the competition and other two were beginners. Never improved after that and gave up in mid-teens. Turns out not everyone else saw a blob of colours down the end of the field and I later found out I was short-sighted. My other problem was that...

  2\.  I appear to be what is known as [cross-dominant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dominance). No not a Tranny Whip Fetishist but I mix use of left and right. I'm not ambidextrous but I write right-handed, am left footed, left eyed and hurl left handed (the twice a year when I hurl). I think I'd be more comfortable golfing left-handed too, if I ever golfed. I switched to using my left hand for the mouse last year and find it more natural than using the right. For fun I've starting writing like a 3 year old with my left hand on occasion too. So in archery, holding a bow right-handedly but using my left eye meant that I couldn't get the ""sight"" out far enough to the left to line it up correctly, so I always had to aim off centre. I cudda been a contenda otherwise.

  3\.  I have the worlds most awesome wife with whom I am still having a fling 16 years later. ""Ah go on, let me stay on your couch"" after a night in Kiely's Bar led to marriage and five loudly opinionated children.

  4\.  I was a thespian for a few short weeks in 1985 in the St Kieran's College school play. I played the allegedly batty mother, Sybil Walling. It was a pretty dire farce built around a body up a chimney. Still [seems to be popular](http://www.bottishamplayers.org.uk/brushpictures.html). Personally I thought I was awesome and basically did a cross-dressing take off of [Margaret Rutherford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Rutherford) playing Miss Marple. And Emmet Cooney still has my copy of the goddammed video of it. I want it back Emmet! This short career diversion was mainly caused by my involvement in Irish and English debating in school (and the No Name Club). I completely dropped debating in college until 4th year when some class-mates decided to properly resurrect Forum, the UCD Engineer's Debating Society. Not as famous as the L&H but ten times funnier and we whipped their asses in any cross-society debate. Ah fond memories of Jabba The Baby Eater and ""Did DoWaDiddy DUM DiddyDoo and did he do so on three separate occasions, twice with a banana?"". Mark Connolly where are you now?

  5\.  I've just had a vasectomy. Ouch. Essay coming soon.

Oops, forgot to tag others. So who can I annoy? Emmm:  [Walter](http://sxoop.wordpress.com/), [Curly K](http://thatfridayfeeling.blogspot.com/) (good excuse to start blogging again woman!), [Anthony](http://ummera.wordpress.com/), [Kieran](http://icecreamireland.com/) and [Neal](http://podchef.motime.com/).

"Dammit, now I'll never have a shoe phone. Maxwell Smart dies.","Now listen carefully. Don Adams, who played [Maxwell Smart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Smart) in one of the best shows of my youth [has died aged 82](http://news.com.com/2061-10786_3-5884139.html?part=rssandtag=5884139andsubj=news). The show actually aired from 1965 to 1970 in the US but I didn't see it until well into the 70's. A very very silly series which I will never forget.

I cannot walk through any building with more than two swing doors in sequence without that tune starting in my head  duh duh duh duuuuuuh, duh duh duh duuuuh...

So we only got a massive SUV instead of a planet-sized one on our arrival in Texas. We're here for the week and I hope I keep my wits about me and take plenty of Nokia Crap-cam pictures. The first one will be of our town runabout with three rows of seats and what sounds like a V6 under the bonnet. I spun the tyres when taking off gently from some traffic lights and squealed them every time I turned a corner.

Nice coincidence too - today is Martin Luther King day and last night we drove past MLK Jr Boulevard. So am I the only one who thought the U2 song was called ""Milk""?

It's gonna be a hard week of work here - not getting back until Sunday but we are less than four miles from Frys for all those critical technology purchases (of course we need  a 50"" Plasma Flatscreen that only plays NTSC DVDs honey. Yes, fitting it in the Samsonite will be a challenge) and I also got me a hankering after some Texas BBQ. All you can eat Brisket, Smoked Turkey and Sausage at The Salt Lick. Mmm, mm, mmm.

Danano's in Derry - Nice Italianish food with incredible value,"Eating out in Derry on a Saturday night without a booking proved to be a bigger challenge than the NI Peace Process. Eoin's unique understanding of local restaurant booking dynamics (all that chemical engineering process training didn't go to waste) meant that most places quoted us up to two hours waiting time at around 8pm.

We put our names down in a few spots and retired to the pub for some pints. Smoking ban down South, yadda yadda, changed my mind, yadda yadda, stinky clothes following morning, yadda yadda, wife mentions stinky hair, yadda yadda, dunno, don't have any, yadda yadda.

About 9.30, we finally got into Danano's which is a 130 seater Italian-style joint. Big menu built around the usual fare of pizza and pasta but with plenty of little surprises to make it interesting. It is BYOB so we grabbed three bottles of wine in the pub (less than £30 in a pub - wow).

We shared three starters between six of us; Seafood selection, nachos and bruschetta. All were excellent and the seafood selection in particular was stunning value - salad, olives. whitebait, prawns on the shell and calamari for less than £4! Tasty too.

Most people went with pizza for mains which looked lovely. I had chicken cacciatore and salad which was nothing awesome but still perfectly good.

In total we had three starters, six mains and corkage for three wines. How much? £59\. Holy crap! Makes you realise how much we are over-paying down south.

Good solid food, tasty, well made, fast service and dirt cheap. Check it out if you are up yonder.

Dave Barry visits Ireland,"And encounters our most precious cultural treasures:

[The Blarney Stone?](http://weblog.herald.com/column/davebarry/archives/016035.html#016035)"
Davida Tapas Bar - Reason enough to stop in Bandon,"A few Saturdays ago, myself and the worlds most understanding wife headed out to the new Tapas Bar in Bandon. I know, I know, you don't often hear the words Tapas and Bandon in the same sentence, but bear with me.

Davida is in a fantastic location on Patrick's Quay in Bandon looking out on the little river (the Bride?) rather than the Bandon itself. There are a few tables out the front for the warmer days and there is a heated area outside at the back too.

The room is dominated by the main bar where all of the food and drink is prepped. The menu is short but everything sounds tasty. The main problem we had was trying to figure out how to tackle the menu. Most people will presumably be just going for light snacks and a few glasses of wine whereas I hadn't eaten since breakfast and was starving.

We asked the very friendly and helpful person in charge (Liz?) for her opinion. She suggested to start with something small, then to try one of the specials. So we went with a small bowl of just-right olives and then had the basque chicken which was excellent. Bit by bit we worked through the menu. The big advantage of the tapas idea is that each person can give up when they are full so Catherine faded before me. The meatballs were superb - as good as my own with the addition of some chilli. And the duck pate was stunningly good.

I have no idea how ""authentic"" the food is in Davida. I should really check out [La Boquiera](http://www.boqueriasixbridgest.com/) in Cork city for comparison. But I'm not remotely bothered if it isn't. The quality of every dish was just right and suited our palates to a tee. What Vivian the owner has created is a really compelling alternative to the pub or big restaurant night out. We spent the night drinking the house red and it was excellent.

One thing that really impressed me was how Vivian has created a menu where all the dishes can be done with a cooler unit, a toaster oven and a microwave. All of the things like meatballs are obviously prepared ahead of time and heated on demand with the other dishes assembled as required. She is right to keep a strictly limited menu with nightly specials and I'm looking forward to seeing what else she comes up with. Anything with chorizo or jamon serrano gets my vote.

The only vaguely negative comment I would make is that a lot of customers are probably going to be clueless like ourselves and maybe an ""introductory paragraph"" in the menu might reduce some anxiety people would have about looking stupid and not knowing how to order.

We were originally worried that maybe it was a step too far for Bandon which to date has not exactly trail-blazed in the area of restaurants. When we arrived at 6.30 on a Saturday evening, we were the first customers. We purposely sat in the window with the aim to encourage others in. By 8.00 some more had joined and by 9.30 it was full. We were thrilled for Vivian and complimented her hugely on her venture. She has identified a genuine pent-up demand for a different way to spend an evening locally. It is also the sort of place that you might pop into at the start and/or end of a night to have a wee tipple and a snack.The lunch menu looks very appealing too and sunday brunch also looks pretty damned fine. I think we'll be making more use of the services of our local baby-sitters over the next few months!If you do mention Davida to anyone, be very clear in how you say Tapas. Several people thought we now had Bandon's first topless bar!

We just loved the whole idea of being able to pace your own meal. It suits everyone from the person in a rush who just wants a quick snack and a coffee to someone who feels like a few glasses of wine out of the house to those looking for a full nights food and drink.

Bandonians - support a great local business and eat, drink or have a coffee there today. Anyone heading to West Cork - do yourselves a big favour, skip the bypass road and stop at Davida to top up on some lovely nibbles before the last leg of your trip.

De Cecco doesn't have to worry,"My sister Orla bought me a pasta machine for Christmas and I finally got around to trying it out on Saturday.

[![Pasta machine](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/170/373863862_e8da33746e_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/373863862/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Myself and Sibéal decided to make a mix of tagliatelle and spaghetti. Neither of us had made it before and her excuse is that she is only 3.

I had the usual recipe problem of not knowing which one to use. Jamie Oliver's Italy book said 6 eggs and 600g of flour and that's it. Another no-name one also added oil and water and salt. I went with Jamie but the dough was far too dry, so I added a bit of oil and that seemed to do the trick.

I clamped the machine to the worktop and ran into the first big problem, I don't have three hands. Oh for that extra 1970's ad washing-up hand to appear. You have to feed the dough in, feed it out on the other side and crank the handle. The first run through was not impressive:

[![First run](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/373864273_42bd8d7991_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/373864273/ ""Photo Sharing"")

This was mainly because i was attempting to fix a 2 inch think lump of dough through a millimetre wide gap.

Two more attempts went a lot better and we ended up with something which looked vaguely like a long sheet of lasagne. I then ran it through the wider cutters and got my tagliatelle.

[![Finished Pasta](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/125/373865003_a91a15e0ba_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/373865003/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Sibéal took over for the narrower cutters and ended up with far better looking spaghetti.

[![Finished Pasta](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/167/373864763_39608673b1_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/373864763/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Fatal flaw was then discovered - we hadn't floured the dough so all the strands stuck together again. I valiantly tugged them apart for twenty minutes, dumped the lot in boiling water and ended up with something that looked and vaguely tasted like pasta. None of the kids would touch it and they were right as the tagliatelle was undercooked and the spaghetti overcooked. Bin.

[![Cooked Pasta](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/373862895_6faa5a7583_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/373862895/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I'm unfazed and will go at spaghetti again. Or maybe lasagne if I lose my nerve. Any top tips for the next time? Except maybe looking at PodChef Neal's [pasta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQ2EqU9bXQ) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7vF4pw1srU) **before** we start? Should we rest the dough even when using a machine? Was the cheap book right when it said you only need minimal kneading if you are using the machine since it does it for you?

I deserve a slap for not doing this review until now. We ate in Deasy's in Ring for Catherine's birthday back in May with my parents. I had heard nothing but great things about it and they did not disappoint. Unfortunately I have the memory of a gnat so the details of the meal have all become a bit hazy (the wine didn't help either). I finally remembered to do the review when I saw fab recipes from the chef, Kaitlin Ruth, in The Examiner yesterday.

Deasy's is situated on a coastal road along Clonakilty Bay as you head towards Kinsale. It is right on a bend and the water is just on the other side of the road. Parking more than 4 cars is a challenge but it is not a busy road. The view is worth millions and this awful picture in no way does it justice:

[![View from Deasy](http://static.flickr.com/45/169475910_8b17c1767e.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/169475910/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Ring is heading towards being in the middle of nowhere and yet Deasy's is always booked out for the weekend. As ever, it proves that no restaurant can use location as an excuse for lack of custom. Deliver great product anywhere and people will flock to you.

The pub and restaurant are all the one and the old wood and old feel to the place is lovely. We were first to arrive for the evening and got the best seats in the house looking out over the bay to the Atlantic.

Most of the menu is seafood but there are veggie and steak options too. One of the recommendations I got for the place mentioned the great steak! All of it sound simple and sounded yum.

This review won't do Deasy's justice as I can't give you the details of all the food we had. I was enjoying it so much I forgot to take pictures! Suffice to say that it was brilliant. Everyone loved what they ordered. All of the fish was cooked to perfection and the sauces really helped the food rather than overwhelming it like most average seafood places tend to do. You can tell that the chef just trusts her great ingredients and lets them speak for themselves.

The only even barely negative thing I can say about the place is that at times the service was patchy but it was always friendly.

We will be going back here - a lot! They do a Sunday lunch (it is the only day that they do) and I have heard that is great too. As far as I know you can't book it. We'll be giving that a go very soon and I'll do a much better review then. 

If you are anywhere in the area and want stunningly good seafood in one of the best locations in the country, take a taxi out to Ring and have a wonderful night. You can call them on 023-35741.

Deep thinking on Energy Demand vs Supply,"I've been talking quite a bit recently to Phoebe Bright who is based down in Drinagh. She wears many hats but is incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about energy.

She writes some absolutely brilliant stuff in this area [on her blog](http://pbjots.blogspot.com/2008/07/energy-demand-just-because-we-want-it.html) and I highly recommend you subscribe to it. She is no happy clappy, let's wear hemp shirts and cycle 40 miles to work every day person. The blog talks about fundamental issues around energy supply and managing energy demand. It's about how it directly affects you.

We were talking about this general topic on the way back from [OpenCoffee BBQ](http://www.opencoffeeclub-bbq.com/) recently and I expressed the opinion that the Green Party are letting themselves down very badly. They should be providing a grand vision backed by simple steps and milestones to help us get our energy usage under control. This requires thought leadership, practical assistance, changes in building regulations, direction to energy providers and a simple message that you will spend less, not more, if you apply some smarts to how you consume energy over the course of a day/week/year. Idiotic prattle about election posters really doesn't cut it.

"Diary of A Virgin Semi-Veggie, Part 1","A few weeks ago I had coffee with Haydn in Urru, Bandon and we spent a good while talking about food and health. He mentioned a book called The China Study which made a very strong scientific case for a plant based diet as a way of dealing with many ailments including heart disease.

As I have been officially obese for the past few years, I was in my regular new year weight loss mode and wanted to do it in a healthy way. The book sounded like an intriguing approach so I bought it on Kindle.

Unlike the relentless quackery that surrounds diet and diets, this was written by a man who worked his entire career as a doctor and researcher. His credits include the NIH and the Cleveland Clinic. I have to say, he makes a very strong case. If you can't face the very very long book, grab a copy of the Forks Over Knives documentary which summarises his and other doctors' thinking. 

The core argument is that the gigantic increase in meat and dairy consumption is to blame for many of our ailments and these problems can be stopped and even reversed by switching to a much more veg-based diet. Basically like we used to eat in every society before we became rich.

So for kicks and giggles I have decided to try a mainly plant-based diet for the next ""while"" (duration TBD). I haven't given up meat and dairy completely but I have cut down hugely.

In the past two weeks I have had no red meat, no eggs, cheese once, some weekend rashers/sausages and a smattering of turkey/chicken. The only dairy I get is a splash of milk in my tea. I tried both rice milk and soy milk and they are gross. A soy latte is an abomination.

On the veggie side, I have had lots of veg (duh), lots of fruit, seeds, wholemeal breads, porridge, hummus, salad and pickled veg. On the pure veggie side I have had Dee's Spicy Bean Burger (not bad), Linda McCartney's veggie sausages (surprisingly spot-on both for texture and taste), Brendan's Vegetarian Burritos (nice taste but pure slop) and fried tofu with a ras el hangout coating (texture is too squishy).

Things I cannot stand about most veggie food in cafes etc are the ubiquitous bell peppers, aubergines and courgettes. Everything tastes the bloody same.

Tomorrow I'll do a middle-eastern type thingy with falafel which I have become addicted to.

On the recommendation of several veggies I got the Veganomicon cookbook which I have just started and is a good fun read.

Plan for next week is more beans, more texture and less chicken/turkey. The only thing I'm not giving up is the Friday chicken curry. I did a butternut squash curry last week and I'm sorry, but no.

Texture remains an issue with all the non-meat proteins. I'm going to take trip into Quay Co-Op on Saturday to see what else they have. Seitan maybe? I'll also see what else Tobairin in Bandon has (they do the burritos and the tofu).

Funnily enough I'm doing more a vegan thing than a vegetarian thing. Who would have thunk? Let's see how long I last.

Another update in a few weeks."
"Diary of A Virgin Semi-Veggie, Part 2","So we're what, maybe 4 weeks into the experiment? Overall it's going great apart from the giant hole in the ozone layer that my methane is creating ;-)

I'm still picking at the odd bit of ham/turkey and I'm still doing the Friday Chicken Curry but apart from that, it is all veggie. If I removed the milk from my tea I'd basically be vegan. But that ain't happening.

Foods I continue to love on this diet:

*   Hummus
*   Falafel
*   Asparagus
*   Broccoli
*   Avocado
*   Portobello mushrooms
*   Beetroot
*   Tomatoes
*   Salad leaves
*   Pomegranate seeds
*   Porridge with linseed and goji berries/prunes
*   Ryvita
*   Brown Rice (surprisingly)
*   Dee's Burgers
*   Linda's Sausages
*   Home made pizza (one reason for needing fake cheese)
*   A wide range of relishes, chutneys and pickles
*   Lemon, Balsamic and Soy sauce for sparkle
Things I found a bit meh:

1.  German Tofu with Kombucha
2.  Quorn sausages
3.  Quorn chicken pieces
<div>Things I miss:</div>
<div>

1.  Fridge Buffet with sliced meats (Fridge Buffet is the greatest phrase ever, coined by my old friend Oisín who runs [The Ship Wandsworth](http://www.theship.co.uk/) gastropub)
2.  Toasted ham and cheese (another reason for needing fake cheese)
</div>
Today I did a run to the famous Quay Co-Op in Cork to get some other things I wanted to try plus some staples. I'll do an update after I try the new things but purchases included:

1.  Sheese fake cheddar
2.  Cheezly fake mozzarella
3.  Quinoa
4.  Chia Seeds (I literally just read about these in Born To Run last night. Some miracle seeds apparently. Or so the Beanstalk boy said.)
5.  Tempeh
6.  Udon Noodles
7.  Miso Soup
8.  Oatly oat-based milk substitute
9.  Stevia sweetener
10.  Sauerkraut
11.  Prunes
12.  Puy Lentils
13.  Smoked Tofu
14.  Apple puree
15.  Ramen
16.  More porridge flakes, brown rice etc
17.  Agave sweetener
I have a blogpost forming in my head about how the veggie-world needs a giant processed food corporation (Kraft, Nestle, etc) to throw all the knowledge of their food scientists at making better substitute products. I'm convinced something far superior to all this extruded mushy stuff can be created. The fatal flaw in most of the products I have tried remains texture. The sponginess of the tofu, even fried, was particularly horrible. Looking forward to seeing if Tempeh is better.

Also, given how far removed a chicken nugget is from actual chicken, I am 100% sure McDonalds could do a Vegan McNugget that was indistinguishable in taste and texture to a ""chicken"" one.

So onwards we go. I need to expand the range of things so I don't get bored. Time to dig into the [Veganomicon](http://www.amazon.com/Veganomicon-Ultimate-Vegan-Cookbook-ebook/dp/B003ZUY148/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8andm=AG56TWVU5XWC2) more.

UPDATE 1: Just made a Sheese toastie. Not the worst thing I've ever tasted. The Sheese out of the packet smells rank and tastes like standard processed cheese. It doesn't melt brilliantly but when paired with a decent mustard, I scoffed the lot. Needed a slice of ham or something tho!

UPDATE 2: Tried the Agave sweetener in my tea. Perfectly tasty but then it is mainly just fructose. It says low GI but really, I have to wonder. The Stevia thing is interesting tho. From the makers of Canderel. Very new product. No calories but lots of lactose. If it lacks the after-taste of Saccharin, Aspartame and Sucralose, I'll be happy.

UPDATE 3: The Cheezly smells as rank as the Sheese but melts ok and tastes fine when melted. The third type of veggie sausage was nasty and dry. The ramen were lovely. And the real winner was the Tempeh. Nutty, solid, fries well, great texture. Gonna use a few different ways this week.

"Diary of A Virgin Semi-Veggie, Part 3","It all kicked off in mid-Jan and here we are on April 1st, still at it. I don't have a huge number of updates since [the last one in February](http://conoroneill.com/2012/02/18/diary-of-a-virgin-semi-veggie-part-2/) but a couple of interesting tidbits, including one which just happened and threw me completely.

Overall, it's still entirely vegetarian except for the Friday chicken curry and I'm be strongly tempted to replace that with something veggie soon due to a [great Indian Veggie book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Classic-Indian-Vegetarian-Cookery-Julie/dp/1904010571) my sister got me. Apart from milk in my tea and porridge and the odd bit of cheese on a homemade pizza, I'm still also pretty close to vegan. Those fake cheese really did turn out to be disgusting and were binned. Oh I nearly forgot, I also still love mayo which has eggs. Those vegan alternatives were like cheap own-brand salad cream. Texture people, texture!

One big problem is that I've been totally unable to find an acceptable milk substitute. Soy Milk is the work of the devil and Rice Milk is the work of his assistant. Try either in tea and you will pour them down the sink immediately. A Chai Tea Latte in Heuston Station was one of the most disgusting things I've ever put in my mouth and I've eaten pigs brains.

But a few weeks ago I bought something called [Oatly](http://www.oatly.co.uk/) and I just tried it in a cuppa and wow wow wow, it works! No nasty aftertaste, no horrible texture, just a nice creamy addition to my tea with a not off-putting different shade to the usual milk one. I'm thrilled and will buy lots more the next time I'm in [Quay Co-Op](http://www.quaycoop.com/Home.html).

The Oatly stuff is really interesting on several levels. It's made from oats, water and oil using a process from the University of Lund in Sweden. I love the idea of using products that are grown locally in a country to try and find new uses for them. As we all know, oats are very good for you too. So this is a win, win, win for me I think. Tomorrow I will try on my porridge which is amusing I guess, since they are both made from the same thing.

Week to week I am sticking with the tempeh, smoked tofu, lots of veg, lots of fruit, hummus, falafel, ramen, curries, miso soup and a jam-packed morning porridge with goji berries, chia seeds and honey. Those Chia seeds are mad and I'm a fan. If you've read Born to Run, you'll already know all about them. A guy in Waterford is selling them branded [Chia Bia](http://www.chiabia.com/) which is a nice touch so I've bought those.

I continue to buy [Dee's Burgers](http://www.meatfreemondays.ie/dees_products.html) but we have failed to spot her new ready meals in the usual West Cork haunts and I really want to try them. Maybe in Scally's today?

The main thing lacking right now is variety and that's down to time. I need to dig deeper into the Veganomicon for fast recipes. I had a real win last week after watching an episode of [River Cottage Veg Every Day](http://www.rivercottage.net/) where Hugh FW and the guys had a veggie sambo competition. I would never have thought of putting orange or carrot in a sandwich but they were gorgeous. However both myself and my bro-in-law Phil would lay claim to having invented the beetroot sandwich many years ago, so hands off!

What else? Oh yeah, I tried some of the Quorn fake sliced meats (turkey and ham). Nah sorry, completely the wrong texture and too dry. I've been banging on about the texture problem since the start so I was thrilled to see this NY Times video posted on Facebook by my old collegemate Bernard who has been a vegan for decades and is currently trying out the raw food approach. If this product hits the shelves I'll be a very happy bunny:

<iframe id=""nyt_video_player"" title=""New York Times Video - Embed Player"" src=""http://graphics8.nytimes.com/bcvideo/1.0/iframe/embed.html?videoId=100000001415887andplayerType=embed"" frameborder=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""480"" height=""373""></iframe>

More updates when I've tried a few curries and sandwiches."
"Diary of A Virgin Semi-Veggie, Part 4","Hard to believe I started this in mid-Jan and we are just about to bounce into May.

Plenty of activity in the past month, some good, some bad. Variety and texture remain problematic but overall, sticking to veggie and fairly vegan for the past few weeks.

Some product updates to share. First, the good ones:

*   Sojade - A bifidus soya yoghurt-alternative. This is a shocker. Smells and pretty much tastes like natural yoghurt. Has that lactic tang which is so missing in most soy products. Used it in a curry instead of yoghurt and could not tell the difference. Pretty sure you could add pureed fruit to it to make normal yoghurts and not be able to tell it lacks dairy. Got it and several other recent products in Quay Co-Op in Ballincollig. It's not as big as the Cork one but handier for me to get to.
*   Silken Tofu - Found this shelf-stable stuff in Scally's in Clon. Total disaster when I tried to fry it and use in curry. It just melted. However it makes a brilliant dairy alternative for many recipes where smoothness and creaminess required. I used it in a pea puree recipe instead of cream and it worked a treat in the food processor. I'll post that recipe soon, it was a big success.
*   Quorn Mince - Yesterday I made traditional spag bol for the kids but used Quorn instead of minced beef. All of the kids loved it and rated it delicious. I told none of them what they were actually eating. Proves, yet again, my point about a lot of foods being easily replaceable with plants, if you can get the texture right.
*   Dal - After reading most of an Indian Vegetarian cookbook, I finally did one of the recipes yesterday (minus the relentless Usli Ghee on every page). This was a spicy dal with 6 chillis and red lentils. Utterly gorgeous. Had more of it today and will have more again tomorrow. Total win, full of protein.
*   Darina Allen's Cucumber Pickle Recipe - if you loved the jars and miss them, her recipe is identical and only takes a few mins with a mandolin to do. Apparently they cancelled the supermarket product as the stuff was fermenting and blowing the lids. You can still get it fresh in Midleton Farmer's Market. I'll post the recipe here soon with full attribution.
Now for the failures:

*   Quorn Smoky Bacon Slices - Horrible. Imagine a plate of BBQ-flavoured Rancheros with the rest of your food. Nothing is right about this product from taste to smell to texture
*   Quorn Chicken Pieces - I've gone completely off this. Texture is just so wrong.
*   Some veggie sausages with leeks - You can't just mush spuds and leeks together into a tube and call it a sausage. It's a bloody croquette. Nothing wrong with the taste, it's just false advertising.
Apart from that, still doing some Oatly but finding it too much in every cup of tea. Tea is really my downfall for the vegan bit. Still doing low-fat milk there and in the morning porridge. A bit of goat's cheese in the two-weekly homemade pizza too. That's about it for dairy.

More stuff on recipes in the coming weeks. But in the meantime, seek out that Sojade, you won't believe how good it is!

Kind Auntie Fiona took care of our angels on Friday night so Catherine and I could trot down to Timoleague for a bite to eat. Dillon's gets [a strange mini-review in the 2004 edition of Georgina Campbell](http://www.ireland-guide.com/establishment/dillons.3328.html). It isn't really clear whether they think much of it. Dillon's describe themselves as a cafe bar which can mean a wide range of things.

We popped our head in the door to see a normal bar with beer taps but no-one sitting at it and then a bunch of tables with people eating. It was pretty much full at 8pm which is a good sign. Decor is sort of shabby chic with a mix of table and chair types. I loved the look of the bar itself. Nice friendly welcome and we kicked off with two G&T's.

I started off with duck spring rolls and Catherine had crab cakes. We also ordered a bottle of red Bordeaux at €23 which was excellent and extremely good value. My spring rolls were lovely and came with an unknown but very tasty dipping sauce. Catherine thought her crab cakes were only fine. But both plates were ruined by having a pile of diced generic salad which clearly came from a vac-packed bag and some big lumps of unripe tomato. Nasty and unnecessary. I'd have preferred either nothing or maybe some undressed coleslaw or something seasonal.

The mains were far far better. I had two wee quail which were fab and came with a good sauce. Catherine had the duck which seemed to be a popular choice at other tables too and she thought it was great. Both came with generic microwaved/steamed veg side plate. I'm thinking of starting a campaign to have this banned in restaurants instead of smoking. Nothing wrong with it, nothing right, why bother? Why not add some flavour and make it part of the meal?

Desserts were both superb. I had blueberry creme brulee which was awesome and Catherine had a plate-lickingtastic ice-cream thingy with cherries, nuts and chocolate sauce. Coffees were good too.

Then came the bill: €113! Bloody hell. That is so out of whack with the level of the food, it just is not funny. At maybe €85 I would have left happy but €113 is a similar price to a meal we had in Les Gourmandises which is one of the best restaurants in Munster.

But the place was full of locals and had sounded full the previous night when Catherine had booked, so what do they care what I think. If people are willing to pay way over the odds for mid-range food then let them. But at those prices, I don't think we'll be rushing back.

Diner won't be dining at the Diner again,"Ach, I hate giving bad reviews of places. I genuinely want every place I eat in to dazzle me. A few months back a new place opened in Bandon - ""Jack O'Dwyer's Diner"". It caught my eye instantly because I had only just been blogging about [the dearth of fab and interesting burger joints in Ireland](http://conoroneill.com/2005/06/25/burger-innovation-in-ireland/). Of course I was concerned that it would just be another crappy chipper with a bit of an image makeover but deep down I was really hoping that someone had had the vision to make a great diner in Bandon that would put the likes of the Eddie Rockets of the world in the shade. It shouldn't be too hard - Eddie Rockets itself is a straight lift of [Johnny Rockets](http://www.johnnyrockets.com/index2.php) in the US. The ideal would be good fast food with a ton of variations on a small set of staples in a traditional US diner environment.

We had just been to Long Strand to let the kids dig some holes and let Oisín run into the water and get soaked (Oisín is a 4-year old child as opposed to a dog but the behaviour on a beach is pretty similar). On the way back we decided to finally give Jack O'Dwyers a try.

Initial impressions were excellent - Neon Pepsicola sign in the window and a genuinely excellent look to the whole place with classic booths and bar stools and bits of Americana on the wall. The waitress was helpful but not exactly ""have a nice day y'all"". She passed around the tiny menus and pointed out the specials on the blackboard. At this point it all fell apart. We appeared to have been 15 minutes early for the full menu and so got this bizarre stripped down mixture of hotel carvery food,sandwich&nbsp; melts and one burger (which I nearly missed). The specials included beef curry and chicken n ham. Beef what? With chips?After the meal I found a full menu on the counter and it was more as I had hoped/expected - Nachos, burgers, steaks etc. But what an odd way to advertise the place during the day. And why the change? The whole point of a classic diner is the same food all day up to 24 hrs a day. This is where the idea of the all-day breakfast came from. Instead we get this potential out-take from Michael Douglas in Falling Down.

Utterly despondant, I ordered the burger (no options offered), Catherine had the chicken melt and the three squirts had plaice and chips. We inquired about milk-shakes. No. No? In a diner? No? Ribena ok instead? Yeah I guess. Milk for Ois (still sounds like a terrier doens't he) and coffees for us. Food arrived out in double quick time which was great as our darlings are not part of the Franco-Italian culture of behaving in a restaurant. My burger bun was a lovely looking floury bap which is infinitely preferable to those pseudo-McDonalds buns you get in most places. But apart from that, I got a mass-produced beef patty from the freezer, a slice of tomato, some iceberg and a dollop of mayo, chips from a wholesaler, coleslaw from a tub and potato salad from a tub. Catherines exactly the same, replacing the words beef patty, with the words piece of battered chicken. Kids got breaded plaice from the freezer and chips. They ate the chips. And for this fine piece of freezer-to-deep-fat-fryer chefery? €47!

Now you may think I'm being ridiculously picky and if it had cost €20 for the lot then maybe I would be. But this is local chipper level food at totally inappropriate prices. The sad thing is that for half the money we could have had a better meal in McDonalds (which we did in Roscrea on Saturday). I just do not get why someone goes into business to create food which can't even compete with McDonalds. I don't want to sound like I'm getting a nasty dig at these people. Running a restaurant is, by all accounts, one of the toughest things one can do. The hours are brutal and the chances of success are often slim. They have far more bottle than me in setting up something like this. These are, I believe, local people and they have clearly pumped a ton of money into setting this place up. It looks great and it seems like they have a full-featured kitchen but I really really don't think they will succeed as is by having no differentiator other than the the word ""diner"" and I would so love for them to do well. Entrepreneurship should always be lauded. 

But if I want carvery food, I'll go to the Musters Arms or a multitude of pubs. If I want Birds Eye or Carroll Meats food from a deep-freeze, I'll go to the chipper (and actually the main chipper is pretty good). So who is this diner targeted at? A farmer in for a slap-up beef dinner wouldn't even think of going into a place like that. Young uns will go in but only once after they see the bill. Tourists will surely be attracted by the look of the place but there are only so many of them.

I just do not get it. It's like the vision just went completely astray at some point. Or is it that a bank manager or accountant is in the driving seat and utterly focused on cost base and forgetting that they need actual paying punters for the place to be a success?&nbsp; I would love to see the place do well but I cannot see it happening with the current approach. Why can't the aim to be the best damned burger and shake joint in the country? Why shouldn't this be the first in a chain? There are so many places which could be used as a benchmark. Look at Elephant and Castle in Dublin - the food is absolutely nothing to write home about with dreadful service and but it is solid good quality fare. And they have legendary chilli-sauce coated chicken gristle (Buffalo Wings for those who missed the sarcasm) and as a result the place is usually hopping. There is no reason why Jack O'Dwyers could not emulate that.

I am convinced that a really good ""proper"" diner would be a roaring success. Even simple touches could help to start with - the ""house secret recipe"" for the burger sauce (you can get the Big Mac recipe on the web at a push). Nachos topped with everything (and I mean everything) offered as a good group starter as soon as people are seated. Most people may not have been thinking of a starter but they'll probably think - hmm that might be nice, sure, a big bowl of Nachos please. Eggs done 16 different ways. Simple simple things to start heading towards what could become a destination eartery for anyone heading towards West Cork and in the mood for good tasty fast food. Fingers crossed.

Dinosaur or Giraffe?,"Serious argument in our house this dinner-time. Fionn's toy, is it a Dinosaur or a Giraffe? Let the people decide:

Discovering Black Sabbath at the age of 37,"One of the business blogs I read is Fred Wilson over at ""[A VC](http://avc.blogs.com/)"". He regularly recommends music worth listening to. The other day [he mentioned Black Sabbath Vol 4](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2006/03/nuggets_1.html). Apart from watching Ozzy on the TV and thinking that ""Paranoid"" is one of the top twenty best songs of all time, I have never listened to any Black Sabbath.

I headed on over to my fave music site at the minute ""[AllofMp3.com](http://conoroneill.com/www.allofmp3.com)"" to see what they had. This is a very controversial site based in Russia which provides MP3 versions of almost any album possible for rock bottom prices. People like the RIAA in the US claim that they cannot be doing this legally and can't be giving the correct level of royalties to the performers. I dunno. The only worry I had was handing my credit card details over to a site in Russia. I wondered if I would soon be getting charges on my card for beluga caviar. But it appears to be all above board and I've had no problems. Most of the albums come in at about $1.30 (Kill Bill Vol 1 Soundtrack, Garden State soundtrack) but for some reason ""The Best of Black Sabbath"" was $4.50.

I'm listening to it now. Oh it's good. Don't like ""Black Sabbath"" the song - too like Led Zeppelin at their most bloated, But ""The Wizard"" is a fabulous song.

Growing up, I really wasn't in to music. My first ever record was bought for me by my Auntie Lena in (I think) Dolphin Discs. It was ""Jailhouse Rock"" re-released when The King died. Still a great song! But I remember being in sixth class in primary school and kids talking about Sid Vicious and how cool he was. I had no idea what they were talking about. I think Sid Coyne and Sid Byrne both re-named themselves after the aforementioned Pistol.

Then first year in Secondary School was very confusing. Why would people be engraving electricity symbols on their desks with their biros? Why did people like a German band which I pronounced ""Muterhod"". And why did Neil Young in third year have a sleeveless denis jacket with his name in studs on the back? And Brendan wondered why Neil never replied to ""hey Neil""!

I spent most of my teens listening to synth pop like Depeche Mode (before they were cool), Howard Jones (who was never cool) and Duran Duran (who I still like, go on flame me). But this deeply offended the music sensibilities of my friend Dermot who started giving me tapes of Led Zeppelin, Leonard Cohen, Stefan Grapelli, Pink Floyd and The Doors. It kinda worked, I became a Doors fanatic and a Cohen fan (still am in both cases).

Of course every girl I ever dated (or married!) thought the Doors were ok but all the rest of em were rubbish. I was force fed a diet of The Smiths, U2 and cool Depeche Mode with the odd foray over to The Pixies, NIN and Smashing Pumpkins. Ok, it worked, I now think ""Debaser"", ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" and ""Personal Jesus"" are fab songs.

Back in a sec, ""Paranoid"" has just started...........Back again. Not top twenty, top ten.

I did an exchange trip to Germany when I was 14 where the guy I was exchanging with was a heavy metal fanatic. I spent night after night listening to his AC/DC and (far more importantly to him) Scorpions. I was like an old man: ""it all sounds like noise to me, where's the melody?"". And that was it for nearly twenty years.

It is probably a bit sad that I only started buying heavy metal in my 30's and even then it was usually ""Best Of's"" like AC/DC, Motorhead etc. But I'm with [Twenty Major](http://twentymajor.blogspot.com/2006/01/new-year-wishes.html) - at least I'm not buying c****ing Damien Rice.

I think Fred's recommended ""Vol 4"" may be my next purchase.

Doing something about bullying - Tuairisc,"Brian Greene contacted me last week about a new project he has just launched called [Tuairisc.me](https://tuairisc.me/). Like many good ideas, it's brilliantly simple. It's an anti-bullying form for school web-sites that can be added with a single line of HTML to any site.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tuairsc-logo-wide.png ""tuairsc-logo-wide"")](https://tuairisc.me/)

I sent some questions/thoughts over to Brian and his responses convinced me that this thing has legs. But it will only work if as many people as possible know about it.

So if you are a parent, a teacher or even a student, let's make this happen for your school. Get them to go to [Tuairisc.me](https://tuairisc.me/), sign the school up for the FREE service and grab that one line of code.

If the school gets stuck adding the code, I'm sure many people, including me, would be glad to figure it out for you.

Then get the message out. If your school uses SMS, send one. If it uses school-bag paper-slips, use that. Put posters in the school telling kids they can safely and securely report bullying via the school's site.

[Tuairisc](https://tuairisc.me/) is another perfect example of a motivated tech person getting us from ""someone should do something about this"" to actually doing something about it. I hope we see many more."
Don't mess with the Irish,"I was enraged on Thursday whilst listening to the latest [Restaurant Guys' podcast](http://www.restaurantguysradio.com/sle/rg/content/shows/index.asp?show_id=478). They were interviewing a New York restaurateur who is being picketed by fois gras protestors. These ugg-boot-wearing idiots think they can intimidate a small business owner and effectively put him out of business. These cowards don't have the balls to go after large fast-food chains who sell industrially produced chicken and figure they'll go for easy marks instead.

Unfortunately for these hypocrites, this restaurant owner is Irish and (like the rest of us) he doesn't like people telling him what to do. I was then thrilled to discover who he was. The restaurant is [Knife + Fork](http://www.knife-fork-nyc.com/) and he is Damien Brasel. He was made head chef in Peacock Alley in Dublin at the age of 20! Two of my top ten meals of all time were in Peacock Alley in its heyday before it all went pear-shaped.

His response to these lazy cause-of-the-week nitwits? Put a fois gras tasting menu on! The outcome? His business has improved. Result :-)

If you are in New York and wondering where to eat, can I recommend you try [Knife + Fork](http://bit.ly/VJPCY)? Bring some chicken nuggets with you to throw at the wastes-of-oxygen picketing outside at the weekend."
Double Entries are coming,"No, this isn't a post about accounting. I'm trying to do my tiny little bit to help the [Structured Blogging](http://www.structuredblogging.org/) effort. 

To this end I'll be creating a set of pseudo-duplicate posts over the next few days. Each pair will consist of an unstructured ""normal"" post and a matching structured one. 

Hopefully I'll be then able to feed the structured ones into some aggregators like [kritX ](http://kritx.com/)and this will provide us with a set of screenshots showing how you can go from randomly organised posts (e.g. most of my current reviews), to structured ones with a format which suits the topic (e.g. information on podcasts) to having those structured posts collected automatically by other systems and used in some value-add way.

Those other systems will enable new services like [consumer review](http://www.revoo.com/) sites, [competitors](http://www.edgeio.com) to [ebay](http://www.ebay.ie), [podcast collections](http://www.podcastalley.com/), [event announcements](http://upcoming.org/) etc. There are, of course, many systems like these already out there. The big change with Structured Blogging is that you just put all the information on your blog in a structured way, you don't have to enter data on any centralized site. 

The addition of the structure to your posts means that the information can be gathered in an intelligent way by those systems without them having to ""interpret"" your meaning from your randomly organized&nbsp; text. 

It'll all make a hell of a lot more sense when I have completed the screen-grabs!

Drivers in West Cork - This is how a roundabout works:,"I hope the National Safety Council don't mind me infringing their copyright but if publishing these pictures can save just one life then it'll be worth it. Those lives will be saved by me not killing with my bare hands the next moron who can't correctly negotiate the ""new"" mini-roundabout in Bandon.

[![roundabout01b](http://static.flickr.com/49/112568014_84cda338f7.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/112568014/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Just because you've driven through that junction the same way for the past 60 years like Col. Michael Collins did before you and Gen. Tom Barry did before him, does not mean you can sail through the roundabout in your 4x4 at 60 MPH without pausing anymore.

Equally, just because the idiots in Cork County Council gave no warning of the change (or the previous junction change), it does not mean you have to have a nervous breakdown everytime you approach the new mini-roundabout and give way to everything including all cats and herons.

I admit the roundabout is a bit of a joke. Many people sail through it because they don't notice it. They should have gone with the Birr approach and used cats eyes to mark it out. The thudda thudda should catch the notice of all but the most asleep.

But then these are the same road design experts who did the road markings for the Bandon Road R'Bout and Sarsfield Rd R'Bout. In other words, these are people who have clearly never driven a motor car. They also can have never watched anyone attempt to negotiate these roundabouts which involve three lane changes to turn right. And these are the same people who put the ""conduire a droite"" sign on the airport road.

Next week - my top tips for you staying on your side of the goddammed road.

DS - not such a toy after all,"I think I like Oscar's Nintendo DS more than he does. He got Karts for christmas and I was blown away by how easy it was to set up with my wireless router so that I could play against other people on the web. Obviously I always come last.

But one of the hinges on the DS broke recently. Looks like a design flaw to me (considering the new DS Lite has a much meatier hinge). Glue would not work. I spent hours searching for replacement parts. Finally, I found a guy on eBay in Pennsylvania [who sold replacement cases](http://cgi.ebay.ie/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=8253509740&sspagename=ADME%3AL%3ARTQ%3A%3A1&rd=1) and would ship to Ireland. $24 plus shipping and a week or so later, I had the case. Then I discovered I needed a special screwdriver to open it. This time Lik-Sang came to the rescue and for a few Euro I got the screwdriver in the post less than a week later.

Last night we took apart the old one, moved all the bits over to the new case and were shocked to find that it worked! Fiddley as f**k but a damn sight cheaper than buying a new one.

But it got me thinking about the DS. It has two ARM CPUs and the main one has about the same welly as a Palm Tungsten T. It has two screens, one of which is touch senstitive and it has Wi-Fi. Would it not strike Nintendo to offer a web-browser as a plug-in cartridge? Or an MP3 player or a multitude of things other than games which would make use of all its features? I know it is outside of their comfort zone and they don't want to make the mistakes that Nokia made with the N-Gage. But still, it is a PDA in all but software. I fell asleep with that thought in my mind.
Anyway, I start checking blogs this morning and what do I find? [Opera are releasing a browser for the DS](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008813.html)!! Fan-bloody-tastic. Obviously, I 'll be keeping that cartridge for myself and not letting Oscar anywhere near it. I can't wait to browse the web at a wireless hot-spot in an airport using a kids toy.
And Nintendo are going [to release a digital TV receiver for it too](http://us.gizmodo.com/gadgets/portable-media/more-nintendo-ds-developments-tv-and-browser-154888.php). Not so awesome for us as we are now about 8 years behind on getting digital terrestrial tv in Ireland but would be tres cool for Freeview viewers in the UK.

PSP my bum.

Dungarvan Follow-up,"I was home sick all day today - vicious flu. Slept most of the day so now it's midnight and I'm wide awake. But my day was brightened by a letter we got in the post from the secretary of a small Kilkenny GAA club. When we had stayed in Clonea Strand Hotel, there had been a lot of shouting and banging in the middle of the night for about 20 minutes. Woke us up but we weren't that bothered. This letter offered profuse apologies for any distress that had been caused. It had been the first time ever the club had stayed overnight anywhere and their good spirits got the better of them. I laughed my ass off. The poor gob-shites have probably got themselves in more trouble by getting all of the guests names and addresses and infringing on their privacy. Imagine if you'd been on a dirty weekend away. Oops.

Reminded me of the weekend Catherine did the Dublin City marathon. We stayed in the City West Hotel and in a hilarious contrast of bookings, people were either competing in the Marathon or competing in the Darts Tourament in the Hotel. What a difference in body weights! The female darts supporters were either indistiguishable from the men or looked like street walkers. The muppets who run the hotel put runners and darts players on the same floors of the hotel. We went to bed at 9pm only to be regularly woken by fat cretins shouting ""let's play darts"". We had breakfast at 6am and I took great pleasure in shouting ""let's play darts, wankers"" on the way back to the room."
Eight years ago yesterday,We found out that Catherine was pregnant with our first baby. She gave up smoking that instant. I wussed out for 24 hrs  but eight years ago today I gave them up too. From 40 to zero overnight. One of the smartest things we ever did.
Ein Klein Nacht-Essen,"I'm really hitting the limit of my thirty words of German. Until recently, my experience of German cuisine has been limited to halbe-hanchen mit frites, Curry Wurst and Kartoffelklösse. And ya know, when booze is involved, there is nothing better. But as I mentioned [in my recent review](http://conoroneill.com/?p=145), Otto has changed my view of German cooking forever. 

Last weekend caused me to add several inches to my girth when the parents took me out on Friday and then they baby-sat on Saturday so myself and Catherine could go out.

So first the Friday and down for my second trip to Otto's with big sis and the old pair. However bad the cab journey was the first time, this was ten times worse with pea-soup fog. By the time we got there, Fi was green around the gills. Otto kindly made her a cup of peppermint tea which did the trick. The food was, once again, fabulous. To start, I had three types of smoked fish - Salmon, Mackerel and Tuna. The tuna was particularly lovely and reminded me of sashimi. Da had the same and the two women had a selection of dips which looked yum.

Mains were pretty lovely too. My venison was a little rich for my taste but was cooked and seasoned beautifully.  4 x Pear and Plum compote rounded off a great meal. The brutal weather and early winter darkness meant we couldn't go for a walk afterwards.  All are talking about the return trip already.

On Saturday, Catherine and I took a cab for our second visit to Casino House in Kilbrittain. This is a far more formal setting than Otto's and I guess they are aiming maybe for a Michelin star. 

The starters were a goat's cheese salad for Catherine and terrine for me. Both executed well but neither really overflowing with flavour. The polenta on Catherines added nothing to the taste and made the dish too heavy. 

Mains were a trio of fish for me - Hake, Sole and Swordfish. Beautifully cooked and very nice but again just a bit too subtle. Maybe that ten years of smoking in my twenties has killed too many taste buds. Catherine had monkfish and found the sauce too heavy and cloying. Desserts were yum but the lack of a star choccie dessert got negative marks from Cath. 

The service did give us a good laugh as we had a young girl who was on her first night and was struggling. She was very friendly and attentive but I had to bite my lip when she told me that my dessert consisted of a pear compost and pear sorbeT.

Maybe we were just unlucky with our choices but nothing leaped out at us. The last time was far more memorable. But I don't want to sound overly critical because the cooking is done with great skill and the value is fantastic compared to Dublin. It is also a great spot for B&B to tour the area (as is Otto's).

I'd recommend both to anyone who wants a bit of a treat. And the huge advantage they both have over restaurants in Dublin is the absence of poseurs. Both were full of ""normal"" people who appreciate good food.

Guten Appetit!"

This wasn't just me, this was, in their words, ""the Cork region"". Can anyone who has business broadband with Eircom in Cork confirm if they were down from midnight to 11.30am this morning? Are you going to sue?

Of course, we'll all be refunded the half-day downtime on our bill. Oh maybe not, it might affect the price they are acquired at by the latest suitor who sees an effective monopoly making shed-loads of money for old rope.

Elephant No-Show Shocker at Bandon Show,"<div style=""clear: both"" />Oisin O'Neill (3) of Old Chapel Bandon, registered his utter disgust this past Sunday over the non-appearence of elephants at the 2005 Bandon Summer Agricultural show. Proceedings have been served on Conor O'Neill (37), also of Old Chapel Bandon, for mis-leading advertising regarding the nature of the beasts which would appear at the show. Disappontment was also expressed over the lack of tigers.

On a positive note, none of the attending O'Neill family had ever seen bulls that large despite the elder family members having seen calves born in the farm across the road in Ratoath in 1972 at the age of 4\. Luckily no awkward questions arose over the size of the tackle on display.

Highlights of the show were the aforementioned bulls and cows, some fabulous horses, a genuine 1960's Ford Mustang (drool) and some fine loking tractors.

Lowlights were the goddammed rain, the frankly disturbing Punch and Judy show done in an indecipherable accent, the candy floss and the fact that Mickey Joe Harte did appear.

A special mention must go to the winner of the best hay in it's category. We live and learn.

Late breaking news: Oscar O'Neill (nearly 6), got first prize in writing in the ""nearly 6"" category. Would have been nice to know it had been submitted in advance! We belive €10 may be winging his way today.

Engage Arts Festival this weekend,"The second year of the Engage Arts festival is fast approaching and it looks fantastic. Something for everyone, no matter what their interests or age.

I've put together a simple mini-blog for the event over here [on Posterous](http://engage.posterous.com). The aim is that people can upload information, pictures, videos etc very easily over the weekend.It has the full line-up for the two days and contact details too.

It'd be fantastic if you'd take part in this exercise. It's as simple as emailing me on cwjoneill AT gmail DOT com.

Environmentally friendly investing,"Got this from my brother-in-law today:
> If you had purchased £1000 of Northern Rock shares one year ago it would now be worth £4.95, with HBOS, earlier this week your £1000 would have been worth £16.50, £1000 invested in XL Leisure would now be worth less than £5, but if you bought £1000 worth of Tennents Lager one year ago, drank it all, then took the empty cans to an aluminium re-cycling plant, you would get £214\. So based on the above statistics the best current investment advice is to drink heavily and re-cycle."
I'm more excited about Eoin Keith doing the Barkley Marathons than I am about my first 50 miler,"Like many people I've been enthralled by [Eoin Keith's](https://eoinkeith.wordpress.com/) Ultra running exploits since I first discovered this crazy sport. Whether it's his [Spine Race](https://thespinerace.com/) wins in crazy weather or his FKT from Mizen to Malin, he makes you want to push yourself and try things.

My wife and I are doing the Liverpool to Manchester 50 Mile Ultra very soon (oh god it really is very very soon) and we flip-flop between terror and huge excitement over the adventure. It's her first run further than a marathon (but she has 22 of those) and my first further than 50k. I've thought about little else for the past few months.

Again, like many people, one of the main triggers for us being interested in MUT (Mountain Ultra Trail) Running was the wonderful documentary [""The Barkley Marathons: The Race That Eats Its Young""](http://barkleymovie.com/). Anyone who visits us overnight is forced to watch it and is always shocked by how much they enjoy it.
{{< youtube 79IUKC9gS-8 >}}
&nbsp;

It's not just that it's considered one of the hardest races in the world, it's the wonderful mythology that's built up around it which makes it so exciting. That's mostly due to the personality of Gary Cantrell (aka Lazarus Lake) who organises several unusual and special races. In addition to Barkley, check out [Big's Backyard Ultra](https://trailrunnermag.com/people/culture/bigs-backyard-ultra-a-race-with-no-end.html), [A Race for The Ages](https://runsignup.com/Race/TN/Manchester/ARacefortheAges) and the 500km [Vol State Road Race](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=40620).

Despite the various documentaries and YouTube clips, none of us have any idea how difficult it must be for the competitors. We've only seen the start/finish line and a few famous places like the prison, the tower or ratjaw. But the fact that some of the toughest competitors in the world give up after one loop of five gives you some idea of what they are going through.

Once Barkley grabs you and you begin following various Ultra runners on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and blogs, you discover people like Jamil Coury, The Ginger Runner, John Kelly and Gary Robbins. Jam-Jam has done Barkley a few times but never finished. He's going again this year. [Follow his vlog](https://www.youtube.com/user/runsteepgethigh/videos). Gary, oh god Gary. If you don't know his story, go over to The Ginger Runner site and give Ethan a few quid and watch [""Where Dreams go to die""](https://wheredreamsgotodie.com/).
{{< youtube xgWejm_hbpA >}}
&nbsp;

Gary is also going to be back this year. You should [follow his vlog](https://www.youtube.com/user/robbinsg/videos) too.

Then yesterday [Eoin announced](https://eoinkeith.wordpress.com/2018/03/16/the-big-target-for-2018/) that he's doing Barkley this year. OMFG. I'm struggling to contain my excitement about this. Over the past 22 years, only 15 people have finished the race. No Irish person has. I'm not even sure an Irish person has taken part.

I think Eoin will finish. Not just because he's an amazing athlete who has the mental toughness to see it through, but also because he comes across as a very intelligent runner who won't make silly mistakes.

The only thing that could make this year's race more perfect is if [Carol Morgan](http://outsider.ie/challenges/carol-morgan-ultrarunner/) was competing too. No woman has ever finished Barkley. I can immediately think of two who could - [Amelia Boone](http://ameliabooneracing.com/) and Carol. I'd love to see them both try.

I know I'll be checking the news about his progress as he works his way around Frozen Head State Park. Possibly even whilst I'm out on my 50 mile cake-walk :-) Today I learned a new phrase: ""botanical pace"". That'll be us. I may have to put a temporary halt to my boycott of Twitter to follow [#BM100](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BM100) over the weekend.

Update 1: I just listened to [Ethan's excellent interview with Jamil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy4p__budj4) from last week. A lot of it covers his prep and hopes for Barkley. They also mentioned that Guillaume Calmettes [who won Big's Backyard Ultra 2017](https://ultrarunning.com/featured/one-more-hour-guillaume-calmettes-245-832-miles-at-big-dog-backyard-ultra/) is doing Barkley and you can see how much he has prepared [on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1356533).

Update 2: The race is underway and Eoin has finished one loop. But I also just discovered that [Stephanie Case](https://ultrarunnergirl.com/) and [Maggie Guterl](https://twitter.com/maggatronruns?lang=en) are running too. If I'd known that, I'd obviously have included them in the growing list of ""bad-ass women who can totally finish Barkley"". Fingers crossed for them all, it sounds like the weather conditions are horrendous.

Update 3: Well Barkleys 2018 is over and *no one* finished it! Unbelievably bad conditions meant that only one person even managed the fun run (Gary Robbins).
{{< youtube bT2fVKpT5A8 >}}
&nbsp;

What an amazing effort by everyone. One of the last people out on the course, but DNFed, was Guillaume Calmettes. I listened to a [superb Billy Yang podcast](http://billyyangpodcast.libsyn.com/guillaume-calmettes-byp-011) interview with him yesterday, driving home, whilst the race was still on. Give it a listen. He'll be running [Last One Standing](https://www.sientries.co.uk/event.php?elid=Y&event_id=4476) in Florence Court in Northern Ireland in September.

I can't wait to read Eoin's Barkley race report whenever his broken shoulder heals. I still think he's the man to finish it in 2019.

Update 4: A [set of short videos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Eoin-Keith-Athlete-1180273035349427/videos/) have been uploaded to Eoin's Facebook account. And I almost missed [Alexis Berg's](https://www.instagram.com/alexis_berg/) new video about Barkley as I thought it was in French! [La Barkley Sans Pitié](https://www.lequipe.fr/explore-video/020-la-barkley-sans-pitie/) is really worth a watch.

Update 5: Does Jamil ever rest? He has his video up after just a few days:

Excitement building over UTMB,"The organisers of [UTMB](https://utmbmontblanc.com/en/) (Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc) do an amazing job of the coverage every year. 

  

Head over to [their site](https://utmbmontblanc.com/en/live/utmb) at 5pm Irish on Friday Aug 31st for live footage at the race start. 

  

In the meantime here's a lovely video by Salomon of brilliant ultra runner Ryan Sandes and his buddies doing a tour of Mont Blanc.

Exciting reads for 7-year olds in Irish?,"Oscar is a bright kid who loves to read. His favourite novel is Le Catalogue d'Argos. In fact he loves the Horrid Henry series (and other similar ones). The only subject he is weak in is, surprise surprise, Irish. Unlike Oisín and Sibéal, he never went to Naoinra so started on it cold in junior infants. We're hoping to get him into Irish as a bit of a challenge but the books have to engage him.

Anyone out there have recommendations for good exciting reads in Irish for kids aged around 7? [Catherine found this site](http://www.obrien.ie/Category46.cfm) but most of those descriptions sound a bit boring e.g. where is Mamo's tooth? Does something old fashioned like the equivalent of The Secret Seven or Famous Five even exist in Irish?

Fabby Fashiony Fishy Fishy  ,"I've just had an absolutely perfect seafood lunch in Fishy Fishy with my parents. Incredible fresh seafood at reasonable prices with attentive staff. The only downside was an excess of ladies-who-lunch trying-too-hard.

I have never ever heard a bad word about the original Fishy Fishy. Everything about it sounded great except the small number of tables which resulted in long waits. As we are usually with-childer, that's not an option. My parents popped down for a visit and brought me out for lunch today to their new location looking out on the harbour. It's a lovely spot and the interior is just gorgeous. A pity they spent 20 minutes waiting for me at the original location which is back to being a shop again!

We arrived just before 12.30 expecting to queue but got seated right away. We took a relaxed pace and were there for well over an hour. It was absolutely jammed from 1pm onwards and the crowds never eased off. We probably brought the tone down a little since we were dressed normally unlike many who clearly thought they were guests of the Ambassador, given the high fashion on display.

The staff were brilliant throughout being attentive without being overbearing. They got my mum's main order wrong and could not have been more apologetic. A replacement arrived within five minutes (the advantage of serving ultra-fresh fish dishes which need little cooking).

Then the food, oh god the food. I decided to try things that were completely new to me. So it was clams to start and ray wings for main. I cannot praise them highly enough. I'm now a convert to both and will be looking to cook them myself. The clams were the non-razor sort and just sweet little nuggets of flesh in a lip-smacking asian-style broth. The ray wings simply pan-fried on a lovely scallion mash with a perfect sauce.

Mum skipped starters and went for a chilli seafood plate which she devoured. Dad started with avocado and prawns I think and had monkfish for main. All brilliant.

This is the sort of place every town in West Cork should have. The very best very freshest seafood cooked simply and cooked with skill. The massive crowds eating there shows that great businesses will be immune to the credit crunch. Speaking of which, the only real flaw in the place is that they don't accept credit cards. In 2008, that's just a bit mental. Giving us a customer feedback card at the end of the meal tells you what pros they are.

Facebook and You,"The stats around [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) in Ireland are staggering, they are racing towards 1 millions active users here. That just blows my mind. Some are predicting they'll have more pageviews globally than Google by next year!

Fancy a meal for two?,"I don't know a lot about wine and beer, but I know a man who does. Julian over at [Bubble Brothers](http://www.bubblebrothers.com/) has a nice competition on their blog. They import the gorgeous Japanese iKi beer (I had it in Wagamama a few months back) and are now supplying it to the Cafe Mao chain.

Fat Club Update,"The idea of relentlessly banging on about weight and fitness here and on Twitter didn't really work. There are only two people that I follow on Twitter doing it and one of them is my sister. But I have been marking major milestones and today was one of them.

So from Dec 29th to Feb 9th, I have lost 20 pounds.

How? No booze, no snacking, no sweets, normal breakfast, normal lunch, smaller dinner, fruit whenever I'm peckish and a small amount of treadmill Mon-Fri.

My BMI, body fat and visceral fat are all still atrocious but on the way down.

On advice from [@adventsparky](http://twitter.com/adventsparky) on Twitter, we invested in a body fat analysis machine (aka tarted up weighing scales) on Amazon. This [Omron BF510 Body Fat and Composition Bathroom Scales](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Omron-BF510-Composition-Bathroom-Scales/dp/B001N064JW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8ands=drugstoreandqid=1265707064andsr=1-1) has both feet pads and handgrips to give a much more accurate analysis of fat by running a small signal through your body.

![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MFy%2BPlvzL._SL500_AA280_.jpg ""Omron BF510"")

I then track that in a spreadsheet in Google Docs.

Next major milestone will be the 2 stone mark. I figure about another 2ish weeks for that.

Eventual aim is 4+ stone reduction by mid-late summer. Fingers crossed."
Favour from my  foreign  language expert readers,"We're playing around with some stuff on [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com) and we need as many translations as possible for the word ""review"" in the sense of ""a review of a movie"" or ""a review of a restaurant"". 

Ideally it should be a generic word that works in most situations. It would also be better if the words did not have accented characters (I'll explain that in a later post) and they must be in latin alphabet. We would like to get as many languages as possible but at the very least:

*   German (bericht?, meinung?)
*   French (revue? critique?)
*   Spanish (revision?)
*   Italian (rassegna?)
*   Portuguese
*   Danish
*   Dutch
*   Swedish
*   Norwegian
*   Finnish (viesti)
*   Estonian
*   Russian
*   Latvian
*   Lithuanian
*   Polish
*   Hungarian
*   Greek

Fax Spammers still allowed to operate with impunity in Ireland,"JD, one of the most prolific commenters on this blog, let me know about some fax spammers called Prism Fax badgering his elderly parents. It appears that the white elephant known as the Data Protection Commissioner was utterly useless in dealing with this.

Fenn's Quay is a gem,"This won't be a long review, it doesn't need to be. Fenn's Quay gave us a fantastic meal last Saturday night with wonderful service in a lovely room. You can't ask for more than that.

My lovely parents were down in Cork for the weekend for the GAA thingy and offered to bring Catherine and me out for a meal. We'd heard great things about Fenn's Quay from my sister and Julian Alubaidy and, wanting somewhere new to us, booked it.

Luckily we found parking at the door of the Mardyke and walked the few yards to the unassuming door. Inside was quite large and broken into two rooms. The service from the very first minute was friendly, light-hearted and helpful, exactly the way I like it.

I was thrilled to see they were quite busy for the entire night but that didn't impact on us at all. The menu had something for everyone but for whatever reason we all picked fish mains and 3/4 picked fish starters.

To go with the meal, diligent wine-student Catherine picked a lovely Sancerre which improved quickly with opening.

I need say little more other than to highlight that this is in the top tier of restaurants in the country and if you are in Cork it should be top of your list to try. Whilst other local establishments appear to be resting on their laurels, Fenn's Quay isn't letting-up for a minute. The pictures can do the rest of the talking.

Final Science Week Post: Best Invention of 2007?,"How many people are going to plump for the jesusphone in their posts? If Steve Jobs is responsible,it must be magic. Except it's not, it's a very nice UI on a phone design that was out of date in 2006 in Europe. So if not a fashion accessory then what? I think the [Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.ie/) people really mean ""new product"" when they say ""invention"", otherwise I'm going to have to go a read some science journals to find the latest cure for cancer.

2007 hasn't been a great year for ground-breaking innovation since most things I'm familiar with have just really been refined. I haven't heard about one thing that make me stop and go ""wow that's incredible"". I might do so when CUH stop sending out hand-written appointments and use a fancy thing called a computer and Microsoft Outlook to schedule x-rays.

I mentioned [BiancaMed](http://www.biancamed.com/) in a previous post and I'm going to nominate one of their developments as the Invention of 2007\. In fact their whole product line should get the gong. I don't just say this because I was in college with Conor Hanley and Conor Heneghan, their developments are the first step in an entirely new approach to medicine. Expect these guys to exit for a huge amount of money in the coming years (or buy [GE Healthcare](http://www.gehealthcare.com/)!).

The [BiancaMed Overnight Sleep Monitor](http://www.biancamed.com/solutions/sleep.php) sits on your bed-side locker and measures your breathing patterns with no contact whatsoever. It can provide critical data to diagnose sleep apnea and other sleep disorders and medical conditions. It will be able to send that information via mobile phone to a back-end system that your medical practitioner can log on to and analyse. It is genuinely revolutionary and there will be a multitude of spin-off products from this including baby monitors and fitness equipment.

As someone who has slept badly since he was 6 years old I'd love to get access to this and maybe finally get to the bottom of it. As a parent, I know many people will pay a LOT of money for a baby monitor which may help avoid SIDS.

A bit more impressive than a poxy phone, isn't it?"
Final words and stats on Flight EI123 and the death of the Aer Lingus brand,"I've been calling Twitter the Hate Machine and LinkedIn a Roach Motel for a long time. But they both really came up trumps with [my EI123 blogpost](https://conoroneill.com/2018/10/15/flight-ei123-and-the-death-of-the-aer-lingus-brand/).

![Leprechaun Airlines](/images/2018/10/leprechaun_airlines.jpg)

Unsurprisingly it turns out that IAG airlines have been treating passengers like garbage all over Europe and they are getting worse by the day. I received a large number of stories both publicly and privately that show a company which seems to detest the people who keep them in business.

The only contact I had from Aer Lingus was from a clearly under-resourced Head of Social Media. He was very helpful and ensured our statutory compensation claim was expedited. Others who didn't make my level of noise are still waiting for their claim to be processed.

## Go Shannon Go

The main positive outcome for me was re-discovering Shannon airport via several recommendations. Despite the horrible N20 drive (which is actually not too bad early on a Sunday morning), every other aspect of getting to/from Raleigh was fantastic. A one minute walk from the car to the terminal. No queue in security. Maybe 10 people in the Pre-Clearance queue. Nice flight via United to Newark which has improved immensely since I was last there in 1998. The onward flight to Raleigh took much less time than quoted. On the return leg, I barely waited 5 minutes for my bag in Shannon. Then on the road to Cork in another 2 minutes.

I can't recommend Shannon highly enough. I heard a United flight attendant telling a passenger that the Newark route had been a huge success for them this year. Unfortunately it is shutting down for the winter. So Shannon is clearly still heavily reliant on tourism traffic. Given the number of people talking about avoiding Dublin at all costs when on both flights, the airlines in Shannon need to promote it more for business travel. And roll on the M20.

## Show me the numbers

This was the bit that really shocked me. Whilst I still have plenty of followers on Twitter despite my absence, I barely ever use LinkedIn and didn't expect much of a response. Ditto Facebook. Boy was I wrong about LinkedIn!!

So here are the raw numbers:

### Blog post itself

The stat that blew my mind here was the average time spent reading [the post](https://conoroneill.com/2018/10/15/flight-ei123-and-the-death-of-the-aer-lingus-brand/). In the first few days it was 12 minutes! I struggle to read anything longer than about 5 minutes so thank you all for your attention! A lesson for media outlets that when people care about what they are reading, they stay engaged. Also you should curse more.

![Google Analytics](/images/2018/10/ga_stats.png)

### Twitter

I started [with Twitter](https://twitter.com/conoro/status/1051735571201253377) and found it interesting that, despite few retweets, the views just kept on coming. They are just about to hit 10,000.

![Twitter](/images/2018/10/twitter_stats.png)

### Facebook

Facebook [saw little interaction](https://www.facebook.com/conoroneill/posts/656591949943) but the 12 shares included some very influential people (thanks Frank!), which means it drove similar levels of traffic to the blog as the others.

![Facebook](/images/2018/10/facebook_stats.png)

### LinkedIn - The site that keeps on giving

Wow. [Just wow](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6457894659648733184). Not only is it about to go over 15,000 views, 487 of them are from CEOs or equivalent level. It also seems to have been shared privately by many, as I was contacted by multiple people I don't know to tell me similar stories of horror from IAG companies. Including one person who was on the original EI123 but managed to escape via another airline to Chicago.

![LinkedIn](/images/2018/10/linkedin_stats.png)

I've also had several people tell me that they continue to see the post via their contacts. It's extremely interesting that in a social media world with the attention span of a goldfish, my post has had some longevity. People are clearly sick to death of IAG's behavior.

That's the first thing I've ever written where the majority of the traffic came from LinkedIn instead of Twitter.

![Google Analytics](/images/2018/10/ga_stats_02.png)

### Others

I'm sure I could drive another bunch of traffic to the site if I posted it to boards.ie or Reddit. I might still. I even half-jokingly considered using some of our compo to pay for a Promoted Tweet campaign. But it didn't look like very good value.

## Final words

I don't know if there is anyone in Aer Lingus who thinks that great customer service can be a differentiator. It's quite clear from everything I've learned over the past few weeks that the spreadsheet jockeys running IAG are destroying the Aer Lingus brand with each passing day and people are beginning to actively avoid all IAG airlines. By the time it starts affecting the bottom line, causing them to pay attention, it'll already be too late.

Finally, I almost admire the balls on the marketing people [who posted this on the 29th](https://twitter.com/AerLingus/status/1057045886340075520). ""Aer Lingus, we love Chicago-bound Irish rugby players. Irish runners, on the other hand, can go fuck themselves"". Presumably the same geniuses responsible [for this](https://simpleflying.com/aer-lingus-films-x-factor-contestants-in-misleading-business-cabin-then-moves-them-back-to-economy/). #AerSleazeus"
Finally a reason you should join Twitter -> @CorkAirport,"I know I said I'd keep most of the tech over on [conoroneill.net](http://conoroneill.net/) but I had to share this with a wider audience. If you've read this blog over the past few years, you'll have seen me banging on about Twitter a lot (particularly way back in 2007). The bulk of the population remains to be convinced of its utility so my usual answer to people wondering why they should join is that it's the ultimate news source. Watching stories as they break without having to rely on those jobsworths in RTE News (the bailout coverage was their worst day's work in 84 years) still excites me.

But now I have an even better reason for Munster residents to sign-up. [Cork Airport is now on Twitter](http://twitter.com/corkairport) and they are doing an absolutely amazing job. Fully up-to-the-minute information on delays, cancellations, closures and more. No more hoping the web-site has been updated or sitting on hold trying to find out if your flight is leaving on-time. If you travel much through the airport, join Twitter now and follow even that one account.

Finally something to add to my Scouting trophies,"I still have the shakes and I don't think it's all drink related. Truly, madly, deeply stunned to win [Best Blog Post](http://awards.ie/blogawards/?p=139) at the awards last night. Thanks a million times over to all of you who voted for me. It was a bloody brilliant night overall and the highlight was Bernie refusing to take the ""Best Contribution to the Irish Bloggersphere"" award and giving it to Damien instead. A well deserved standing ovation ensued.

Damien manages to have that killer combination of idealism and pragmatism which enables him to come up with a constant stream of great ideas and then execute on them. Where most of us think ""wouldn't it be great if **someone** did X"" , Damien just thinks ""let's do it"".   Thanks Damien.

I was thrilled to meet tons of people whose blogs I read daily. In particular I loved running into [Sweary](http://arseendofireland.blogspot.com/), [FeeBee](http://2weekwait.blogspot.com/) and [Roos](http://www.onebreastless.com/). Sweary is just an awesome blogger and both FeeBee and Roos write what I consider to be extremely important blogs with the ability to profoundly impact peoples lives in a positive way by demystifying what they are going through. I'm genuinely disappointed that none of them got an award last night.

On the subject of Sweary, I hope I didn't bore the arse of TSG as I was polluted by the time I headed over to talk to them. I was very happy to hear that Tom out-danced me after I went to bed as I'm having flashbacks to some of my moves and they were not pretty.

Apologies to anyone who I talked drunken nonsense to, I'm nothing like that in real life ;-)

Well done to all the winners and all those who were shortlisted. Damn that was a good night even if I was in bed by midnight......I think."

First Flock Fiddling,"Having a look at the [Flock ](http://www.flock.com/)browser to see if it is much cop. So far not bowled away at all. This is a test post from its blogging feature. The whole integration thing just isn't as slick as I was expecting.

More importantly, I have setup the ""[Subscribe-to-Comments](http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/)"" plug-in. So now if you add a comment, you can get notified by e-mail if someone else replies. It saves you having to constantly re-check.

Flight EI123 and the death of the Aer Lingus brand,"Buckle up, this is going to be the rantiest rant I've written in years. It's mostly about getting it off my chest as, based on our experiences over October 5th and 6th, it will have zero effect on the dire state of Aer Lingus.

Let's do the timeline first and then dive into the death of once-well-regarded brand.

### An early start but lots of excitement

My wife, 5 kids and I woke at 4.30am in Bandon on Friday October 5th to go to Chicago for our mini ""summer"" holiday and for the Chicago Marathon. This was the first time any of the kids had ever been to America and their excitement had been growing for months. We were only going for 5 days so we aimed to cram a lot in.

We arrived at the Red Car Park in Dublin airport around 9.00am after a toughish drive in the dark and rain.

### Pre-clearance - what's the point?

Initially everything went relatively well despite the insane queues for pre-clearance which had us stressed that we'd miss the flight. I've done an equal split of flights to the US via Dublin and Heathrow over the past few years. Only once has pre-clearance been quick. I've never queued for more than 45 minutes in the US via LHR. And they've heard of air-conditioning in US airports. I just don't get the value proposition of Dublin any more. And after last weekend, all of my US flights will be ORK-LHR-\* from now on if possible.

In any case, we ran from the DHS agents to the gate and were relieved to see the gate was still open. People continued to dribble in for at least another 20 minutes. The plane was filled with people taking part in the marathon on Sunday. Some estimates put it at up to 100 runners out of 300ish total.

### Your flight is delayed due to faulty equipment

The planned departure time at 11.30am passed without comment but the main door was still open. After more delay, the pilot informed us that the navigation system was malfunctioning and was being replaced. No big deal, we all thought. Cue jokes about giving them our phones and using them for navigation. Eventually after approx 2hrs, the pilot announced that the replacement part and full plane reboot hadn't worked. The plane was going nowhere and the flight crew were outside of their working window.

Everyone was deeply disappointed but accepted that shit happens and things break down.

Now we just needed a plan B from Aer Lingus. A big worry was that we'd arrive too late for the race number collection on Saturday and therefore not be allowed to run on Sunday.

### 5hrs on a plane on the ground

It was at this point that the clusterfuck began.

Aer Lingus proceeded to provide _zero_ information to passengers for hours. Even the pilot was getting extremely frustrated. We still have no idea what the hell was going on during this phase of the hellfest. What we were sure of was that there wasn't another A330 just idling around the back of Hangar 6.

We sat there until after 4pm. Yup, close to 5hrs sitting on a plane being offered sips of water.

That pointless delay meant that no one could arrange alternative flights via LHR/AMS/CDG.

The main meal was offered without the hot bit. The timing of this was obviously to make sure they weren't on the hook for food vouchers, as almost immediately afterwards, without warning, we're all told to disembark. Still without any actual information being provided by ground staff.

### Communications, what's that?

Everyone assumed we'd now get told what the plan was. Hah, LOL. More delays, more waiting. At least now there were promises of updates. Which didn't occur. Of course no food vouchers were offered because didn't they feed us a slice of brown bread, mini pasta salad and chocolate mousse already?

{{< tweet 1048258048052154368 >}}

Finally around 6.30pm they officially cancelled the flight and told us a replacement flight was being arranged for Saturday. A moment of happiness which was immediately killed when they said that flight would be at 3pm. There was a roar of frustration from the now utterly exhausted passengers. No sorry, actually, we meant 4pm. Jesus they can't even get the flight time right.

100+ marathoners started wondering if there was any point in even flying.

But our day wasn't over yet. Oh no.

The organisational geniuses then told us we'd have to queue for new boarding passes for tomorrow. We queued for 2.5 hours to get that boarding pass. They had 2 people and one ticket printer and they printed off each ticket one by one as each passenger presented themselves. We wanted to scream in frustration. Just as we got to the top of the line, one of them says to the other ""maybe we should open another gate?"". After 2.5hrs, this brainwave struck her?

### Rent-a-heavy

It was during this phase of the wait that the nastiest aspect of the experience occurred. Three Airport ""Police"" in their faux-SWAT gear arrived. No passenger had been obnoxious. No one was acting in a threatening manner. If anything, I thought we were all ridiculously polite in the face of relentless incompetence. One of those three then stood at the side of the queue looking extremely intimidating, staring people out. The other two were wall flowers at the back.

If your solution to the complete incompetence and ineptitude of your systems, processes and people is to call rent-a-heavy, you're doing everything wrong.

### The Citywest Hotel, Dublin Airport

[Sports Travel International](https://sportstravelinternational.com/) could teach all of Aer Lingus how to do customer service and communications. We have used them to do the London and New York Marathons. We're also using them for Boston next year. We didn't use them for Chicago due to all of the kids and it being a combined race/holiday trip. But the superb Martin Joyce didn't differentiate between those who were travelling with him and those who weren't. He found out exactly what we'd need to do in order to collect our race numbers at 5.30am on Sunday morning and then got on the tannoy to tell us all. I can only imagine how garbled that message would have been from Aer Lingus. If you want to do an international marathon I can't recommend Martin and his team enough. Absolute professionals who deserve all of your business. I can only hope he doesn't use Aer Lingus for Boston next year. I'd happily take Norwegian out of Cork to Providence. But of course IAG intends to acquire Norwegian and ruin them too.

After we got the boarding passes and collected our luggage, we headed downstairs to be told which of the airport hotels we'd be shuttled to for the night. It was now nearly 9pm. I was completely shattered. What did we find? Another goddammed queue with another two staff members trying to handle everything.

They told us a bare-faced lie that the airport hotels were now full. Unfortunately for them, one of the passengers had just rung the hotels direct. They had plenty of rooms. Aer Lingus were clearly just not willing to pay the room rate.

Where did they send us? Citywest! Over 30 minutes away on a bus. Other people on the bus were checking out flights via Heathrow and seemed willing to spend over €2000 for a one-way flight in order to extract themselves from the clutches of Aer Lingus.

Oh holy cow, I just heard that one of our neighbours was put up in a hotel in **Gorey** recently by Aer Lingus after a cancelled flight. That's 111km away!

More than twelve hours after we arrived in the airport, we finally got to leave.

The Citywest Hotel could teach Aer Lingus a few things about dealing with groups of people. They had all of the key-cards ready when we arrived. In two ticks they got us adjoining rooms. They had signs with information about the return bus back to the airport and they had food (albeit pretty awful) ready and waiting. We wolfed down some of the food and hit the sack. I was honestly ready to give up and go home at this stage.

The Comfort Suites on North Michigan Avenue could teach Aer Lingus a few things about customer service too. My wife rang to tell them we wouldn't make it that day but to please hold on to our booking. Not only did they hold on to the booking, they decided (unprompted) not to charge us for that first night despite there being zero chance of them renting it out with such short notice.

Just to make the day perfect, some dumb darts-playing fuck set off the fire alarm twice in the hotel at 2.30am. Twice in one day that I had murder on my mind.

After a big breakfast, we booked a large taxi and got ourselves to the airport as early as possible. Under no circumstances were we going to take the shuttle bus back and get into another damned queue with all of the other Citywest passengers.

We asked each other as we headed around the M50 ""I wonder how they can screw things up today?"". Oh in many many ways.

### My favourite error - UserExceptionError

Up to the self-service baggage tagging machine we went and scanned the first boarding pass ""UserExceptionError"". Second one - ""UserExceptionError"". And so on.

Are you fucking kidding me? Did we really wait 2.5hrs in a queue the previous night for a set of boarding passes that didn't work??????

Oh yes we did.

Over to one of the ground staff. She prints out 7 more boarding passes.

Back to the machine.

- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""
- ""UserExceptionError""

![Fist of death](/images/2018/10/dilbert_fist_of_death.jpg)
&nbsp;

We were brought up to the counter so that the staff could check in the bags for us and issue the third set of boarding passes.

### We process 10,000 carcasses a day

And here we finally get to one of the key reasons why we are being treated like cattle heading to an abattoir rather than human beings. An older, presumably senior staff member was there. I quietly passed comment that ""you know 300 other people are going to have to go through this?"". To which he boasted ""we process 10000 people a day, we can handle 300"". Holy shit, clue-meter reads zero. He had managed to completely miss the point. He didn't give a damn that 300 frustrated tired stressed people would be going through the same ridiculous rigmarole, he thought that the whole process was all about Aer Lingus's needs. How can anyone in a customer facing role think and communicate like this in 2018? But I don't blame him. More on that later.

Beside us was a family with a tiny baby. They were simply asking for either a bassinet or the assurance of an empty seat beside them. Stony faced refusal to guarantee anything. The grandmother was made of stern stuff tho and rightly hounded them. ""You expect us to hold a baby for 8 hours on a plane?"". The robots were unmoved.

Another person was crying.

Another person missed a special party being thrown in her honour.

Another family also had a tiny baby.

People who'd paid for Business Class customer service stood mouth agape.

Stoney faces in response. Computer says no.

{{< youtube D4A18tUUb2Y >}}
&nbsp;

We had to go through the pre-clearance hellscape again. Luckily it flowed a bit quicker. We had lots of time to spare and hung around the gate in case there were any more surprises.

Which of course there were.

### We apologise for any inconvenience caused

The scheduling geniuses in Aer Lingus put our flight on an hour before an existing scheduled flight to Chicago. We should have known things were about to go wrong again when three more Airport Police heavies arrived. The youngfella on the desk barked into the tannoy ""Welcome to Aer Lingus flight EI1123. Due to an issue with catering, this flight is delayed. We apologise for any inconvenience. Click"". A massive roar erupted from all the passengers. They may as well have used a Dalek to deliver that message. The heavies were on standby. Several more delay announcements ensued.

You have fucked with 300 people non-stop for more than 24hrs and you make zero attempt to get things right on day 2 or show even the tiniest bit of humanity? It was quite clear that all of their focus, including the catering, was on the scheduled flight. Which of course managed to leave before us.

Finally we began boarding. Dalek-boy continued barking out updates over the tannoy. He then did a full-on Meet The Parents scene, continuing to board by row number, despite the departure gate being completely empty. I see that Gaylord Focker was going to Chicago too.

{{< youtube v6FK2RmVgGE >}}
&nbsp;

### Oh you wanted a seat with your ticket?

We finally got on the white charter [A340-300 | 9H-FOX from HiFly](http://www.hifly.aero/en/a340/9h-fox.html). Whilst I hadn't relaxed yet (did I mention my entire neck and shoulder was seized with stress since the previous night?), I thought we were finally done with the stupidity.

Silly Conor, there weren't done messing with us yet. Wait for it - Aer Lingus had assigned my wife and four of my kids seats that did not exist on this plane. The flight attendants said they didn't think there were any spare seats. My wife was really starting to panic but kept it from the kids.

How in the name of fuck can you not know the layout of the plane you have just chartered? How can every one of you be so utterly useless at every single step of this process? Your planes break down every day (more on that later) so how can all of this seem to be such an apparently unique situation to you?

After everyone boarded, seats were found for my family, as plenty of people had either given up on the trip in disgust/frustration or had arranged alternative flights. I think/hope the people with babies were also sorted out by the Portuguese charter staff.

I didn't sleep. The rage kept me awake. Also the slop they now serve as an in-flight meal on transatlantic flights. The kids were utterly dejected at this stage. So much for their amazing holiday to the USA. The name Aer Lingus was now dirt to them. You might as well have renamed it Trump Airlines, they were so disgusted with how everything had gone.

### Arrival

We landed. Down to baggage reclaim. As one last fuck-you, the baggage from the two Aer Lingus flights and a Frontier flight were all on the same tiny carousel. Hundreds of people milled around. Can you explain the benefits of Dublin pre-clearance to me again? After another long wait, we got two cabs to the hotel.

It was now late local time. We trotted out to the closest convenience store, a 7-11, bought some shitty sandwiches, gobbled them down, and went to bed. The rage was still pulsating and I was seriously considering not running the following day due to exhaustion and stress.

After a few restless hours sleep, we got up at 4.30am and jogged in the rain down to the late-number-pickup office in the Hilton. Most people there were from our flight. The staff/volunteers could not have been nicer.

### The Chicago Marathon

A decent bite in Pret (first tasty food in 48 hours) and we went back to the Comfort Suites to relax (aka stress out) for a bit. We then walked down to our starting corral and finally began cheering-up and feeling the amazing buzz from everyone around us.

Dropping and smashing my phone did not help however.

And then we were off.

I went out far too fast, mostly fueled by the burning rage of 1000 suns towards Aer Lingus. But unfortunately rage can't make up for a complete lack of sleep, exhaustion and being completely stressed out. Instead of getting my hoped-for personal best, I just got around in the usual time. However the rage helped keep me going during the eight middle miles of nausea which were probably stress related too.

We finished, gulped down the free can of beer, walked back to the Comfort Suites, showered and headed out with the children to start our summer holiday which was now 20% shorter.

A brilliant few days ensued and I highly recommend visiting Chicago. Via a different airline obviously.

The return trip was uneventful. Thank fuck.

A big congratulations to everyone on that flight who finished the marathon. 20 Irish people did sub 3hrs. If any of those were on EI123, you are legends. Mark Smith of Eagle AC in Cork finished in a time of 2h 34m 21s.

### Honourable Mentions

I would like to mention those Aer Lingus staff who showed some empathy towards the 300 passengers - specifically the captain of the original flight and the flight attendant who is also a runner and knew what a huge blow all of this was to her fellow athletes.

I did not hear the word ""sorry"" outside of that, apart from the classic legal-speak ""we're sorry to hear that"".

### What does Aer Lingus stand for in 2018?

Now let's talk about the bigger picture and how _""Shite But Not Cheap""_ is not a long-term sustainable business model for Aer Lingus.

I mentioned several times that I didn't necessarily blame the individual staff for the EI123 fiasco. I still don't know how much was incompetence and how much was the obnoxious Standard Operating Procedures. In either case it's a management failure. The rot starts at the top. Either the staff aren't trained correctly, are chronically understaffed, their support systems are missing, or the SOPs are now so anti-customer as to be offensive.

The outgoing CEO of Aer Lingus talked recently about the success of their value model. Do they really think they are the value option in comparison to actual low-cost airlines? Check any route and compare Aer Lingus to the real value options. They are often 2x or 3x the price. So what exactly are we paying for apart from the semi-state legacy? Horrendous customer service, unreliable planes, food slop that costs them a max of €2 per head and some movies on a small old LCD?

I loved their ridiculously misguided tweet when Norwegian launched from Cork and Shannon:

{{< tweet 834802022096498689 >}}

Now let's rewrite that the other way, to be accurate:

- Overpriced ticket with bag included?
- Seat row number that doesn't actually exist on your plane?
- Included slop you wouldn't feed your cat?
- Pre-clearance that takes 1.5 hours to get through?

Cheers Aer Lingus, you're grand. I'll take a genuinely cheap flight, my own sandwich, podcasts and Netflix offline any day.

Side-note biz idea: Deliveroo/UberEats to the Gate. Impossible with modern airport security but damn that would be awesome.

As I said above ""Shite But Not Cheap"" is not sustainable. The one thing Aer Lingus used to stand for was high quality transatlantic service. You knew they had your back. If things went wrong, they'd be all over it to make sure you got to where you needed to go. You were confident and relaxed in your travel. Everyone was good-natured and friendly. You relied on them.

Most of all you felt like you were dealing with humans in the past. Now it feels like a bunch of robots who have had stock phrases and responses drilled into them and where ""operational efficiency"" is the only metric by which they are measured.

Why would anyone choose Aer Lingus over a genuine discount carrier now? A misguided sense of patriotism?

The dead heart of the Aer Lingus brand was really driven home to me by the contrast of the all-white charter plane and the nearby Rugby-player-liveried plane. On the one hand you had the faceless brandless plane of HiFly which was going to take 100 brutalised exhausted athletes to their marathon. On the other you had some marketing bullshit about how much Aer Lingus supports our rugby players.

An honest Aer Lingus livery would be all-white. ""Aer Lingus, we stand for nothing, except profit margin.""

I was reminded of brand values again on our drive back to Cork when we stopped at the Motorway Services near Rathdowney. Like all the other Topaz garages, it has recently been rebranded with the hilariously awful Circle-K design from North America. Like something you'd expect to see in Deliverance. So this huge amount of money has been spent on making all the garages looking ""right"". But when I went to the restrooms, the seat was falling off the toilet.

These conglomerates all share the same mindset. As long as it looks pretty on the surface, who cares if it's a shitshow underneath. Or to use the most accurate description - lipstick on a pig.

### Customer Service (again)

Any company that uses the phrase ""we apologise for any inconvenience caused"" when things go wrong, is telling you in no uncertain terms ""give us your money, shut the fuck up, we don't care"". It's the language of the legal department.

A real highlight of the trip was this accidental comedy routine from the Aer Lingus social media team.

![Aer Sleazeus](/images/2018/10/aer_sleazeus.jpg)

{{< tweet 1049283189213224960 >}}

Modern tech companies understand that the most important thing to do during an ""outage"" is to communicate. What's happening as it happens. ETAs for fixes. Explanations. Realtime updates. And then published post-mortems and commitments around how they are going to avoid the problem in the future and what they have already changed.

Not vague lies about passing it on for internal review.

Aer Lingus is stuck in some 1960s timewarp where passengers are to be treated like idiot mushrooms and the internet was never invented. They seem to be basing their biz model on the worst of US airline behaviour. Why would you use 50 year old business models unless you are completely out of ideas?

And just to show that nothing works in there, what did they do this week? They sent us a customer satisfaction survey about the _cancelled_ flight.

### Ireland's National Airline - Ryanair

Ryanair is the national airline. Aer Lingus is a Stage Oirish regional branch of a Anglo-Spanish multinational. You can only fool some of the people some of the time. I feel particularly sorry for old Americans who still think it's the classic Aer Lingus and are expecting Darby O'Gill and The Little People. Instead they get this:

![Leprechaun](/images/2018/10/leprechaun-warwick-davis.jpg)
&nbsp;

Internet word of mouth is fast and brutal. This is going to catch up on Aer Lingus sooner rather than later.

Remember all those idiots who fought to make sure Ryanair, the most successful airline in Europe, wouldn't get their hands on Aer Lingus, in case they'd ruin it? Same idiots who told us not to be talking down the economy in 2008. Same idiots who spent €160m on a white elephant terminal in Cork instead of increasing the number of flights/destinations. Official Ireland. All surface, no depth. Enjoy your slop on your next Paddy's Day flight.

When you fly with a genuinely low-cost airline like Ryanair, the understanding is clear. I pay you almost no money, you provide me with a flying-bus and zero customer service. And if shit happens, well, I paid you almost no money.

In contrast, we paid Aer Lingus over €3700 for our flights. That's a different understanding and a different expectation. If I'd paid Business Class on Oct 5th, I'd currently be looking into legal options beyond statutory compensation. Particularly if I was that elderly couple in Business Class who were forced to haul their heavy bags out to a bus and stay in Citywest. The Merrion it ain't.

### Incident Management

If Aer Lingus wants to join the 21st century, they need to publish how their incident management system works. Based on Oct 5th, I strongly suspect they don't have one. Hence all the headless chickens and complete lack of comms or joined-up processes. Naive me thought their multi-million euro Enterprise Service Bus from IBM would enable a whole new generation of systems and processes in the airline. Not UserExceptionError.

As soon as they knew the navigation system was faulty, incident/exception management should have kicked in with a single person in charge of the entire situation (no not ""Johnny"" in a hi-vis) with formal handovers as shifts ended. That person would be the single point of contact and coordination. A passenger liaison on the ground would work with them to ensure all passengers knew immediately what what happening and what the plans were. Not some clueless youngfella promising over the tannoy that we'd have a ""substantial"" update in 40 minutes after 7 hours of waiting. An update which of course came after more than an hour.

""Everyone"" has a smartphone in 2018. Everyone has a phone. Most people have the internet. We should have been getting timely updates (once every 30 minutes) on exactly what each delay was about and what they were doing. And if the update was ""we're busting our balls here trying to get a charter plane to Dublin tomorrow so you can get to your marathon, it's proving very difficult on a Friday afternoon. No we haven't all pissed off to Nora's going-away do in the Radisson Blu"", everyone would have been grateful and relaxed just a little bit because of the clarity and honesty.

Information is power. When people feel powerless, they get frustrated and angry. This is a fundamental problem in most airlines and airports still. And most of it is easily solvable with current technology. You just have to commit to communicating rather than calling rent-a-heavy.

Actually, I'll send you what we're working on for an event in early November when it's ready. It'd be perfect for airlines/airports. And all Open Source so it won't cost you cheapskates a penny. No internet access needed.

Realtime comms is what your airline app could facilitate. Again it's 2018. But IT was one area where they recently boasted they had saved money. Oh bless, no one in Aer Lingus got the memo - [All companies are technology companies now](https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/all-companies-are-technology-companies-now/). Maybe don't lowball the people writing your apps. And yes I used to work for FeedHenry. So I know.

The fact that your Aer Lingus online account has no connection to the online check-in process shows just how prehistoric their systems are. The former can't even pass the reference number to the latter when you go to check-in. Top programming tip, use: ?ref_num=XYZ123

I completely understand that running the operations side of an airline is very very hard. It amazes me how well it works most of the time. And it requires everyone to be efficient. But that's table stakes, all airlines have to be able to do it. It's how you act when things go wrong that define the quality of your organisation/systems/processes. And that's where Aer Lingus is clearly completely broken.

### Cost Savings

In their most recent annual results announcement, Aer Lingus stated that ""it saw significant cost savings through efficient growth with higher productivity and from cost initiatives. This included areas such as maintenance, selling and IT. ""

EI123 on October 5th was the outcome of those cost savings. From the broken down plane to the non-existent customer service to the UserExceptionError. I spotted on Twitter that other passengers had cancellations/delays to/from Chicago on the 4th and the 9th. If that was St Munchin in every case, then it's not fit for flying.

{{< tweet 1050091952547475457 >}}

Anecdotally from people I talk to, Aer Lingus planes seem to be breaking down a _lot_. Maybe don't try to save money on maintenance. Because we all know what the final outcome of that will be. My 50th birthday was almost ruined when, on my previous flight from the US, the Aer Lingus LHR-ORK leg was cancelled due to breakdown, followed by another customer service fiasco in DUB.

Are breakdown statistics published anywhere? Most of the data I've seen is US-based and mostly about delays. There are some interesting stats on [European cancellations here](https://www.flightstats.com/v2/global-cancellations-and-delays). IAG-owned airlines, including Aer Lingus, are very prominent.

### Final Words

As I said earlier, the rot in any organisation starts at the top. I see the outgoing CEO stated ""By any objective measure Aer Lingus has been successful in recent years and continues to have significant opportunity to build upon the strong fundamentals of our value model"". Any objective measure except customer service, IT and maintenance.

If you treat customer service as a cost to be minimised, you are on the way to being disrupted. Those who can't compete on price have to use customer service as a differentiator. What else is there for Aer Lingus to use now? Watching BA plummet to near the bottom of customer satisfaction surveys is a preview of what's going to happen to Aer Lingus soon without a fundamental change in attitude (management).

IAG's numbers have been great over the past couple of years. I don't know how much of that revenue growth has been due to the increase in numbers of people flying globally in general or due to M&A. How much non-M&A market share growth have they had? Same question about market share for Aer Lingus. Everything was going gangbusters in 2007 too. When it all goes bang again (hello Italy), which airlines will survive?

I honestly can't wait for the next generation of airlines to come along and wipe out these 20th century dinosaurs. They'll be forgotten in an instant. Does anyone under 40 remember TWA? Exactly.

I've just found out that my next US flight is in a week. I'll obviously be taking the safer option of ORK-LHR-RDU. Sadly that first leg will have to be with the dreaded green leprechaun.

I'll leave the final word to my 11yo daughter who created this on her phone on day 2 as we entered the even longer pre-clearance queue:

Food and Health,"I got an email during the week from Mary Wedel who runs the brilliant [An Tobairín](http://www.antobairin.com/) Health Food Shop in Bandon. We've watched Mary grow this business since we arrived here from a pokey place on North Main Street to the bigger one on Factory Lane to the current flagship on South Main Street. I see no reason why she won't be as successful as [Whole Foods Market](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/) in the US.

![](http://www.antobairin.com/front260.jpg)

The range of products on sale there has always amazed me. From vitamins to organic food, chocolate, cosmetics and alt-med stuff, she has something for everyone. Now I'll be totally open here, I'm not a fan of a large number of alt-med approaches despite having a friend who is a homeopath. However, having said that, there is a huge amount to be gained in the area of health by everyone thinking about the products they use on their bodies, and more importantly, the things they eat.

So her new project, the [Fionnuisce](http://www.natural-health.ie/) Healing Centre (web-site not live yet) in Heron Court on Market Quay holds great interest for me. Apart from the alt-med side, there is a large meeting room with a demonstration kitchen area. So far this space has been used for yoga, dance and various workshops including cookery demonstrations in co-operation with Karen Austin of legendary [Lettercollum Kitchen Project](http://www.lettercollum.ie/).

There are lots of interesting cookery events lined up for September that include a Sushi Saturday and Mediterranean Veg.  In October Karen will offer Indian Vegetarian, November Thai and December Christmas Veg.  There will be a wholefood cookery night class running Tuesdays from 1st week in October for 10 weeks with Dorothee Clarke.

She had me at sushi :-)

They are also running a cool 1-day drama workshop on Sunday 13th July by Belinda Wild who describes it as being for anyone with or without experience in Drama who is interested in exploring creative self-expression through the medium of theater - and she guarantees to make you laugh. I'd honestly be tempted, having played  Sybil Walling in ""Brush with a Body"" in the Kieran's College school play, aged 17.

If you are interested in any of the above, shoot Mary a TXT on 086-3882440\. I'm trying to convince her to start a blog since I think any place that has regular events is ideally suited to one instead of a static brochure page. It might be worth her putting all the events up on [Yahoo Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/) too.

UPDATE: Some of the dates for the foodie events are as follows:

*   Saturday 6th September, Succulent Sushi with Delwyn Klevenow
*   Suturday 20th September, Mediterranean Vegetables from Karen Austin's abundant garden
*   Saturday 18th October, Indian Vegetarian with Lettercollum Karen
*   Saturday 15th November, Thai Cookery with Lettercollum Karen
*   Saturday 12th December, Vegetarian Christmas with Karen"

Food Timeline,"[Marc Canter](http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/04/next-round-of-interesting-links-early-april-06) has a nice link over to a [Food Time Line](http://www.foodtimeline.org/) showing the when, why and what of a bunch of different foods like ice-cream, french onion soup and worcestershire sauce. Well worth a read if you ever wondered when things like fish and chips became popular.

Foodie Podcasts - From truffles to roadkill,"UPDATE 1: I am re-publishing this post as I did a great dis-service to Adam over at [Men In Aprons](http://www.meninaprons.net/) by confusing his Podcast with another one. MIA is a lighthearted foodie podcast where Adam is the main presenter and he riffs with his wife and friends in the room about food related topics. Adam sent me a great e-mail describing some of the background to MIA and I have to say I really like his attitude and approach. So, not only do I recommend that you check out MIA and see if it is to your liking but I have re-subscribed too.

Whilst I am at it, anyone else out there using Juice for Podcast downloads?

Original Post:

Since about November, I've been listening to some (mainly foodie) podcasts. As someone who thinks Steve Jobs' real name is Damien and is the spawn of a wolf, it is a case of ipod schmipod for me.

My first set-up was my Nokia 6230 with a 512MB MMC Card and the standard Nokia headphones. The biggest drawback of it is that the transfer of music or podcasts via Bluetooth takes forever and USB isn't great either. So I end up removing the MMC from the phone, popping it into my laptop, copying what I want and then re-assembling the phone. For cycling this setup worked fine.

The music player on the phone is a bit crap with FF and REW being particularly useless. For the car, I got a standard ""taxi-driver"" phone holder and an adapter to connect the phone to a normal set of head-phones or line-out. This is then connected to a [VRFM8 FM transmitter thingy](http://cgi.ebay.com/USB-MP3-WMA-DvD-Cd-Player-Car-Stereo-FM-transmitter-8_W0QQitemZ5866888120QQcategoryZ3281QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem) which takes the sound and broadcasts it illegally to my radio and I listen via the radio. Sound quality on those FM transmitters is pretty rubbish and they really don't work for music, but for podcasts they are fine.

At Christmas, I asked my very kind father if I could borrow the Palm Tungsten T that he had never used and he said sure. I thought it only took SD cards but for the laugh I stuck the MMC card from the Nokia into it and the beauty worked. I then grabbed Real Player for Palm and loaded it up. This is a very nice piece of music playing software which integrates very smoothly with Real Player on the Desktop. I can now just drop MP3's from my desktop onto Real Player and it transfers them (at quite high speed) to the MMC in the Palm. The Tungsten T has a headphone socket, so I just connect that to the FM transmitter and I'm in business. The main advantages over the Nokia are the speed of music transfer, the far superior music player and the big buttons for controlling it whilst driving. The other advantage is that the card slot is open at the top of the Palm so I can easily swap cards if I have more stuff on another one.

Of course, we can't forget the other advantages of the Tungsten T: [ZX Spectrum Emulator](http://www.palmgear.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=software.showsoftware&prodid=47714), [tons of great games](http://www.palmgear.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=software.category&catid=73&PartnerREF=&siteid=1), currency convertor, web-browser which works using bluetooth to the phone, [eWallet](http://www.iliumsoft.com/), [Avantgo](http://www.avantgo.com/), [Vindigo](http://www.vindigo.com/). Whilst it is a little long in the tooth and under-powered compared to current models, I think it is a far more impressive piece of industrial design. Most current PDAs just look cheap, nasty and flimsy. The only thing it is really missing is wi-fi.

That is the tech sorted. What the hell is podcasting and which ones do I listen to? For non-techies, the explanation is really simple. Podcasts are recordings made by anyone from a guy in a shed talking about potting compost to a journalist with Business Week talking about Google to a normal radio show. Those recording are saved onto computer in a format called MP3 (just a sound compression system so the files don't take up too much space) and they then upload those files onto web-servers and let people know by various means that they can download them. If you want to listen to a podcast, you can grab the file off the web-site, save it on your computer and listen to it there (Windows comes with a sound player for them) or copy it to an MP3 player like an iPod and listen to it whilst walking or cycling. Nothing to it really.

The variation in quality of content and sound in podcasts is very interesting. The pro ones are often less impressive in what they are saying than the guy with the cheap handheld recorder. Here is a selection of ones I have checked out -

[Gastrocast](http://www.podchef.motime.com/): Neal the Podchef is based on an island off Washington state. He is very informed and has a wide range of food interests which are similar to my own. He spent time in Ireland and has been to Ballymaloe so Darina gets a mention. He often does bits on Irish food products like cheese. He has a very distinctive voice which is highly enunciated and this is exactly what is needed in a podcast. I can actually hear him whilst cycling unlike a lot of people (like Om Malik for example) who mumble into their chests and are often indecipherable. There are only two small negatives to my mind. The first is that an hour per episode is heading towards too long. My attention span isn't that long :-( Also, I have found that podcasts work best when there is more than one person involved. The interaction makes it more interesting. But considering where Neal lives, I don't think that is solvable. <strike>The other approach (as taken by Men In Aprons) is far far worse where the main talker shouts to his wife in the background and she shouts back</strike>.

[The Restaurant Guys](http://www.restaurantguysradio.com/sle/rg/): Informed, professional, funny. It is just a recording of their daily food show on a New Jersey Radio station. Francis and Mark together own two big restaurants in New Brunswick and each day they usually cover one main topic in great depth and with tons of humour and have an interview with someone. [Check out the episode where they discuss the bison cull in Montana](http://www.restaurantguysradio.com/sle/rg/content/shows/index.asp?show_id=108) and what sort of loser you'd have to be to mount the head of one of those animals. The bison are so used to human contact they think their photo is about to be taken! I listen to every episode these guys make.

[The Remarkable Palate](http://remarkablepalate.blogspot.com/): Mark Tafoya is a personal chef in New York. He covers lots of local NY things but also does recipes and lots of interviews. I just like his attitude to food in general. He should lose the recent music interludes tho.

[Eat Feed](http://www.eatfeed.com/): Anne Bramley seems extremely knowledgeable and interviews a wide range of people in the food business. But it just doesn't work for me. Her focus is on things I just do not find interesting (like baking) and I find a lot of the interviewees just plain annoying. I'm sure that it would be interesting to lots of people, just not to me. Actually, I did find her recent podcast on food interests and personality types to be worth a listen.

[On Food with Hsiao-Ching Chou](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/podcast/onfood.asp): Food Editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer newspaper. Very professionaly produced. Good meaty interviews mainly with chefs. Well worth a listen.

<strike>[Men in Aprons](http://www.meninaprons.net/): Seems to be recorded in a toilet by a husband and wife. The first episode I tried to listen to had recipes for your cat. I've tried several episodes since and I never last past their incessant giggling which usually starts after less than a minute.</strike>

[Girl on Girl Cooking](http://girlongirlcooking.blogspot.com/): Or as they should be known ""Cooking by the hard of thinking"". Car crash podcasting. Their episode on genetically modified foods was one of the funniest things I have ever heard and they were being deadly serious. ""They kinda like, ye know, f**k with the molecules of the food"".[

<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.pacificpalate.com/"">  ](http://www.pacificpalate.com/)[All You Can Eat](http://www.pacificpalate.com/): Don Genova is based in Vancouver and mainly does walkabout interviews with local people. Very down to earth and relaxed. Worth a listen. [

<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bbqblog.com/podcasts/"">  ](http://www.bbqblog.com/podcasts/)[BBQ Forum](http://www.bbqblog.com/podcasts/): If you are interested in BBQ or you're trying to learn about it (as I am), this is a must-listen. Ray Basso runs the biggest BBQ forum site on the web and is deeply knowledgeable. The guys he interviews (and in the world of BBQ it seems to be mainly guys) range from the very funny to the very strange, but all of them know what they are talking about. Very enjoyable.

And for a few non-foodie ones, you should try:

[Tom Raftery's Podleaders](http://www.podleaders.com/): Great interviews with tech visionaries by a Cork-based IT person

[Ricky Gervais](http://www.guardian.co.uk/rickygervais): Awesome. Snot out the nose funny. Karl Pilkington for King! Nearly finished so hurry and grab em.

[Diggnation](http://revision3.com/diggnation): Should be annoying; Two young guys talking tech in valley speak. Actually hilarious and very interesting.

Foodtalk on Newstalk,"I just got a mail from the lovely people in [The Good Things Cafe](http://www.thegoodthingscafe.com/) in Durrus to tell me that the awesome Carmel was on the [Foodtalk](http://newstalk.ie/newstalk/programmes/37/foodtalk.html) programme on [Newstalk Radio](http://newstalk.ie/).

![](http://www.thegoodthingscafe.com/img/gtc_outside.jpg ""Good Things"")

Foodtalk is hosted by one of the best food bloggers anywhere, Caroline Hennessy from [Bibliocook](http://www.bibliocook.com/).

If you want to listen online and subscribe so that you get each broadcast, then there are a bunch of different ways of doing it.

On your PC, one of the best tools is [MediaMonkey](http://www.mediamonkey.com/). Install it, tell it [about Foodtalk](http://newstalk.ie/newstalk/podcasts.html), leave it running in the background and it'll automatically download the new episodes so you can listen at your desk.

If you have a newer car stereo or (like us) one of the replacement Lidl/Aldi ones, then you can copy those audio files onto a memory card or USB stick and play them in the car when you like.

Lots of the newer phones with Wifi also have podcasting capabilities. The Nokia N95, N95-8GB, N96 etc come with the software built in. Owners of the E51, E63, E71 etc can [download it from here](http://europe.nokia.com/A41107006). You have to manually tell the application to check for new episodes but it takes care of the download etc once you do that. You can listen directly on the phone or plug it into the line-in on your stereo or car-stereo.

If you have an iPod, I'm sure it's all very similar.

Note that most of the radio stations, in particular [RTE](http://www.rte.ie/radio/podcast/), have a ton of podcasts you can get like this. I recently listened to all of a year-old series about De Valera I grabbed from the RTE site on my N95-8GB."
For everything else,"As I've never understood American football, I obviously don't watch the Superbowl. But this means I only just found out about the Mastercard ad that was on during it. I'm sure Patty and Selma would have swooned through the whole thing.

"Forde's of Wexford, Top 100? Not even close","We had our week down in Rosslare. I'd call it a holiday but there were 8 kids in the house. My lovely sisters and parents gave us the night off on Wednesday so we had to pick where to eat. Catherine wasn't in the mood for Italian so it was no to Dolce Vita. Heaven's Above sounded good. Dunbrody House was too far. Lobster Pot doesn't take bookings in the summer. A few reviews later and we settled on Forde's. But we left the house with my Ma warning us that they had an awful meal there a while back.

Service wasn't unfriendly but not exactly effusive. Focus was obviously on fish but the meat mains were a bit odd with multiple variations of steak. Catherine got prawn spring rolls to start. Rolls themselves were fine but the ""salsa"" was brutal. Crunchy veg and overwhelming taste of courgette. Salad was mediocre.
I had Duck Leg Confit. The duck was fine but again the saucing was pretty cack-handed. All I could really taste was pepper.

For main, Catherine had sole fillet. They did them as little roll-mops which unfortunately meant they were over-cooked on the outside and ""rare"" in the middle. Nasty and pretty tasteless. Came with a basil sauce. Now I adore basil but I'm not sure what it was doing in a sole sauce. I went for brill which was fine if a little bland.

The highlight had to be potato in a spring roll casing. What? I was only disapponted that it didn't have chips right in the middle with maybe a rice coating and spaghetti tails.

Desserts were parfait for Catherine and semi-fredo for me. What came out were two things of identical frozen texture. My semi was really just fredo. I could bitch about espresso coming in cappucino cups but that would be just mean.

So John McKenna thinks this is one of the top 100 restaurants in Ireland? Doesn't surprise me - the Bridgestone guide is good for addresses and telephone numbers only. I have read reviews in there which don't actually mention food at any point.

Of course Tom Doorley recently listed it as a must-visit in Wexford in the Sunday Tribune. I used to think Tom was one of those very bright people who feign bumbling cluelessness a bit like Boris Johnson. But the more I watch ""The Restaurant"", the more I realise that it isn't an act. This is a guy who reviews wine on afternoon TV but who doesn't seem to have correctly identified one grape variety in this entire series. His laughable attempts to guess origin and price are reason enough to watch the programme. So I don't think I'll be taking restaurant advice from him either.

So a meal for two with two drinks and a cheap bottle of wine in Wexford. How much? &euro;126! They really are relying on never-come-again tourists aren't they? These guys are charging Tannery level prices for Coopers level food. A fine business head running the show there. Avoid."

[I completely slated Forde's](http://conoroneill.com/2005/08/07/fordes-of-wexford-top-100-not-even-close/) last year after the utterly mediocre overpriced meal we had there. It was on my permanent blacklist until today. My parents stepped once more into the breech and babysat the recovering nutters so that myself and Catherine could go out for a bite. 

I had done a search on Georgina Campbell's site and came up with a shortlist of The Lobster Pot in Carne, Le Colosseo in Rosslare, La Dolce Vida in Wexford, La Riva in Wexford, Mange 2 in Wexford and
Forde's. The Lobster Pot has a reputation for horribly arrogant service and overpriced food (and you can't book) so that was a no-no. We weren't in a real Italian mood so that just left Mange 2 and Forde's. It looked like Mange 2 would be the winner but then I was told about the poaching of the Heaven's Above chef by Forde's. The consistent bad stories we had all heard about them last year (by real diners as opposed to professional critics) had been replaced by very positive
ones since the new chef's arrival. So Forde's it was.

And oh jesus what a mistake that was. 

Without a doubt the worst service I have had in a restaurant in five years. From the second we sat down, the clear aim was to get us the hell out of there. And well done to them, they beat our record. Three courses plus coffee in less than an hour and it was all completely mediocre except the coffee.

I don't know what sort of crack John McKenna, Tom Doorley and Georgina Campbell are smoking but they are so far off the mark on this place, it isn't funny.

The waiting staff never smiled once. They sat us beside the toilets in an almost empty restaurant. The bread came out with rock hard butter (Cert Training Day 1??). When we ordered the house tempranillo, the waitress said ""great choice"" and threw her eyes up to heaven as she walked off. The tone of ""are you enjoying your meal"" was such that you knew full well they did not give a shite either way. When we ordered our dessert, the waitress left so fast we had to shout our coffee order at her.

As for the food, no improvement on last year. Do they really have the old chef from Heaven's above? The same stupid spud in a spring roll was on the menu - the restaurant equivalent of a chip butty. The same five beef dishes (four types of steak) out of a meat menu of eight. In fact, has the menu changed one iota from last year? The concept of ""fish of the day"" seems to escape them as all the fish is listed in the permanent menu. I must send them a map to Kilmore Quay.

Anyway, Catherine's prawn salad on a bed of chinese leaves was missing its bed entirely. My confit of duck leg came with burnt rosti and was swimming in a pool of sauce. My brill was totally overcooked and Catherine's lamb tasted ok but was very fatty and overcooked. Did they really cook a saddle of lamb in the time we were there or was it zapped? My pannacotta had the texture of butter rather than cream but Catherine's desert was ok. Coffee was fine.

I've just re-read my review from last year to realise that I ordered exactly the same food this year as last! I know that shows me to be utterly predictable but it also says a lot about their static menu. Going by my comments last year, it really does look like the place has amazingly managed to get worse in twelve months.

How the hell are these people getting awards? Seriously, there is something utterly broken in mainstream restaurant reviewing that we can encounter service and food like this TWICE from a place with a 2006 Bridgestone plaque on the wall. To give Forde's their due, I don't think I have giggled that much since I was a teenager - a highly enjoyable night out with my wife.

For what I think is the second time ever in a restaurant, I left zero tip.

From Liverpool to Manchester - Conor does his 50 (miles) before 50 (years),"Last March I decided I wanted to run a 50 mile race before I hit the big five oh in May of this year. On Monday, in spite of freezing rain, hail, sleet and snow, I somehow managed it and I can't stop randomly grinning.

As always, have no fear, this won't be a mile-by-mile race report. I'd fall asleep writing it :-) Speaking of which, one of my ultra-running top tips is ""Don't listen to the audiobook of 'Why We Sleep' on miles 30-40 of a 50 miler if you want to avoid getting verrrrry verrrry sleepy."" (The same also applies to the audio book of Niall Ferguson's 'The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook').

I know 50 miles is way outside of the experience of most people. But trust me when I say that most of you reading this could have done it. A solid level of fitness, a bit of stubborness and experience of lots of time on your feet is really all you need. Remember I'm 60lbs overweight and I finished. I'll mention the weight thing again shortly.

## Training. Or as I like to call it, not training.
Training for L2M50 was a disaster. I ignored every bit of advice in books and immediately went from 22ish miles per week to 37 miles per week in January. Very quickly both achilles were in pain and both knees were complaining. Despite trying everything, the right achilles was still hurting all the way up to race day. I'd end up dong a long run on a Sunday and then taking days off for the achilles to calm down. My tapering consisted of not running at all for the last two weeks, hoping to give it a rest. Stoopid.

My wife had a better time with training and was far more diligent. She spotted MCI back-to-back marathons in Limerick in March which would have been an ideal check of how we'd handle 50 miles. In the end it was cancelled with the snow. Instead we did the EOI Lusk Marathon followed by the MCI Salthill one. All the signs were good (apart from that Salomon Sense Pro Max disaster in Salthill).

## How to avoid being head wrecked for 50 miles
Look, my marathon times are a disaster. I'm slowly getting faster but I'm still crazy slow. However that turns out to be a big help when getting your head sorted for a 50 miler. I'm used to spending many (many many) hours on my feet moving slowly and never DNFing marathons.

It's possibly a placebo, but I get great value from [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/). There have been many marathons where I've channelled Andy's calm dulcet tones and got myself out of serious negativity.

The other huge help on Monday was actually The Barkley Marathons on the previous weekend. Seeing and reading about the hell everyone went through this year gave me a sense of perspective ""It's only a flat 50 miles Conor. And your collar-bone isn't broken like Eoin Keith's was.""

## Liverpule
How the hell have I got to 49 years old and never visited Liverpool before? The regenerated docks area is fabulous and everyone was just lovely. The hotel and start line were at Albert Dock and we registered just beside them on Sunday night in the cold.

Whilst queuing for kit-check and photo, I overheard the best advice a nervous ultra virgin could hear - ""don't think of it as a 50 mile race. Think of it as an 8 mile race followed by lots of food. Then a 6 mile race followed by lots of food. And so on"". It really worked. That's exactly how I broke the day down and it kept me sane throughout.

## Torrential Scouse rain
This caused me more stress in the week coming up to the race than anything else. Initially heavy snow was predicted. Then lots and lots of rain. Andddd low-temps going sub-zero with wind chill. It got to the point where I packed trekking poles and my trail runners, I was that worried. But the worry ended up working to my benefit as I'd packed every possible thing.

We looked out the hotel room window at 4.45am to see very heavy rain. I decided to wear thick gloves, full length running tights and a buff, in addition to a base layer, running top and waterproof jacket. We walked out the door and were hit with bitterly cold wind to go with the stinging rain.

237 poor souls headed off in the rain, wind and dark along the Mersey at 6am. I was sure we were running faster than my marathon pace which really bothered me. It turned out we weren't even close to that, it was the conditions, along with two dead legs in my case, that made it feel so hard.

The first 8 miles were in the streets of Liverpool. I spotted Penny Lane at one stage (not really a lane if you ever visit). The rain turned to hail, then sleet and then snow. Stress levels rose. The first checkpoint was where is switched to more country paths etc. From then on it was a mix of paths, suburbia such as Warrington and gritted trails.

## I cannae feel ma leg
That's ma leg ya bumpot (for [fans of Billy Connolly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZj0AkZUpDo)).

Whilst we were both really feeling the cold, my wife was suffering a lot worse. She didn't bring gloves and she was wearing a running skirt. Our pace was mis-matched which caused her to stop and wait for me and then cool down excessively. She wouldn't take up my offer of my soaking wet heavy gloves and we didn't have the brilliant inspiration of Charlie Sharpe's crisp packets. Eventually it all got too much and she DNFed around mile 20. I was heartbroken for her and then had a few miles of self-pity as I'd pictured us finishing together for months.

I think the two things that saved me were the gloves and the fact that I'm obese. I know it sounds nuts but fat people stay warmer in the cold than thin people. As [this article says](https://www.popsci.com/article/science/fyi-do-fat-people-stay-warmer-thin-people) (semi-jokingly), the best thing to be in the cold is fat and fit. Bingo!

## They're not puddles, they're lakes
I generally enjoy running off-road in [manky](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Manky) conditions but that's always in trail shoes and usually for not more than 13 miles. The relentless rain wasn't just hard on me, it destroyed the paths we were running on.

My semi-slick Hoka Clifton's had landed me flat on my back a few weeks previously on some wet grass so I was ridiculously careful trying to tip-toe around every bit of flooding. But it was exhausting and made it impossible to keep a running pace. Eventually around mile 40 I said fuck it and ploughed straight through the water from then on. My feet were like blocks of ice.

## Conor invents a new treatment for achilles tendinopathy
As I said, I've had right achilles pain since January. Guess what I haven't had since last Monday? Achilles pain! So if you too have tendinopathy, then I highly recommend doing 50 miles in freezing rain with your feet soaked through and your achilles submerged for many miles.

## Spuds and instant coffee never tasted so good
As the miles built up, the food at the checkpoints just got better and better. I stuffed whole baby potatoes, crisps, sausage rolls, pretzels and sweets into my gob. But the highlights were the coffee, tea and hot chocolate at three different stops. I think they may have kept me just warm enough to keep going.

## I'm just going to stand in a field for 14 hours
I don't know how the volunteers did it. I'll forever be in awe of them and in their debt for getting me around. The food, the smiles, the words of encouragement, the assistance to people who were struggling, it was all amazing. Thank you thank you thank you. And to everyone (including the husband of another runner) who took care of my wife and got her to Didsbury, we will never forget your kindness.

## Oooh a nukular power station
As anyone who [follows me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2843314) knows, my training runs are less about running and more about a photo tour of local forests and hills. I took the sum total of 2 photos during the race. One of a nice bridge (no idea where) and another of what I thought was a nuclear power station. I had many classic Simpsons scenes in my head. I was gutted to discover afterwards that it was a boring coal-fired one.

## Looks like I'm gonna do this thing
Getting to 25 miles had me in great mood. I was half way. But getting to 28 had me at a real low point. Oh my god there's 22 miles left. Everything hurt. In fact, so many things hurt that it kinda helped. I couldn't focus on the pain in my ITB, when I also had pains in both feet, my lower back, my wrist (WTF?), my other knee, my calves, my quads and my core.

But when I got to mile 37, I knew, barring a catastrophe, that I was going to finish. I ""only"" had a half marathon left to do. The final CP was at mile 44. I stuffed my face again, refilled the water bottles, added the Tailwind and staggered off into the dusk.

## Where's the bleedin' ferry across the Mersey when I need it?
The markings all day had been great as long as you kept your wits about you. I had to shout to only two people that I saw going astray. But with 4 miles to go, my brain was fudge. I mindlessly followed some people in front of me and after maybe half a mile we realised we had gone wrong. I'd followed them and they'd followed someone else, who had disappeared.

I had the [Viewranger](http://www.viewranger.com/en-US) app on my phone along with the route pre-loaded. A quick check proved that we were on the wrong side of the Mersey. The only way to fix it was to re-trace our steps. Arghghghghghghghghghgh. Would you believe I actually packed a compass? Again I had L2M50 confused with the Barkley Marathons. I found the turn we'd missed and started walking as fast as I could along the river in a complete mudfest of a track.

## Sorry mate, I'm not from around here
The trail on the river seemed endless. I kept checking Viewranger to confirm I hadn't overshot as there were no course markings along there. Finally I saw the footbridge into Didsbury. I marched up to the junction and saw a course marking. But I couldn't figure out whether to go left or right as I missed the blindingly obvious arrow on the same pole. I tried asking two people going into a pub for directions but I nearly broke down in front of them. They had no idea where the club was. This turned out to be a stroke of luck as the finish line was at the rugby club not the football club.

## I would walk 500 miles and I feel like I have
What followed was the longest mile of my life. Longer than my first marathon where both calves seized solid. Longer than Brighton 2017 where the heat got to me and I started singing out loud as I ran. Longer than my first 10k where I thought I was going to die. Yeah that long.

Oh wait, here's the sports club. Nooooooo, it's the golf club. Ah here we are. Nooooooo, it's the cricket club. Finally, the road is coming to an end. I must be here. What? Another bridge? FFS are you effing kidding me (last one shouted out loud).

And then......is that......Catherine?????? OMFG, it is, I'm here. Surely they'll take pity on me now and not force me to do a loop of the pitch.

No chance.

## Cue Chariots of Fire music. Or maybe Peppa Pig
I slowly stagger around the mudbath of a pitch. Smiling from ear to ear. But then I turn the first corner and who do I spy coming on to the pitch? The 3 people from earlier. Jogging. I'm not a physically competitive person (clearly) but sometimes, when I'm approaching that finish line, something in my brain kicks in.

Fukkit, time to drop the hammer Conor. I start running. In my mind I'm Usain Bolt. In reality I'm a fat old dude sliding around in mud at 0.00005 MPH. Can I get to the finish line without landing on my face? Maybe. The cheering starts. I hang on. One last jump to land on the rubber mat. I did it.

![Finish line](/images/2018/04/finish_l2m50.jpg)

## 14:02:00
2 hrs and 2 minutes over the cutoff for a loop of Barkleys :-) I know it's a ridiculous time to do 50 flat miles. I don't care. I had one job to do on Monday - finish. I did that job. I'm a very very happy man.

My Garmin died around mile 46. I'm pretty sure I did something more like 52 miles. And despite all the pains and my inability to run any faster than I walked at the end, I think I could have done another 5-10 miles if I'd really had to.

![Medal](/images/2018/04/medal_l2m50.jpg)

## The post-race low
It's a week later. I did 2.5 miles on the treadmill today and I'm mostly ok. Tight hip, slight ITB glitches but otherwise fine.

We're both in that horrible post-race ""depression"" where you've thought about little else for months and now there's nothing. It's worse for Catherine as she missed out on finishing.

Whilst of course we'll do the 25K [Great Railway Run](http://www.thegreatrailwayrun.com/grrHome.php) and [The Surf Turf and Tar](https://surfturfntar.com/) Half, plus a couple of marathons in the next month or two, we need something longer. If you know of any 50k to 50 mile non-technical non-bog non-crazy-vert Ultras coming up soonish in Ireland/UK/Europe, let me know. I'll be trawling the usual sites.

## What's next?
Usual plan. Lose a ton of weight. Get a lot faster. Over every distance.

Based on Monday, I think I have a 100k in me right now but of course I don't have anything like 100 miles in me yet. I want to look at doing a European mountain ultra.

## Final words
If you're thinking about doing an Ultra, have a look at all the events that the [GB Ultras](http://www.gbultras.com/) team organises. They really do an amazing job and [their communities](https://www.facebook.com/groups/357383037943147/) on the dreaded Facebook are extremely friendly and welcoming to ultra virgins. Go on, give it a go.

Oh course, a week later and I'm already planning my next big run :-)

## Update 1 - April 10th 2018 - Gear
I'm sure everyone is dying to know what gear the 6th slowest runner in #L2M50 used :-) Well I'm going to tell you anyway. Starting from my toes: X-Socks trail socks, Hoka One One Clifton 3 running shoes, Ron Hill running tights, Runderwear briefs, Lidl long-sleeve compression top, Berlin Marathon finisher top, Ron Hill Infinity Torrent jacket, Buff, Rab Latok cap with flaps, Salomon Adv 5 Skin hydration vest and softflasks, Helly Hansen spare base layer (unused, stupidly), Tailwind nutrition, Rowntrees sour pastilles, 4 megatons of GU & Torq gels (unused), 2XU heavy cycling gloves (useless), Jaybird X3 Bluetooth headphones, Samsung Galaxy S8+ (waterproof), Eotw generic phone armband (pretty useless), Garmin Fenix 3 watch (disappointed it didn't last).

## Update 2 - April 11th 2018 - Why
I read two things about Ultra running recently that really annoyed me. I should have avoided them and I'm not going to link to them. The first was the comments section in Adharanand Finn's article on the rise of ultrarunning. The second was a Let's Run thread on the same topic. In both, the level of spite and vituperation towards people who do ultra distances was gob-smacking. You'd swear we were murderers based on the bizarre anger expressed.

I read an interview with Spine Race winner Carol Morgan (which I can't currently find) where she just described it as her hobby. And that's it. No different to gardening, knitting, watching other people kick a ball, cycling or home-brewing.

Is running long distances purely a middle-class thing? Not based on the very wide selection of people I've met. Is it for nut-jobs only? I've yet to meet anyone I'd describe as weird at running events, compared say to the behaviour of some ball-sports fanatics at any match. Should we all be using the time we spend running helping lepers in Africa instead? Yes maybe you should Mr Commenter.

It's just a hobby. I'm sure there are assholes who act like doing 50 miles makes them a master of the universe. Again I've never met anyone like that at any running event. In fact, the winner of #L2M50, who did it in less than half the time I did, comes across as an incredibly kind, funny and low-key person. Who happens to be good at running and clearly works hard at it.

So there is no specific ""why"" to doing 50 miles or more really. 26.2 is a completely arbitrary distance. As it 10K or 100K.

I've re-discovered the outdoors via running. It helps with clearing the head. It hopefully keeps me out of an early grave, if I can sort out this weight. It lets me visit cool places and leave no trace. Recently it's the main way I manage to carve out time to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. It disconnects me from the constant noise of the internet. And it's interesting to see what longer and longer distances do to the mind and body.

Oh yeah, a lot of the time, it's good fun. Like any hobby."
"From NYC to Kerry, a wrap-up of my races over the past year","![Shoes](/images/2018/09/20180821_121150.jpg)

Apart from a couple like the Liverpool to Manchester 50 miler, I haven't been keeping up on my mini race reports over the past year. Hopefully you'll find them useful if you're planning for next year. I'll keep them short and sweet.

## New York City Marathon

I'm not sure whey I never did a full race report on this because it was an incredible experience. It overtook London as the marathon that emotionally impacted me the most. I could not stop saying to myself ""I'm in the NYC marathon. Me"". The support on the streets was mind-blowing. The fact that I had a ridiculously slow day, even for me, doesn't bother me at all. Oh and suddenly realising the crazy Paddy shouting ""Up Ireland"" was actually old workmate Cian, was a total highlight of the day and gave me a huge boost in the final 2 miles. And Shalane won, which made the whole thing perfect. [Fuck yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo63CWP0YgE).

## Clonakilty Half Marathon

We do it every year. It's never easy. This year had the added twist of the jetlag of a 14 hour flight from Austin and a hangover. So of course I PBed :-)

## EOI Lusk Marathon

This was one of the practice runs for L2M50. A small-scale local looped marathon. Really enjoyable. If you like a low key race with very friendly people, this is ideal. They have a whole series of them around the East Coast.

## MCI Salthill Marathon

Another training run for L2M50. Lashed rain all day. Had that problem with the Salomons. But actually really enjoyed it. Salthill and Galway lovely as always. The curry afterwards was even better.

## Liverpool to Manchester 50 Miler

[Full race report here](https://conoroneill.com/2018/04/08/from-liverpool-to-manchester-conor-does-50-before-50/). Starting to think about 100K races in 2019.

## Great Railway Run

This was our second year to do it. I somehow found myself coming last after just a couple of miles with the damned ambulance revving behind me. Where the hell were all the walkers and C25Kers? Anyway, managed to get past a few people and lose the ambulance. This is a gorgeous route and highly recommended.

## Sportyfeel Helsinki City Marathon

I'd only been in Finland once before for work and saw nothing. Which is a real pity as Helsinki is gorgeous. The marathon was two loops and verrrry relaxed and low key. No big crowds and a constantly changing landscape from downtown to forest tracks. I had a really bad day with stomach issues, overheating and general tiredness but got around as always. I think the race would suit a lot of people. Check it out. We loved the bus tour the following day too.

## Ballyheigue Half On The Head

Second year to do this. Worth it for the views alone. Very hilly but I had a great day and powered up them all. This may become a regular fixture for us as you can easily get there from Cork on the morning of the race.

## Brandon Bay Half

Another part of Kerry I'd never been to, this is a lovely area and that's one amazing long beach. But it was a horrible horrible day for a run. Howling wind in my face for 6.5 miles on mostly well packed sand, but with plenty of wet bits too. Then turn around and get pushed along by the same wind. All the while being able to see the entire course. I doubt I'll be doing this again.

## Run Killarney Half Marathon

Most fun you can have with your clothes on in Killarney. This is a total blast. Basically downhill the whole way from Moll's Gap (but with plenty of undulations). Just go hell for leather until you run out of steam - in my case just before we entered the National Park. I PBed everything from 5K to Half Marathon on the day. Loved it. Just go do it.

## East Cork Harbour 10K

We really didn't like the marathon here last year. The first section was fabulous but the rest was either the main road or faceless country roads. The 10K on the other hand is a little gem. Run from Rostellan towards Whitegate and back again. Another balls to the wall, run until you want to puke course. Loved it and got a huge boost seeing Catherina McKiernan absolutely crushing it and coming 3rd **overall**.

## Kerry Ultra 50K

[Full race report here](https://conoroneill.com/2018/09/02/the-kerry-ultra-50k-go-on-sign-up-for-2019/).

## What's left in 2018?

Chicago!

Plus a few more halves and maybe a couple of IMRA races.

My solo ""runs"" on Slí Gaeltacht Mhúscraí, Lackabaun, Coumshingaun, Carrauntoohil and Lough Curra this summer highlighted how much work I have to do to get any sort of acceptable mountain running pace. So I want to focus a lot on that for 2019."
Frost Stops Play,"Whilst growing up from age 6-18 in Kilkenny, one group of people I never got on with were the park-keepers (""parkies"") in the Castle Park. They always seemed to be fun-killers.

It looks like nothing has changed in over 20 years. I watched at least 50 people walk away gutted from the park yesterday with bawling children due to this:

![Frost Stops Play](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/27122008256-300x225.jpg ""Frost Stops Play"")

One person claimed it was because a child had slipped and hurt themselves on the previous day. A child. Hurt. In a playground. Shock! Horror! How could this happen? Quick! Sue someone! 

We just went and climbed some 100 ft tall trees and let the children fall into the unfenced pond instead since that was much safer.

And don't get me started on the ""We close at 4pm but actually lock all but one of the gates at 3.30pm so we can be in the pub at 4.01pm"".

Office of Public _Works_ eh?"
Fun Food in Arthurstown,"A brilliant gift of a cookery course in Dunbrody by my fabulous sister-in-law Paula led to one of the best day's out I've had in ages.  Interesting and enjoyable in every way without a dull moment in a gorgeous location.

We did our annual extended family meet-up on the August Bank Holiday weekend in Rosslare recently. On Friday morning I borrowed my mother's car and drove the 45 minute journey to Arthurstown near the ferry in Ballyhack.

[![01082008256](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3070/2752376585_122ab01dc7.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2752376585/ ""01082008256 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

For some silly reason I thought Dunbrody was just a cookery school and restaurant but soon discovered it is a hotel and spa too. I arrived on the dot of 9.30 to find just two other people there; a BandB owner and a GP, both of whom were very friendly. A moment later, Edward, our teacher, swooped in to start our day of ""Light Lunches"". I have to say that the guy was just wonderful for the whole session. Tons of energy, knowledge and anecdotes. He's just finished a cookery book which will be launched soon. Keep an eye out for it: ""Entertaining with Edward"". I wish I had been that accomplished at the age of 26!

[![01082008265](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3100/2752380947_66c8c54400.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2752380947/ ""01082008265 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

My only tiny disappointment on the day was realising that it was all demos with no hands on. This is inevitable given the size and layout of the room but I do love to get stuck in. My concern that I might get bored just watching proved totally unfounded. Edward's manner and approach made sure we didn't even suffer the mid-afternoon lull.

[![01082008232](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3166/2752364157_69c0f20cfd.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2752364157/ ""01082008232 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

The list of things he made was extensive and there wasn't a clunker among them. I would just love to be able to multi-task the way that he did. He did the following:

**Traditional Brown Soda Bread:** This was lovely and nutty. Not as good as my mothers but still great.
[![01082008236](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2752365329_c517e12287.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2752365329/ ""01082008236 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

**Fresh Basil Pesto**: For some reason I have never made pesto. This was one of the best I've had.
[![01082008230](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3075/2753197414_cba1f04bdb.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2753197414/ ""01082008230 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

**Crab Croquettes with Sweet Chilli Jam**: Whilst I'll definitely be making the croquettes again, the jam just made me feel stupid. I cannot believe how easy it is to make and how much better it was than any bought jar. This is going to be one of my regular creations from now on.
[![01082008229](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3078/2753197044_0a631891db.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2753197044/ ""01082008229 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

**Smoked Haddock and Rocket Tart**: One of the absolute highlights of the day. If you love fish pie, this makes a quicker and lighter alternative
[![01082008258](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3100/2752377309_0927e7c3e1.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2752377309/ ""01082008258 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

**Cheese and Bacon Quesadillas**: Simple and tasty as hell. Will be trying this on the kids. Total winner.
[![01082008235](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/2753199112_d585920fa1.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2753199112/ ""01082008235 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

**Fish en paupilotte**: This genuinely shocked me. I love smoked salmon, I detest cooked fresh salmon, it makes me gag. Yet somehow, this tasted beautiful and I scoffed the lot. Another ultra-easy meal which will be a future regular.
[![01082008238](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3074/2752365969_6d2f839976.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2752365969/ ""01082008238 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

**Mild Cajun Chicken**: Lovely and juicy in a yoghurt coating
**Classic Italian Meatballs**: Excellent but not a patch on my own :-) The mince mix would make fantastic burgers or meatloaf.
**Vegetarian Roulade with Spinach**: The least favourite for the three of us but still good. Some of the intended ingredients were not delivered on the day which is a pity as I can imagine how much better it would have been.
[![01082008266](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3189/2753215368_4393a02ffd.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2753215368/ ""01082008266 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

**Mediterranean Pasta Salad**: Using roasted veg and some of the pesto, this is perfect BBQ food.
**Meringue Roulade with Summer Berries and Toasted Almonds**: Should be illegal. We had it for our elevenses and it was light as a feather and totally delish.
[![01082008234](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3284/2753198712_329d00b9bd.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2753198712/ ""01082008234 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

Edward also gave us two tours of the kitchen gardens which were a joy to see. Jammed with every sort of veg, fruit and herb. If only I had the acerage and the time!

[![01082008243](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/2753203008_b729347d7e.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2753203008/ ""01082008243 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

I was chuffed to get a branded apron and Kevin Dundon's latest book as I left. This course won't teach you amazing new techniques if you are already a solid home chef but it will give you tons of ideas for tasty interesting family meals. It's also a perfect day of relaxation and fun.

[Full set of photos](http://flickr.com/photos/bandon1/sets/72157606664183686/) from the day including [geo-tagged ones](http://flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2752380947/map/?view=everyones) on Flickr."
Funniest Damn thing I've read in a long time,"From the Onion: [Irish-Heritage Timeline](http://theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4111&n=12)

Sample: ""1487 - In a decision still regretted today, Irish let a few British friends stay in Belfast"".

This must have been written by a Paddy. Makes me proud to be Irish. 

Unfortunately, as I spent 8 years in the Scouts as a kid and had to march in the pissing rain every March 17th in the Paddy's Day Parade in Kilkenny, I now have a pathological loathing of the whole day. Saluting a buch of no-name County Councillors who were happily sitting in the dry in an open-sided Smithwicks truck trailer has made me a bitter man. Snakes, schmakes."
"G'Day Commissioner Gordon, it's BitMin heah","![](http://static.flickr.com/38/80530566_b0f141f89d_m.jpg)

For one very scary moment, I thought we had accidentally rented out a special Australian Edition of ""Batman Begins"" redubbed with Sir Les Patterson as Batman, Dame Edna Everage as Rachel Dawes and Michael Caine as Alfred (oh, wait a sec).

Luckily we found Ireland somewhere around Latvia. This had Twink as Rachel Dawes...........

Technorati Tags: [batmanbegins](http://technorati.com/tag/batmanbegins)"
Geeky thought about an Irish-English/English-Irish dictionary,"Our start-up [LouderVoice](http://blog.loudervoice.com/) got a nice mention in the Irish-language daily newspaper [Lá](http://www.nuacht.com/). We were at an un-conference called BarCamp Ireland South-East in Waterford and [Conn Ó Muíneacháin](http://www.imeall.com/) did a nice write up about it. Due to my desperately rusty Irish, I had to make use of [this online dictionary](http://www.englishirishdictionary.com/dictionary) to translate some of the words. Whilst it is a great resource, it seems to be lacking a huge number of words and also only seems to handle the roots of of words (or whatever it is called i.e it'll find léirmheastóir but not léirmheastóireachta).

So the thought struck me this morning that a dictionary is the ideal target for a community effort, like Wikipedia is for encyclopedias. In fact, some sort of custom wiki might be ideal as a base for generating such a dictionary.

It could start very simply with one page per letter of the alphabet and as it grows, new pages are generated to sub-divide it. A wiki is very simply a web-site with pages that anyone can edit. The idea being that if you went to the wiki-dictionary to find the translation of a word and you spotted other ones that were missing, in a few simple clicks you could add them.

Of course it would need an agreed style of entry so it looked consistent but I'm sure there are plenty of language experts who could come up with a few simple rules for that. It would also need moderators to keep it clean and delete spam etc. And the search function would have to be very good.

For the laugh, I've just created a sample of what that might look like over at pbWiki. It took all of ten minutes to do and is called [focloir.pbwiki.com](http://focloir.pbwiki.com/).

Gender Confirmed by computer,"<div style=""clear: both"" />Just in case there was any doubt, [The Gender Genie](http://www.bookblog.net/gender/genie.html) confirmed that I'm a bloke. Huge sighs of relief from my wife. Interesting wee tool actually (The Gender Genie, not me). I just cut n paste some blog entries and it gave 247 male vs 146 female.

We're off to the Bandon Show in an hour or so. The last time I was at anything like this I must have been in my mid-teens and my parents took me on the annual pilgrimage to The Spring Show in the RDS. I used enjoy it so I hope I haven't over-hyped this one to the squirts.

In keeping with the Eurovision theme of this weekend, Mickey Joe Harte is headlining the entertainment. Oh sorry, he's Micky Harte now - yeah, that's far more suave and sophisticated sounding.

Oisín will be gutted when he finds out that there are in fact no elephants at agricultural shows. But he's right - there should be.

Get your Irish Blog Award Nominations in,"It's that time of year again to get your [nominations in](http://awards.ie/blogawards/nominations/) for the [Irish Blog Awards](http://awards.ie/blogawards/). The ceremony is being held in the lovely [Cork International Airport Hotel](http://www.corkinternationalairporthotel.com/) on February 21.

![irishblogawards1](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/irishblogawards1.jpg ""irishblogawards1"")

The number of wonderful Irish blogs increases daily and I can't keep up with the flood of high quality writing out there. There are plenty of categories to nominate in, but you don't have to do all of them. Why not head over to [Irishblogs.ie](http://www.irishblogs.ie/) and have a browse of the posts there? You may find some real gems you hadn't known about before.

I think this year I'll focus my nominations on the best of the newer blogs. For example, [Ivan1](http://messy-chef.com/blog/) and [Ivan2](http://foodculturewestcork.wordpress.com/) will be getting several votes from me."
Getting Free Digital TV in West Cork on Rabbit Ears,"Over [on my tech blog](http://conoroneill.net/our-replacement-for-sky-tv-cost-99-ariva-120) recently, I mentioned dumping Sky TV and getting an [Ariva 120 box](https://www.satellite.ie/acatalog/HD_Ariva_120_Combo_Box.html#aFerguson120Combo). This is a combination satellite and digital terrestrial receiver. It costs an amazing €99 and you never have to pay another thing. You disconnect your Sky box, plug the satellite lead and aerial lead into the Ariva and you're done.

Until yesterday I had only used the satellite bit which gives you BBC etc. It works very well except for the lack of a programme guide. I recorded Doctor Who onto a portable hard-disk using it yesterday! But I really wanted to try out the terrestrial bit. The other night we watched Masterchef Ireland using the RTE Player on a 37"" TV in a browser, full-screen. Not recommended if you value your eyesight or sanity. Sidenote: Dylan surprisingly non-infuriating but I had a big belly laugh when I heard a guy who serves steaks on paving slabs calling someone's food ""contrived"".

Our old roof aerial hasn't been working right for years and I wasn't sure where the problem was. So yesterday I cut the cable in the attic near the ingress hole and wired it straight into a old TV I hoisted into the attic. It confirmed that the aerial itself was banjaxed but there was no way I was doing a Rod Hull on it. I grabbed a pair of rabbit ears and then tried them to discover that I could get traditional analogue RTE1 and RTE2 reasonably ok with a bit of noise but not TG4 or TV3.

I wondered if that signal was enough to get the new [Saorview Digital Terrestrial](http://www.saorview.ie/) working on the Ariva box so I brought the box up into the attic and amazingly it worked instantly! Perfect digital picture on RTE1, RTE2, TV3, TG4 with full on-screen programme guide too. I had some interactions with people on Twitter last night who confirmed that even if your old analogue signal is poor, you may still be able to get Saorview.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/saorview-300x89.png ""saorview"")](http://www.saorview.ie/make-the-switch/coverage-checker/coverage-map/)

Unfortunately the rabbit ears don't have enough welly to feed a splitter box so today I'm popping into [Dwyers Electrical](http://www.dwyers.ie/store/product/381/Televes-DAT-HD-UHF/) to get this aerial and I'll fit it in the attic. This type of aerial may be necessary for a lot of people in West Cork due to all the hills. But check using your old aerial first. Hopefully this will work with the splitter so we can have old analogue TV in most rooms and then Saorview in the room with the Ariva box. If they drop in price even more, we may buy another one.

So if you are tired of buzzy noisy old-school analogue TV in West Cork or if you are tired of paying the Rupert tax and can live without Sky Sports, you can save yourself a fortune by going down this route.

I have been very bitchy about Saorview since it was announced. It has taken Ireland 13 years to catch-up with the UK's OnDigital/Freeview. I worked in a company that talked to RTE about building a Digital TV box in 1998! Celtic Tiger my arse, more like Celtic fat tabby sitting in front of the fire for a decade, scratching its hole. But now that it is here, I have to say it's very well executed. And €99 for that box is a complete steal.

GG's Turkish Barber in Clonakilty,"We missed another Farmer's Market as myself and Osc spent longer in Clon that we expected. The place was mobbed, jammed with cars on the way to/from holidays and flooded just to make everyone's lives harder. However, none of this interfered with our mission to get our hair cut.

Catherine had noticed a new Turkish Barber had opened up on the ring road in Clon and thought I should check it out. I think it is only open a few weeks at this stage. I poked my head in the door and there were only two other people waiting which suited just fine.

The place looks great. Small but lots of nice touches including a big flat screen TV to keep you occupied. However, the TV was on TG4 which was showing their Saturday movie [A Summer Place](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053320/). It was one of those awful pointless 1950's yokes with no-one you have ever heard of. I hated those movies when I was a kid and they haven't got any better. But I suppose it is a tradition to show crappy movies early on a Saturday afternoon. In any case, there was far more entertainment to be had watching people getting  treated .

We were lucky that the guy in the chair had a beard so we saw lots of the services on offer. The barber was incredibly adept with the scissors and even more so when he took out the cut-throat razor to tidy up the beard. He dipped it in alcohol and then lit it which caused Oscar's eyes to be glued to the remainder of the activities. Of course, he used old style shaving soap and a big brush to foam it up.

Then he upped the game even more - he took a giant cotton bug, dipped it in alcohol, lit it and then started swooping it towards the guys head over and over. Oscar went totally silent. This was presumably to burn off the various dodgy hairs that we older men seem to get in the oddest places.

He finished the guy off with a multitude of unguents and sprays and sent him on his way looking like a million dollars.

There were two more  quick trims  before us. The guy with the comb-over who asked for  not much off the top  was clearly living in a fantasy world all of his own creation but the barber sent him off looking dapper too.

Oscar was next and went up to the chair very nervously. Suddenly he smiled and said  there's a TV stuck in the mirror! . Sadly for him it was also showing TG4\. Normally GG won't do kids on a Saturday cos it is too busy and he is on his own but he was happy to do a machine cut which Osc was cool with too. It took him no time at all to change Oscar from a pseudo-crustie to a fine looking young man. A great haircut.

I was going with my usual zero blade machine cut. Done in 5 mins and far better than I ever do myself. But that was not the end of it, I got the blazing bud treatment too which was fantastic. Then he really freaked me and cut my eyebrows! Ok, so they were getting a bit unkempt but they were hardly Rumpole of the Bailey. I was actually chuffed that he did them.

€20 for the two of us. When I originally saw his price list I thought it was expensive but it is a bargain for the effort he puts in. Next time I'm going for the €32  The Works  which includes traditional hot towel Turkish shave. 

Whether you want a manly treat or just a good hair-cut, give GG's a go.

Gleeson's has been one of our favourite places to eat since we moved to Cork. Not only was the food always excellent but you were always made to feel extremely welcome. However, our last meal there late last year was not fantastic. It wasn't bad, just not great. They also had hired some new waiting staff who were nowhere near as good as the owners themselves. 

But when Granny Mary and Auntie Fiona offered to babysit on Friday we figured we'd give it another go. It was also likely to be our last or second last meal out before number five arrives as Catherine is starting to feel very uncomfortable. 

We went for a 6.30 start and were the first ones in. All new waiting staff greeted us and they were superb for the entire night. I think the main guy was French and he had that attentive but not obsequious approach that they do so well.

We were overjoyed to see that the food is also back to brilliant. I had a simple Smoked Haddock with Welsh Rarebit, Warm Tomato Tart and Basil Pesto to start which was jam-packed with flavour and had beautiful fish. Catherine had Crab, Avocado & Pink Grapefruit Salad with Black Olive Crostini & Saffron Dressing which she totally loved.

I went with Roast Breast of Skeaganore Duck with Red Cabbage, Garlic Potatoes & Port Wine Sauce for main and Catherine had one of the fish of the day (monkfish) with a bearnaise sauce and green beans. Both were fabulous and some plate licking might have gone on in less proper surroundings.

Desserts were equally top notch with Crème Brûlée with a Chocolate Brandy Snap Basket and
Raspberry Sorbet for wifey and a soft meringue with pistachio nut creation for me. Great coffees.

I also have to mention the wine list which is one of the most intelligent i have ever seen. It starts with some good value house wines and then has their special recommendation for the month. We went with the Portuguese red at only €20 which was lovely and light. I have never heard of any of the grapes in it but I'll be keeping an eye out in future. The rest of the list is done by style so you can decide whether you are in the mood for a bone dry white or a heavy red, go to the correct section and then hit your price point. Fantastic idea if, like us, your wine knowledge starts and ends with Sauvignon Blanc.

Any time I have overheard conversations about good restaurants in the area, Gleeson's almost always gets a mention. They deserve it. I didn't notice a 2006 Bridgestone plaque on the wall. I hope that's just because they haven't got around to putting it up. If they don't have one and Forde's do, then I despair.

Go to a parkrun this Saturday in West Cork,"I talked about [parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com/) in my monster post last year on the [future of Ireland's health](http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/21/greenways-byways-hedgerows-tourism-and-the-future-of-irelands-health/). It was started in the UK in 2010 and has spread around the world. In [parkrun Ireland](https://www.parkrun.ie/) there are over 50 events every week. You may have heard it mentioned on [Operation Transformation](https://ot.rte.ie/) too.

![Parkrun](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/parkrun.jpg)

The idea is incredibly simple. Every Saturday at 9.30am, you turn up to your local parkrun and do 5km. You can sprint, run, jog, walk or amble. If you sign up on the web-site, you get a printable barcode so your time can be recorded every week. A few hours after taking part, you'll get all the stats by email.

* [Clonakilty](http://www.parkrun.ie/clonakilty/)
* [Castlehaven](http://www.parkrun.ie/castlehaven/)
* [Macroom](http://www.parkrun.ie/castledemense/)
* [Ballincollig](http://www.parkrun.ie/ballincollig/)
* [Bere Island](http://www.parkrun.ie/bereisland/)
* [Glengarriff](http://www.parkrun.ie/glengarriff/)

We finally signed up 3 weeks ago and headed down to the Clonakilty Show Grounds - it's behind The Boiler for all you West Cork parents reading this :-) The run is 4 loops of the grounds and the participants included everyone from out-and-out speedsters to people having a gentle walk or pushing a buggy. There is no pressure to ""perform"" and you can never come last, as they always have an organiser at the back.

The organisers are *you*. Every week it's run by those who volunteer. I've done three runs now and it's starting to approach the time I volunteer and do my bit.

Clon had 40ish people each of the weeks I've been there and it's brilliant to see the Operation Transformation walkers out too. It's an extremely welcoming setup where they do a shout-out to all newbies and all the ""tourists"" from other parkruns.

I'm interested in doing Ballincollig too but the numbers there are wonderfully nuts (approx 400 people!). We'll delicately skip over the nonsensical situation in Tramore Valley Park that caused this.

I also really want to try Bere Island. I love the idea of getting on a ferry out to an island to do a run. But it's a bit of a trip down the Beara peninsula to get there for 9.30am. Maybe when the mornings are a bit brighter.

Someone on Twitter recently suggested doing one in Bandon. I think this is a superb idea but with some logistical issues. parkruns are done in open spaces, not on paths or roads. So the options I think we have are (with the associated challenges):

* Bandon RFC - Everyone would have to be out of there before 10.30 when the crowds really start building for the matches/training. Only a problem in winter.
* GAA - Not sure when training happens here. It's the most central with lots of parking too.
* Town Park - Would interfere with Saturday soccer. Also very little parking.
* Bandon Grammar - Not sure if the hockey pitch is suitable. And again, training clashes.
* Golf Club driving range - It's a bit far out but it's almost exactly 1km around so it would be 5 simple loops and people have been running there for years.

One hope for the future is that Castlebernard is mentioned in some [very cool plans by Cork CoCo](http://corklocalareaplans.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Draft-Bandon-Kinsale-MD-LAP.pdf) (note that's a PDF) for Bandon. I don't know if those plans are just ideas or have actually been agreed with the owners. If there was a riverside path out to there with a run around some new tracks, that would fantastic for parkrun and make Bandon a really attractive place to visit.

Any other suggestions for how we could do it?

So come on, overcome your self-consciousness and self-confidence issues and give it a go. You don't even need a pair of runners or running gear. Come out for a walk and see what you think. Watch this old fart staggering around out-of-breath trying to break my Personal Best time and maybe you might consider a jog at some point in the future. No one is judging you, they are applauding you for giving it a go.

Say hello if I convinced you to try it :-)

Here's Dawn Nisbet in the UK who started and never looked back. Her picture has [gone viral](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-38731822).

Finally, please read [this brilliant blogpost](http://www.runselfierepeat.com/blog/the-fastest-way-to-get-a-perfect-body) by Kelly Roberts. I absolutely love her [BQ or Bust YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAMukAUAEGn0Ij1N195BuGw/videos) but this piece on the fastest way to get a perfect body just nails it."
Goat's Cheese and Pregnancy,"We were in The English Market on Friday getting a few bits. I was buying the membrillo in Iago which is the bigger of the two cheese places. In passing, as Catherine is preggers, I asked if they had any pasteurised goat's cheese. The person I asked didn't know but one of the other ladies came over and said that no goat's cheese or sheep's cheese is safe to eat during pregnancy because listeria is not killed by pasteurisation. We were a bit stunned as we are pretty sure Catherine has eaten some of the harder goat's cheeses on the other pregnancies.

When we went home, she checked her library of pregnancy books and they all said that listeria is killed by pasteurisation. So what is the reality? Is listeria a red herring?  Are there any safe non-cow cheeses during pregnancy? In any case, what are the stats on problems occuring? Ignoring goats for a moment, what is the problem with soft cheeses like brie if they are pasteurised?

Let's use that collective swarm intelligence out there to create a bizarre answer to this conundrum and post it to Wikipedia.

[tags]Listeria, Goat's Cheese, Chevre, Brie, Pasteurisation, Pasteurization, Iago, English Market[/tags]"
GoEat.ie  -  anyone else checked it out?,"I discovered [goeat.ie](http://www.goeat.ie/) recently and have been looking around the site. Overall it seems well designed and they have the usual bunch of reviews and competitions and recipes that you would expect on any food site.

They also have the first ever Irish Video Blogs (according to them). A very neat idea but to be honest the videos are brutal. They look like the sort of thing they used to show in the Savoy Cinema on O'Connell Street years ago before the movie. Long sweeping shots of the restaurant and you are just waiting for them to say ""After the feature presentation, why not pop next door to the Khyber Pass Tandoori and experience our range of international Vesta cuisine"".

I looked at their video reviews of both Wagamama and The Mongolian BBQ. They didn't have a negative word to say about either of them (apart from some gentle dig at Wagamama about it not being a place you ""dine""). I think this may be a bigger problem than it first appears. On the home page they have a link for restauranteurs. Is it a case that they are trying to play both sides of the field? If so, they will find it very hard to gain credibility with consumers. They need to tread very carefully there.

But all in all, they deserve support for trying to do a decent foodie portal. Check them out.

One other dig: Don't advertise web-design expertise when your web-site throws a SQL Server error if people with apostrophes in their names (a huge chunk of the Irish population) enter that name to take part in a competition. Tut tut, I'll accept that beginners mistake from US web-sites but not from Irish ones.

And because I am in a crabby humor - where are the RSS feeds boys? You can't do Video Blogs and have ads for iTunes and not have RSS. I know you are worried that you will lose advertising revenue but I am actually open to ads in RSS feeds as long as they are small, unobtrusive and relevant.

A few weeks back we took a run to Skibbereen to see if there was anything special in the Farmer's Market with the [Taste of West Cork Food Festival](http://www.skibbereen.ie/taste-of-west-cork.htm) being on. Sadly it seemed to be the usual fare with a few great stalls including the awesome Gubbeen stand along with the standard crusties selling knitted bodhrans. We were very disappointed and I've only just realised from reading the web-site that the big food event was on the Sunday - damn damn damn.

We tootled off to Union Hall for some grub and had three pubs to choose from. We randomly selected Dinty's which is a lovely airy pub and was not too busy yet (around 12.30). The barman was friendly and good with the kids and I grabbed a few menus off him. I was immediatley very disappointed by the selection of seafood for a few reasons. They call themselves a seafood restaurant, they have a picture of lobster on their sign outside, they are 20 yards from an awesome fish shop and wholesalers (Antcar) and they are in a fishing port! 

I went with fish pie whilst Catherine and the kids all had plaice plus a few rounds of chips. I have to hand it to them, they broke the current record holder for getting fish to people in a pub who have kids by a couple of minutes. Up until now that record was held by the Bosun in Monkstown which is a fantastic pub/restaurant. I think Dinty's did it in under 4 minutes which meant the kids didn't even have a chance to think about misbehaving. They know their stuff in this place.

My fish pie was good but the plaice was superb - top top quality and ultra fresh from what I could see. A few leaves on the plate were dressed well but they shouldn't have bothered with it for the kiddies. Chips excellent.

Lunch/Dinner for two adults and 3.5 kids plus one pint and soft drinks came to over €60 which I found pricey. By the time we were leaving the place was mobbed and with good reason. Recommended for good solid food. Next time we'll try the other places and compare.

Sadly it seemed to be the usual fare with a few great stalls including the awesome Gubbeen stand along with the standard crusties selling knitted bodhrans. We were very disappointed and I've only just realised from reading the web-site that the big food event was on the Sunday - damn damn damn.

We tootled off to Union Hall for some grub and had three pubs to choose from. We randomly selected Dinty's which is a lovely airy pub and was not too busy yet (around 12.30). The barman was friendly and good with the kids and I grabbed a few menus off him. I was immediatley very disappointed by the selection of seafood for a few reasons.

Good Things Cafe should be called Awesome Things Cafe,"Two days of fantastic fish recipes by a wonderful teacher in  a perfect setting. Not much more to say than that. But I will.

Three years ago I did a cookery course down in Good Things Cafe with Carmel Somers. It was honestly two of the best food days I've ever had. The relentless pressure of start-up business life meant I didn't get to return until this month. Now I can't wait to go again.

Durrus is a gorgeous little village just at the start of the Sheep's Head Peninsula. Good Things is just out a bit on the Ahakista Road looking out over the bay and the mussel farms. It is a cafe during the summer and a cookery school for the rest of the year.

A collection  of maybe 10 of us there on the first day. A mixture of individuals, friends and mother/daughter. Only two of us were blokes. What is it with men? It's 2009, not 1959.

Click on the image for the full album of pictures that I took:

[![04102009738](http://photos5.pix.ie/36/60/3660A10E74884CAF9BB97BBFFC4B0063-500.jpg)](http://pix.ie/conor/1317958/in/album/359380 ""Good Things Cafe"")

There is always a worry that demo-only courses can be tiring to concentrate on for two days. I have the attention span of a gnat and generally have to be doing things to stop my mind wandering. I needn't have had any concern. Carmel kept us engaged and entertained for the entire thing. Each day was over in the blink of an eye and I wanted more each time!

The recipes are all simple, tasty and doable by anyone who can wield a knife. OK maybe not by those two nutters on the opening episode of The Restaurant this week who tried to open a coconut with a knife and rolling pin :-)

The recipes included:

*   Alioli
*   Brown Rice with garlic
*   Fish Stock
*   Omelette Arnold Bennett
*   Fish Ceviche
*   Kedgeree
*   Fish Cakes with Salsa
*   Chowder
*   St Emilion au Chocolat
*   Brown Soda Scones
*   Crab Tart
*   Short Crust Pastry
*   Garlic Croutons
*   Fish Soup
*   Braised Fennel with Cumin and Ginger

As each thing was cooked, we all got to taste it and sip on a glass of wine. They were all winners. I only saw one person react negatively to one dish in two days and that was the squid which I know some people just have a problem with. 

Carmel's assistant Joy also deserves a special mention for all her hard work and friendly attentiveness on both days. 

Those on the course were all lovely and extremely friendly. This wasn't a bunch of foodies trying to out-do each other in their knowledge of single-estate extra-virgin olive oils. Just normal folks who like food and wanted an interesting weekend away. There was even someone living in Ratoath where my mother is from who knows my Aunt's shop really well.

Carmel was a big meanie and wouldn't let me record video like the last time. I had hoped to post a bunch of stuff to Qik and YouTube. Hopefully her daughter will get her doing video now that they are on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/goodthingscafe) too.

Just like the last time, all I can say is, just do it. They have a wide range of courses and it's a wonderful part of the country. It's not expensive and you'll come away excited by food again. I described myself as a lapsed cook that weekend and it looks like Carmel has brought me back into the flock :-)

She has also just launched her first cookbook called ""Eat Good Things Every Day"". It looks brilliant and I'll definitely be buying a copy.

Good Wine Show Day 1 Fantastic!,"We spent this evening in the Clarion Hotel in Cork attending the fantastic inaugural Good Wine Show, held by Curious Wines, Bubble Brothers and Karwig Wines.

I'm not going to say much, I'll let all the videos I took do the talking. Suffice to say that €15 to sample over 100 fantastic wines plus cheese from On The Pigs Back, bread from Arbutus and amazing smoked Duck, Salmon and Chicken from Ummera is an absolute steal. So get on over to the Clarion tomorrow from 11am and have an absolute blast. We did!

Goodbye My Friend Bikila #VFF,"{{< youtube pqLRH6gS6c0 >}}


In March 2011, after doing 2 Half Marathons and a 10k, I was close to giving up on running. Every time I got on a treadmill in my ASICs, I got crippling shin-splints within minutes. It was like trying to run with two solid wooden peg legs. Running on grass was only slightly better.

18 months prior to that I had also destroyed my ankle by going over sideways on it twice in quick succession. A bunch of physio had helped and given me back some proprioception but I was still very nervous on uneven surfaces. I also got terrible pains during running in my ankle and foot where all the damage had occurred. Did I mention my scarily clicky knees? And of course, I was diagnosed with ""fallen arches"" as a kid after complaining that walking hurt. Picking up pencils with my toes never really sorted that out :-)

So the day I tried running in my socks on the treadmill was hugely momentous for me. I ran like a small child on a beach. No pain, none. All gone. Then a bunch of people recommended Vibram Five Fingers and everything changed forever.

I got my first pair, Bikilas, in John Buckley Sports in Cork and they were a revelation. I have honestly never looked back. Those Bikilas did The Bandon Half Marathon, the Amsterdam Half Marathon, The Bandon 10k and finally, last Monday, the Cork Half Marathon. They have also done a few hundred km on a treadmill and some local road and grass running.

[![](http://www.barefoot.ie/shop/images/Bikila%20Red.jpg)](http://www.barefoot.ie/shop/index.php?main_page=product_infoandcPath=6andproducts_id=24andzenid=a2l119ar7cehhitfi3qtpmcum5)

Of course they get laughs, questions and stares, rightly so. I'm always up for the slagging about them. Hell, I now own them, a pair of Trek Sports and a pair of KSO Treks so I'm setting myself up for some ribbing. But I'll never go back to traditional running shoes. I can't.

The only issue I have found with the Bikilas is running on Irish back-roads in those races. Unlike footpaths or nice tarmac, we have a horrible surface on most Irish R routes. The stones rise up out of the tar and create a really knobbly surface. After 21km on that, I always end up with two big blisters on the balls of my feet. I'm probably exacerbating it by landing on the inside of my foot.

Most people worry about the impact on your feet, ankles, knees and hips of running with no padding but it's honestly the complete opposite. You land on the front of your foot, not your heel, so your foot does what it evolved to do: take the impact. My problem above is surface quality, not the fact that it's a road.

I've also been getting new blisters on the Bikilas so my guess is that they are knackered. I'm not sure they were designed to handle this amount of weight :-) I've worn the heels away quite badly but I don't feel like I am heel striking so maybe that's just a natural outcome or the treadmill is catching the back of them.

So it's time to retire them and plan my next moves. First I'm going to try my [Trek Sports](http://www.barefoot.ie/shop/index.php?main_page=product_infoandcPath=9andproducts_id=75andzenid=q2c0e4b2pd8spea4rt6h0ciip1) for running. I see people complaining they lose foot-feel with them but that's what I want on Irish roads. The extra knobbly bits on the sole may be perfect for the bad surfaces. I'll also focus on adjusting how I land on my foot to aim more for the middle. And of course I need to do more road running to toughen the skin on the balls of my feet.

[![](http://www.barefoot.ie/shop/images/TrekSport-m4485-top.jpg)](http://www.barefoot.ie/shop/index.php?main_page=product_infoandcPath=6andproducts_id=126andzenid=8sd05ohnrmkg5hts4sbhf3hji2)

If I find the Treksports too clunky then I think my next pair will be [Bikila LS](http://www.barefoot.ie/shop/index.php?main_page=product_infoandcPath=6andproducts_id=126andzenid=8sd05ohnrmkg5hts4sbhf3hji2). They have an expandable top which for someone with a high instep like me, should make them a slightly better fit than the Bikila.

[![](http://www.barefoot.ie/shop/images/Bikila_LS-M358-hero.jpg)](http://www.barefoot.ie/shop/index.php?main_page=product_infoandcPath=6andproducts_id=126andzenid=8sd05ohnrmkg5hts4sbhf3hji2)

If you are thinking about Vibrams or similar shoes but are afraid to try, please leave your questions below. I am the most atypical runner ever - I'm still 3 stone overweight and apparently (according to my sister-in-law) I run awkwardly.

Oh a final side-note. We found out recently that the main disties for VFFs in Ireland, [barefoot.ie](http://barefoot.ie), are based in the Rubicon Centre in CIT in Cork. So support local!

UPDATE: How could I do a post on Vibram Five Fingers and not mention this brilliant XKCD from last week:

Google Adsense - $4 in 5 months. Finally I can buy that Audi RS6,"For fun, I set up Google AdSense last year. It is behind those ads you see in the sidebar of the blog. I didn't expect to make much money and never thought I'd be able to live off the Ad revenue.

I just checked my total income  and it is now at $4.02! Woo hoo. It seems to me that there is a very good reason for it - the ads are complete shite.

At least 80% of the blog is about food but it almost never includes food ads. I never ever mention dating but there is always some poxy ad for a dating agency. I once mentioned a Ford Mustang and for weeks had ads for US car dealers. The day they do ads for hair transplants, I'm taking them off the site.

Having said all of that, I added an Amazon ad recently for comparison and only selected food as a category. Income to date? £0.00!

Oh well, I'll just stick to the day job then.

Google Health + Android + CardioTrainer has me excited,"<div>

Yesterday I did my first ever [Half Marathon in Dingle](http://dinglemarathon.ie/). Yes it nearly killed me and I had to walk lots of it but I finished and I had several hundred people behind me. Compared to some of my friends who regularly do Triathlons, my achievement is nothing special. But for someone who spent 20 years sedentary and started running in January, aged 41, with a gippy ankle and hugely overweight, I'm pretty proud of myself.

One application I have been using is [CardioTrainer](http://www.worksmartlabs.com/cardiotrainer) on my Android phone. It started as a pretty simple app but just gets better and better with each revision. It uses GPS to record distance, speed and elevation as you exercise. The most recent version finally has a ""permanent account"" feature so you can change phones and keep your exercise history. It saves everything on the phone and online. It also posts to Facebook which I love.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/screenshot_4.png ""CardioTrainer"")](http://www.worksmartlabs.com/)

Last night whilst watching TV with my completely seized up left knee, I played a little more with it and suddenly discovered it has [Google Health](http://health.google.com) integration. This is a service that has always intrigued me but I had never used. Unlike many people, I would love to have a permanent online store of all my records that all my health providers would input to and read from. No more silos. My GP, various hospitals, physios etc could update and access what is appropriate to them.

So this afternoon I signed up for Google Health and connected CardioTrainer to it. I've been sitting here for the past hour looking at it with some ""big ideas"" bubbling around in my head. They are not quite formed but it goes something like this.

1.  Android phones will become ubiquitous in the next two years
2.  You can already get basic models for £100 un-subsidised in the UK
3.  CardioTrainer is free in its basic form. They just released a calorie counter app and have an inexpensive weigh-loss app
4.  Google Health is free
5.  There is some opportunity around tracking your exercise, eating, weight, etc and uploading via CardioTrainer to Google Health
6.  Your health professionals could track your progress and give advice, feedback and encouragement
7.  The HSE could hand out those phones and create a preventative care group for billions less than it costs to deal with the health problems related to obesity, diabetes, alcohol, heart disease, smoking etc etc etc. Hell they could even outsource the whole thing to Malaysia.
8.  Someone from FourSquare could help with gaming dynamics to build incentive systems into these apps to encourage people to get healthy
9.  Think ""Operation Transformation"" for everyone
10.  If Google wanted to do it themselves, they could finally find a practical use for Latitude.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/google_health.jpg ""Google Health"")](http://health.google.com/)

Ok, so you can see where I am going with this. As I said, the idea isn't fully formed but there is something valuable here centered around cheap mobile technology, the cloud and the health of our country.

Gourmet Burger gone already! Bugger.,"Ah crap. [JD posted a comment here](http://conoroneill.com/2006/06/18/marmatiece-restaurant-bandon/#comment-34601) earlier letting me know that he went to Gourmet Burger in Portlaoise the other day and they have already closed down to concentrate on their Dublin business. I'm so pissed off about this. I don't think it is lack of market in this case, but lack of marketing. How many thousand cars go up and down the N7 and N8 every day? I never once saw an ad for them. I did see some attempt at putting a truck trailer on the side of the road at Christmas with ads for the overall Food Court but that's it. People do need to know you exist before they'll try your business.

<strike>Anthony from [Ummera](http://www.ummera.com/) mentioned to them that I had blogged about them. Not once did they contact me or post a comment on this blog telling us what they were trying to do and how they'd love it if people would tell their friends. For gods sake, it would've been free advertising. Arrggggggh. Clueless Train Manifesto.</strike>

<strike>Surely someone with a bit more marketing nous and budget can make a go of such a great idea in an ideal location?</strike>

UPDATE 1: David from Gourmet Burger [has posted an excellent comment here](http://conoroneill.com/2007/02/13/gourmet-burger-gone-already-bugger/#comment-35755) explaining exactly why they shut down Port Laoise. It makes total sense.

Great new Art Gallery in West Cork,"Haydn Shaughnessy is opening [a new art gallery](http://www.galleryica.com/) in the Pink Elephant in Harbour View overlooking the sea. As its name suggests it is dedicated to Innovative Contemporary Art.

The official launch is on May 31st but you can see some of the exhibitors over at the web-site which is really beautifully designed. [Haydn has blogged it here](http://www.mediangler.com/2007/05/15/gallery-site-is-up/) and mentions that two of my favourite photo-bloggers, [Ryan](http://rymus.net/) and [Donncha](http://inphotos.org/) should be exhibiting there soon.

I love what Haydn is trying to do with the gallery - highlighting those who are trying push things forward and use new technologies and tools in art.

Great art in a breathtaking location, what more could you ask for?

You'll find it on the coast road from Kinsale to Clonakilty near Kilbrittain."
Great news for fishies in West Cork,"So if food lovers are foodies and wine lovers are winos ;-) I've decided that fish lovers are fishies. Just got a comment on [an old blog post](http://conoroneill.com/2005/12/04/hey-dad-thats-the-same-ugly-fish-as-last-week) about the fish shop in Union Hall and it's all good news:
> we Glenmar Shellfish have now merged with Antcar over 12mths ago - if you are ever in Union Hall again be sure and call into the shop again - The Fish Shop - you will not be disappointed - we have recently extended the shop and added alot of additional products to our impressive array of fish - including mussels !!- we also now have a wine licence and stock a very impressive selection of wines - look forward to seeing you soon!!

The Walkist Manifesto - From Greenways to pathways everywhere and the future of Ireland's health,"## Intro
I began this post several months ago. It started quite simply - I wanted to congratulate those behind the wonderful [Waterford/Deise Greenway](http://www.deisegreenway.com/) and encourage Cork County Council to embrace a West Cork Greenway and execute on it. The Waterford one is partially opening this week.

![Waterford Greenway](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bridge.jpg)

However the more I thought about it, the bigger the ""vision"" got. What I'm going to present here is obvious in many places, controversial in others and possibly pure fantasy. But we simply can't continue to stagger blindly forward, as we have been doing for decades. It's time for a fundamental change in how the infrastructure of this country is arranged.

Teddy Roosevelt, 1903: 

> We are not building this country of ours for a day. It is to last through the ages. We stand on the threshold of a new century. We look into the dim years that rise before us, knowing that if we are true that the generations that succeed us here shall fall heir to a heritage such as has never been known before. I ask that we keep in mind not only our own interests, but the interests of our children. Any generation fit to do its work must work for the future, for the people of the future, as well as for itself.

## Let's start small and talk local first - Bandon and Clonakilty Paths
Running or walking in Bandon for health in an exercise in aggravation. I was really pleased when they decided to name a nice short walk by the river after Graham Norton and the old railway walk after Clare O'Leary. But it doesn't look like a single person in the County Council thought it would be a good idea to connect the two of them together. So if you want to make use of the nearby railway walk, you either drive there (many do!) or you risk life and limb on a one-foot wide hard shoulder with cars racing by at 100+kph and regularly crashing into each other.

Every road out of Bandon stops just as the houses do and leaves you in mortal danger if you want to go any further on foot. Anyone who cycles from Bandon to Innishannon is very brave indeed.

Like many Irish towns, Bandon has a love-hate relationship with its river. It's lovely in the few small places you can see it. But it's a beast that has damaged the town too. That relationship was typified by the Bandon Half Marathon and 10K which was run for a few years without a single view of the river. I'm convinced a marathon along the river would attract big crowds. Imagine a Bandon to Kinsale run, via Innishannon, on a permanent river trail.

But Bandon is just one local symptom. Look at Clonakilty and Inchydoney. A beach rated as the best in Ireland by Trip Advisor users has a path out towards it that stops at exactly one mile. From then on, grit your teeth and hope some moron doesn't plough you down if you want to walk or run the remaining miles.

Most of the rest of the country is exactly the same.

There are some bright lights - look at the ring road in Kilkenny any evening. It's jammed with people walking and running. Why? Because they can travel everywhere safely on foot. Literally if you build it they will come.

The Public Bike Scheme in cities also shows what happens when you provide the facilities and infrastructure. [Public bike scheme numbers show cycling is becoming more popular](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/public-bike-scheme-numbers-show-cycling-is-becoming-more-popular-751422.html?utm_source=iosapp&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=sharebutton)


## Waterford Greenway
Earlier in the year I heard about the [Waterford Greenway](http://www.deisegreenway.com/) and got very excited. The idea of being able to safely run, walk or cycle from Waterford to Dungarvan along the old railway line struck me as inspirational. I'm still shocked it has actually happened. I've been on it three times now, ahead of its completion and it far exceeds every expectation I had. The views are stunning, the terrain changes all the time and everything about it puts a huge smile on my face. Given how many people I've met on the Greenway in its unfinished state, I can't wait to see it when it's finished.

![Waterford Greenway 2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CszYeE4XgAEnIq6.jpg)


The important thing about the Greenway (and the [Great Western one](http://www.greenway.ie/) and the upcoming [Cavan/Leitrim one](http://candlgreenway.ie/)) is that it's a facility for everyone, not just tourists. And that idea became the heart of my thoughts on this wider topic.

## West Cork Greenway
Cork CoCo has a ""policy"" of creating a West Cork Greenway. An [excellent study](http://www.corkcoco.ie/co/pdf/562780142.pdf) (warning direct PDF link) was carried out in 2011, which figured out the how, where and cost. But nothing has happened. I don't want to particularly slag off the new not-Alcatraz in the the middle of a freezing cold harbour, as it seems to be off to a good start in peak tourist season. But no one is travelling to Cork to see that. Imagine spending all of that money instead on a perspex enclosed walk across a refurbished Chetwynd Viaduct followed by a renovated Ballinhassig tunnel. It would rightly become world famous.

## Joining the dots
Now think about an East Cork Greenway. And a New Ross Greenway. And a Rosslare Greenway. And a Dublin to Wexford Greenway. Imagine being able to safely travel on foot or bike from Dublin to Wexford to Waterford to Cork to Barley Cove to Glengarrif to Kenmare to Killarney to Tralee and Dingle.

Dammit, build a walking trail around the entire coast of Ireland. Something to make the whole world wake up and pay attention.

It looks like Northern Ireland has the right idea. [NI greenways: 600-mile network could get Stormont green light](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-37355509)

## The Wild Atlantic Way
I have been extremely impressed with the [Wild Atlantic Way](http://www.wildatlanticway.com/home) marketing campaign. Hell, they make me want to move to Ireland and I live here. But that's all it is, a marketing campaign. The only obvious capital spend outside of marketing is for signage.

The core problem is that they show all these amazing places you can visit in Ireland and every single one of them requires you to drive there (or risk your neck cycling), since walking or running there would be suicidal.

We live on a stunning beautiful island. The Wild Atlantic Way should be The Wild Irish way for all of us, not just tourists.

{{< youtube R8DeYWxmtnc >}}

## National Parks
This is a long section and after Greenways was supposed to be the bulk of this post. But it just made me have even bigger ideas. So bear with me, we'll get there.

2016 is the Centennial of the [US National Parks Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/centennial/index.htm) and they are doing a wonderful job promoting that fact. My only experiences of them was a day in Yosemite in 1996 and a day in Grand Canyon in 1998 and both are ingrained on my mind forever.

Let's start by comparing the mission statement of the [Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service](http://www.npws.ie/national-parks) and the US National Parks Service.

> It is the policy of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, endorsed by successive governments, to abide by the criteria and standards for National Parks as set by the IUCN.

vs

> The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world.

Jesus. Are you as depressed as I was when I read the Irish one?


I had to Google to find out if we even had a National Parks service. I have been in one and to be fair, it's bloody brilliant - Killarney National Park. Check my earlier post on my Marathon there. But I've also done the Half Marathon down from Moll's Gap. The park is just fantastic. And in keeping with my theme, was full of both tourists and locals when I was there.

There have been some very positive things happening around the National Parks. The government [bought 5000 acres](http://www.ahrrga.gov.ie/expansion-of-the-wicklow-mountains-national-park/) in Wicklow that NAMA was trying to hawk to some vulture funds.


But why do we only have six parks? Why not one in every county? Why aren't we buying up land that is of minimal agricultural use and using it in the style of the Americans? Roughly [640 million acres](http://www.irunfar.com/2016/08/a-trail-runners-primer-on-public-lands.html), or almost a third of the US, fall under the auspices of the federal government.

Obama gets it, why don't we?
{{< youtube djDx6LKRFdQ >}}

&nbsp;

[Google also gets it](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-us-national-parks), why don't we?

Let's stop playing with [mickey-mouse Rural Recreation funding](http://www.ahrrga.gov.ie/e4-455-million-approved-by-minister-ring-for-75-rural-recreation-projects/), welcome tho it is, and do this right. 


## Pedestrian hostile in two generations
Hillwalkers and outdoorsey people are a very specific segment. We need to be casting the net much wider and make walking the default for everyone, not the exception.

How did we go in two generations from being a piss poor country that couldn't afford cars to one which is actively pedestrian hostile? We went from every kid cycling or walking to school and even university to almost zero.

Why did we sleepwalk into this?

The World Health Organization estimates that 1.25 million people die from car-related injuries per year. Half of the deaths are pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists hit by cars. Cars are the leading cause of death for people ages 15–29 years old.

Let's not forget cyclists who are regularly killed. The recent decision in Dublin to [postpone the bicycle greenways](http://www.thejournal.ie/cycling-greenways-2964771-Sep2016/) does not bode well for anything I'm proposing here.

On a positive note, in Cork [COUNCILS GET INTO GEAR FOR MORE CYCLE TRACKS](http://www.eveningecho.ie/cork-news/councils-get-gear-cycle-tracks/2524009/). A blueprint for the development of new cycle lanes and tracks across Cork city and its suburbs has been published jointly by Cork city and county councils.


## Health
There are lots of people trying to do good work around health and fitness here, in the private, public and quango sectors. But it's mostly siloed, piecemeal or, in the case of something like National Fitness Day, tokenistic.

UPDATE 2: A great example of looking like you are doing something but really just ticking boxes is [A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025](http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/ministers-launch-a-healthy-weight-for-ireland-obesity-policy-and-action-plan-2016-2025/). Even the most naive of us go into full eyeroll mode when we see press releases that prattle on about guidelines, forums and stakeholders. The only surprise is that they didn't announce another taskforce.

In contrast, a great example of actually doing something practical is the [Parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com/) movement. A recent tweet by the organisation in the UK said:

> A whopping 92,432 people crossed a parkrun finish line in the UK this weekend 

The problem is that 92k is not whopping in a country of 64 million people where 62% of people are overweight or obese. A more fundamental change is needed rather than events which will never be more than niche for people who already want to change.

And whilst it's great to see Coillte adding things like Zipit in Farran wood, it costs money to use those things. It also costs money to park there. And you'd be suicidal to try and get there on foot. 

*Health shouldn't require wealth.*

This isn't a new problem. In 1963 JFK was horrified by the stats he saw about the declining fitness of young people. He kicked off a range of initiatives including a set of 50 mile events which were hugely popular that year. RFK even completed a 50 miler. But then JFK was assassinated. Very quickly the events petered out and now there is [only one 50 miler left](http://www.jfk50mile.org/history/). Which someday I hope to do.

How do we get the people who need to move the most moving, but who are least likely to do so?

What percentage of our multi-billion-Euro health budget is spent dealing with preventable no-exercise related diseases?

Things like Autonomous cars are only going to make things worse. Do we really want to end up like L.A. Story?

{{< youtube 3gP_ErrRILk >}}

&nbsp;

UPDATE 3: As an aside, I completely agree with [@thoughtwax](https://twitter.com/thoughtwax/status/778915462683979776) that 

> autonomous cars will present a once in a lifetime opportunity to reclaim public space for people 

Once we are 100% autonomous, driving related deaths should also drop to almost zero. And drink driving becomes a thing of the past. It could even herald the return of the rural pub. But I'm still concerned that an always-available fleet of autonomous Uber vehicles will have us all eventually looking like characters out of Wall-E.

There is a great piece in the Irish Times on obesity. [Ian O’Riordan: We are sports mad but sanity needed to tackle obesity](http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/ian-o-riordan-we-are-sports-mad-but-sanity-needed-to-tackle-obesity-1.2794132#.V9xTtrZY9qI.twitter): 

> Indeed there is something strangely contradictory about all this talk of overweight adults and children and the rise of obesity, which according to some reports, will be hovering somewhere around 90 per cent of the population by 2030, the highest projected level Europe. You don’t need me to repeat the scary thought that one in four Irish children is now considered to be overweight, because for a country that prides itself on being so mad about sport, that makes little sense.


## Sidenote - Dogs and dog shit
I'm getting to the point where I think dogs need to be temporarily banned from all public footpaths until a large proportion of their idiot owners stop behaving like 12th century peasants throwing their shit out onto the street. 

Pick up your dogs' shit and put your dog on a goddammed leash, you morons. I've had two little unleashed runt-sized dogs snapping at my heels recently when out on runs. The next one gets a kick in the face. 

Waterford is thinking of banning dogs from the Greenway. Given that it's already riddled with dog shit before it's open, they are 100% right. On one of my runs there, a woman had a large dog on a harness and struggled to control it as it tried to jump at me and attack me.  

But there's actually a revenue opportunity here. Dog-walking arenas. Places that dog-owners can go to walk their dogs, step in each others shit and break up the dog-fights. Lots of farmers could create these.

Here's hoping that responsible reasonable dog owners shame the idiots into behaving properly.

## France
France has lots of problems but seems to have some vision for walkers. We went to a holiday/caravan park in Marennes this year, south of La Rochelle, for the second time. Many people who go to these kind of places never leave the camp except maybe to drive to the supermarket. I know we've been guilty of that.

This year I decided to be different and went for two runs in the locality. I was, to be honest, a bit worried beforehand, as I didn't know the roads at all. Some Google Streetview calmed me. On my first run, I did a short 4km loop around some back roads. And it was an absolute joy. Why? No damned hedges and a grass verge that was flush with the road. Plenty of the usual little white French vans passed me but [a] I could see them coming for ages and [b] I could take a small step sideways to be 100% safe.

![France Verge](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/verge.jpg)


For my second run, I went much further afield and was thrilled to discover an offical nature trail. This was created just with basic crushed white rock and was a lovely surface to run on. 

![France 2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160723_083535.jpg)

The return leg was on a very busy road. But again, it wasn't a problem. No hedges, and big flat verge. We'll get back to hedges in a moment.

But it's not just summer holiday locations where the French are looking at this. [In Paris, Plans for a Seine Reinvention](http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/05/in-paris-plans-for-a-river-seine-reinvention/392639/). Mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced an ""almost philosophical project"" to take the famed river's quayside back from cars. 

Meanwhile in Dublin.........['It's bananas!'](http://www.thejournal.ie/cycling-greenways-2964771-Sep2016/) Fury as funding pulled for Dublin cycling projects.


## Re-forestation, Wildlands, Wetlands
This bit is critical for the next bit. We need a massive re-forestion of the country and the annexing of large areas for wildlife and plants. Every idle bit of land and farmland should be planted with native species (not poxy pines obviously). This is not for commercial purposes, tho that needn't be excluded in all cases. It ties into the National Park idea but more importantly, it gives wildlife and birds somewhere permanent away from the regular cutting of hedgerows.

And before you tell me that it will take decades, [India Plants 50 million trees in one day](https://gearjunkie.com/india-plants-50-million-trees-one-day). Or [How millions of trees brought a broken landscape back to life](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/national-forest-woodland-midlands-regeneration).
It's that vision thing again.


## Hedgerows
OK, now for the controversial bit that I'm sure you saw coming. It's time to get rid of all our our roadside hedgerows and ditches. All of them. Wait, wait, before you blow a gasket and start calling me names. First, we need that massive re-forestation programme to ensure that birds and wildlife have somewhere to go.

The main impediment to people being able to walk safely everywhere is [a] visibility and [b] having somewhere to put their feet. The removal of all hedges and the covering over of all ditches deals with this. I've noticed a lot of ditch covering locally on small roads recently, but of course it's not being done in a way that anyone could actually walk on. So this is eminently possible.

If you do one of the loops of the wonderful [Lusitania Trail](http://conoroneill.com/2016/08/26/the-seven-heads-walk-and-lusitania-trail-is-one-of-west-corks-best-kept-secrets/), this is the road you have to walk back on, with cars whizzing by at 100kph. It's not something I would ever do by choice.

![Irish Roads](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/irish_roads.jpg)

The government should CPO every roadside ditch and hedge. This removes the current nonsense where hedge cuttting is the landowners responsibility and can only happen during certain months due to nests. Get rid of the lot and the birds can go back to their natural pre-road habitats.

UPDATE 1: [A good link](http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/county-heritage-services/news/view-article/article/new-initiatives-launched-to-safeguard-irelands-unique-hedgerows/) from my sister around a new initiative to safeguard hedgerows in Ireland. Just to be clear, I'm talking about creating far more hedgerows and wilderness areas than we have now, just not beside roads.

## A New Ireland
This has been a very long run up to the idea that a whole new outlook is needed in Ireland. We need a grand revolutionary vision and plan for the health of our people and then the execution of that plan quickly. It can't be years of consultants reports and local government jollies and civil servant conservatism. 

Do the current generation of politicians and public servants in this country want to be forgotten in a few short years due to being bench-warmers who think keeping a steady hand on the tiller is their only job? Or do they want to be like Teddy Roosevelt, JFK, Donagh O'Malley and T. K. Whitaker, still being talked about decades later?

Of course we can't do a ""big bang deployment"", as we say in software. It has to be iterative but based on a core set of principles. We could start tomorrow.

* Every child should be able to walk and cycle safely to school. Build pathways to every school in the country spreading out like a spider's web
* Move all religious education to after-school opt-in per religion. Replace all of that school time with outdoor activities, no matter what the weather.
* Everyone should be able to walk and cycle safely from every town to every town in this country
* Give pedestrians the Right of Way by default everywhere. Cars must stop if you want to cross the road. [Why Sweden has so few road deaths](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/02/economist-explains-16)
* Everyone from the Dept of Env, County/City Councils, HSE, NRA, OPW, Coillte and every relevant department and quango are told exactly how they are going to be part of the solution
* In advance of a massive buy-up of land for the National Parks, do a huge expansion of the [Walks Scheme](http://www.housing.gov.ie/community/rural-development/walks-scheme/walks-scheme) to make trails available everywhere
* Start major re-forestation immediately
* Start removing all hedgerows on major roads initially

Yes this will eventually be a grand building program and require large capital investment. For the pathways, it doesn't have to be expensive pavement or tarmac or cobble lock everywhere. Crushed hard core is sufficient. But it also can't be a poxy white line painted on a road with a few ""caution pedestrians"" signs. The criminal negligence of Irish drivers at pelican crossings makes that unacceptable.

## Paying for it
So how to pay for all of this? Let's start with no new road building. Divert all of those funds to the building of pathways and trails. Look, I hate the roads to Killarney and Limerick as much as you do. And as for Dunkettle! But I'm talking about something a lot more important than a few extra minutes driving.

The removal of the hedgerows will deal with a large number of traffic accidents that happen here when idiots overtake blind on country roads. That's a positive feedback loop that will help pay for itself.

The top causes of death in Ireland are all lifestyle diseases:

1. Coronary heart disease 8%
2. Heart attack 8%
3. Lung cancer 6%
4. COPD	5%

Pull several hundred million out of the health budget that is currently being spent on dealing with preventable lifestyle-related illnesses. Provide cheap runners and step trackers to everyone who is capable of curing themselves, instead of rip-off statins and other heart meds. Carrot and Stick. Or carrot and vape for the smokers.

But there are also revenue oportunities. Figures from Fáilte Ireland show that in 2014, close to 1.2 million visitors to Ireland took part in hiking or cross country walking. These activity tourists spent in the region of €915 million in the Irish economy during their stay. Other stats show that 286,000 visitors took part in cycling activities with a spend of €268 million. These two sectors combined generated revenue for the Irish economy in the region of €1.2 billion in 2014.

And this is in a country that's actively hostile to both walkers and cyclists! 

Imagine how much revenue we could generate if we made their lives easy? All related taxes should be used to pay for the above.


## But, but, but, this is how things have always been
........in your lifetime. A pre-famine landscape looked nothing like it does now. A pre-deforestation landscape looked nothing like it does now.

Any time big changes are suggested I'm reminded of Douglas Adams on technology:

> I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:

> 1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.

> 2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.

> 3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

## Summary
A plan like this addresses health, jobs, tourism, taxes and the environment. Ireland could be leading the way in Europe. Just like we did with fags and bags but with 100x the long term benefit. 

The health crisis in Ireland reminds me a bit of global warming. It happens so gradually that the average person doesn't realise the frog is being boiled. Unlike global warming, it's not too late to deal with this health problem. But it's going to take an incredibly strong will to do so. Sadly, I don't think we have anyone in a position of power in this country capable of making it happen. So the best I'll be able to do is make sure my kids are healthy.

Guest Blogger Review - La Maison Troisgros,"My old friend and classmate from college Dee Burke read my review of The Four Seasons and sent me her review of La Maison Troisgros in France. I asked if she'd mind if I posted it here due to the drooling all over the keyboard that resulted when I read it. She said sure. So, for the first time in the five years this blog has been in existence - a posting from someone other than Mr Creosote:
> Peter had heard of ""La Maison Troisgros"" for the first time when he did a management course in the IMI years ago. The restaurant was used as an example of how customer service should be.

Harness Racing not just for Dublin Skangers,"Two weeks ago I spotted a sign near our house for ""All Ireland Harness Racing"" in Barryroe, about 10 miles down towards the coast. I had missed a lot of the local events in the latter part of the summer, so I figured this might be a bit of fun for us all to check out. 

We headed down with C&T following in their car. Just as we were about to fall into the Atlantic, we turned into a huge field which, according to my map, is very near the townland of Turkeyland. We are still not sure if this is where the guys who built the Ballincollig bypass live or if it is a refuge for abused poultry. 

In any case, we parked the car and proceeded to wade through an un-ending river of cow shit. Now I lived opposite a farm until I was six, so a bit of cow crap doesn't faze me at all. But in my memory, all of the cow-pats were rock hard with flys all over them. This stuff was still steaming. We sprinted across the track to the central visitor area which was a big pleasant surprise. They had an ice-cream van, a chipper, bouncy castles and bookies! Way more professional than I expected.

Since I spent the first few years of my life living near Fairyhouse, I have always enjoyed horse racing and this was no exception. In fact it is far more exciting than your average races. The only thing between you and the horses is a blue rope, the trotting speed is phenomenal and the races are over very quickly. Oisín was rivetted by it and spent his time hanging out of the rope watching the horses bomb past at high speed.

The skill of the jockeys was incredible, particularly a young lad whose debut it was and who could barely have been 12 years old. Watching him control a massive animal at that speed and not come last on his first outing was mightily impressive.

So I think this will be an annual family event for us (if they are actually running it there every year).

Two quick piccies to show the two styles of trotting:

Oh, maybe we were the Dublin skangers......."
Has Flickr always been free?,"I thought it was pay-only the last time I checked. Excellent, I now have a hosting site for any piccies I want to link to. Just looking through the features - bloody hell, I can see why people are raving about it. Can upload pictures via email, so I can send direct from my camera phone to Flickr. Can get it to automatically post the pictures to my blog, so straight from camera phone to blog. I think we'll be dumping the Canon Imagine site pretty soon for the Ixus photos if Flickr proves to be as good as it looks. I'd better check the upload limits I guess."
Have a Small Business and need IT help?,"I know there are tons of small businesses out there struggling with IT, even basics like anti-virus and e-mail. Unfortunately, lack of knowledge can often mean you aren't even aware that there are better and cheaper ways of doing what you are doing.

Last Autumn, the [County Enterprise Boards](http://www.enterpriseboards.ie/) launched [Tech-Check](http://www.techcheck.ie/) to address this widespread problem. It's a simple but highly effective initiative to help businesses sort out their most pressing technology problems.

![](http://www.enterpriseboards.ie/imgs/logo_techcheck.gif)

For €150, you get up to two 3-hour sessions with an IT expert who will go through every aspect of your IT usage and needs. They then come back with a report highlighting your highs and lows and a small set of specific recommendations to improve things.

Disclaimer: I am one of the people used by the Cork CEBs to provide this service.

Unfortunately, the uptake on Tech-Check has not met expectations. I think there are a few reasons for this and I hope I can clarify things a bit.

*   It's not for IT companies, it's for any small business (from 1-50 people) who needs guidance on any aspect of technology whether it's mobile phone usage, internet access, security or even getting a small web-site up for less than €250
*   You are getting far more than €150 worth of consultancy, it is very heavily subsidised and I think the value for money is amazing
*   The CEBs are very sensitive to conflicts of interest and the consultants cannot offer their services to actually implement the suggestions they make
*   The feedback I have received from clients so far has been phenomenal. I've advised everything from one man training businesses and solicitors to multi person sports centres and they have all ended up with better setups and in some cases, saving lots of money.
*   You do not need to know the first thing about IT or technology to apply for a Tech-Check. The less you know, the more help we can provide.
Ignoring the fact that I help provide Tech-Checks, I genuinely think this is the smartest thing to come out of the public service in years. There are thousands of businesses who can benefit and your entire investment can be just €150\. I think you'd be nuts not to sign up, even if you think you don't need it!

Having a WTF moment at the Waterville Trail Running Festival,"## Waterville
To my shame I had never been in Waterville until early 2022 when my Kerry Way Ultra recces began. Despite its remoteness, its position on the Ring of Kerry means it's always busy and buzzing. And as an absolute bonus, all the tourist traffic means that vegans are very well catered for everywhere in the town!

Last year I also learned about the [Waterville Trail Running Festival](https://www.watervilletrailrunningfestival.com/) from Yvonne Walsh and vowed to give it a go this year. The setup for the festival long weekend is fantastic. The core of it is a loop on the extended Kerry Way that's approx 44km long over hills, roads, lanes, beaches and trails. They offer a ~Half Marathon, one loop Marathon, 3 Loop Ultra and 3 Marathon loops over 3 days. So something for most runners.

(Thanks to Seanie and the photographer from [Eat Sleep Trail Run](https://eatsleeptrailrun.com/) for the pic above)

Despite a distinct lack of training and lingering leg problems, I went into the 3 Loop Ultra with high hopes. I had done two solo single loop recces over the Spring and found them very hard but doable. But that was with abominable ground conditions and rain. So I figured a dry April should be a lot easier.

One of the reasons WTF is so cool is that you are up into the trails within a few minutes of the start line. And boy do you get dropped in the deep end. There are really only two difficult off-road bits and the 3 miles up Termon's Ridge is one of them. It's uphill all the way over a mix of fields, bog, rocks and ""trail"". But if you watch your feet, you should be fine.

![Termons](/images/2023/05/termons.png)

## Oh WTF, not now
That's followed by some easy downhill which of course I face-planted on, twisted my ankle and pulled a bunch of things in my right leg. Thanks to Steve for giving me a hand up. Morto and scarleh I was. The course then alternates between gentle off-road and country roads/lanes. 

Did I mention the epic views? They're epic!

## Halfway Paul and Kevin
At the halfway point on the loop, ""Halfway Paul"" takes care of you brilliantly and sends you on your way with a new bounce in your step. On the second loop Paul and Kevin took care of me. I moaned to both of them about the next section and how hard it is. Afterwards I learned that Paul is Paul O’Callaghan who has run across Ireland and has done the Double Wicklow Round! And of course Kevin was Kevin Leahy who has done the 500km Yukon Arctic Race followed a month later by the 500km Lapland Arctic Ultra! And here's Conor whining about a teeny weeny hill that's a bit mucky. 

## The Eagle has face-planted
That teeny weeny hill is Eagle's Hill. It's the worst part of the course. For me it has always been either fog-bound or raining. But in other years I was told it has been stiflingly hot. It's steep, mucky and slippy. But luckily it's not long. The ""mountain pass"" after it is a huge relief and you trot along a lumpy trail for several miles before finally re-joining the main Kerry Way and tripping down into Caherdaniel. And that's all the hard bits done.

![Mountain Pass](/images/2023/05/mountain_pass.png)


Next you jog down the road to Derrynane House, amble along the beach dunes and go on some rocky trail bits on the water's edge. Then it's a couple of miles uphill on a proper road with switchbacks. The views there across the bay have to be some of the best on the planet.

A few small patches of off-road finally get you across The Ring of Kerry and then drop you down near the big carpark at Coomakista. Two easy trail miles that run parallel to the main road bring you to the last section which is another two-ish miles on back lanes and finally you're back in Waterville.

## The Speed Project
The runners and their crews were the only people awake at the start line at 7am. By the time I got back at 2pm, Waterville was mobbed. The loops each have an 8 hour cut-off which is relatively tight for a slowcoach like me. I did the first loop in 7hrs 10mins but had to bust a gut to do that. With the pain from the pulled leg and struggling with the hot day, I suspected I wouldn't make the second cut-off. But my wife sorted me out with food and drinks, restocked my pack and off I headed. 

The second loop was much slower but much more enjoyable as a result. And the reduction in heat as the day progressed was a big help. After rolling my ankle 6 times on the first loop, I finally started paying proper attention and didn't do it once on the second loop.

Eagle's Hill was a mare as the fog had descended. I'm very glad I knew the route and had no issues. The markers were very hard to see and the night hadn't kicked in for the temporary lights on the markers to illuminate. 

## DFL beats DNF, and DNF beats DNS
The welcoming committee in Caherdaniel was an unexpected surprise. As I approached they shouted my name and offered me drinks and snacks. What a wonderful feeling to be given the same reception in last place as the front-runners. 

Oh did I forget to mention that? Yeah, DFL (Dead Fucking Last). Some others had DNFed (Did Not Finish) earlier but I was by far the back-marker of people remaining on the course.

## Derrynane 😍
Dusk was falling when I got to Derrynane Beach and it was even more beautiful than usual.

![Derrynane](/images/2023/05/derrynane.png)

It was a genuine pleasure to be lapped by the first and second place runners after Derryname. Both guys had a chat despite being under pressure. Watching them bound along on loop 3 as I staggered along on loop 2 was another highlight of the day.

## Danger Danger
Then for the scariest bit of the day. Peasoup fog on the trail above Coomakista with serious drops on one side. My headtorch was useless as the fog bounced the light straight back at me. I tip-toed along slowly trying to follow footprints in the mud and was deeply relieved to see the stile at the top of the slope appear out of the gloom. I knew it was downhill on a track after that. 

But it's worth highlighting that off-road always brings the potential for danger and you really do need to keep your wits about you. Two weeks ago I finally did the Coumshingaun Loop in foggy but not peasoup conditions. The whole way around I could only think of poor Gillian Ryan who died running there in 2021. There's one spot in particular where a bad slip could be fatal. I met several 20-somethings coming down the loop in street clothes/shoes and wanted to scream at them. I guess you think you're immortal at that age.

## DFL becomes DNF
I finally made it back to Waterville after 16 hours and 44 minutes. So 44 minutes over the cut-off for loop 2. After a lovely chat with the Race Director Simon, I headed to the resident's bar of the hotel for some much needed pints.

![Finish Line](/images/2023/05/finishline.png)

On the finish line I swore to my wife that I was not doing The Beara Way Ultra in three weeks time. Stay tuned for my blogpost on DNFing the Beara Way Ultra 😀

I also swore to her that I was never coming back to try and get a third loop in time. So when do entries open for 2024? 😀

## Thanks and Watermelon
A huge thanks to the organisers and all the locals and local businesses who support WTF. And a special thank you to the little girl and her grandad who put out water, sweets and fruit for the runners as we approached the end of each loop. It was appreciated on the first loop. It was a life-saver on the second. And watermelon, the absolute legends put out watermelon. Not only is it an amazing thirst quencher, it's now proven to reduce muscle pain after exercise!

## Lessons
The main lesson for me from WTF (and from Beara) was the old line that there is no substitute for miles on feet. I simply haven't been putting the training miles or speed work in day-to-day in 2023. I've been doing big long slow ambles at the weekends but I've gotten out of the habit of the daily grind. Most weeks are barely 20 miles of running. So that all changes now. I'm not repeating my DNF at Kerry Way Ultra, so it's back to basics for the next three months!

## Do it
The number of entrants across all the races in WTF is pretty modest and I really think a ton more people would enter if they realised how doable it is. Particularly the Half and Single Loop Full. You don't have to be some sort of mountain running goat to do WTF - any Half-Marathon road runner would be fine with a basic pair of trail shoes. So if you haven't considered it before, sign up for 2024. It's an amazing part of the country, the organisers are fantastic, there's plenty of accommodation options to suit all budgets and the entry fee is minuscule compared to so many other sports/races. Finally, you'll feel an enormous sense of achievement, no matter what distance you do."
Having some nice rashers for breakfast,"So [47 farms used contaminated pig feed](http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1206/agriculture.html). Unless the FSAI confirms that Gubbeen or Caherbeg are two of those farms, I'll be having a lovely bacon sarnie for my breakfast.

If the State's Chief Medical Officer says that dioxin is only dangerous if a person is exposed to it over a long period of time, then why the hell are we destroying millions of Euro worth of food?

We all eat chicken that spends its life sitting in its own faeces in the dark and lots of the pork we eat is dosed up to the eyeballs in sub-therapeutic antibiotics, so how is a slight possibility of a touch of PCB going to make our health any worse?

Related to this, I've met with a few small food producers recently and I don't know how they stay in business with the nonsensical levels of paperwork and measurement that they have to deal with. Is this actually part of the problem? An unbelievably bloated bureaucracy unable to measure and react quickly because they are drowning in irrelevant form processing? A bit like Sarbanes-Oxley in the US causing people to be so obsessed with process, they forgot about the intent and allowed the banks to trade recklessly for years. 

Finally, I thought we had full meat traceability from field (or concrete pen) to fork? Why not just release the tracking codes of all the individual batches we need to destroy? Or are we all a bit too thick to manage that?

HDClone Hard Drive Copier Review,"<div class='hreview'>   <div>

My Acer 2026 laptop has very few features I don't like. But one thing which has always annoyed me is the 4800 rpm Hard Drive. It really slowed down an otherwise speedy machine. Ages ago I bought a replacement 5400 rpm drive of the same capacity (80GB) from dabs.com. Not being a complete idiot, I also purchased two 2.5"" to 3.5"" disk cable adapters so I could plug both the old and new drives into a spare desktop and clone one to the other.

I have always used Maxtor MaxBlast to do this in the past but this time it had serious problems with the source disk and I never managed to do the cloning.

Recently I saw mention of HDClone on Lifehacker and they recommended it as a free solution to cloning hard drives. Last night I assembled a desktop from spare parts, put the two laptop hard drives in it, burned the HDClone Free Edition to CD and booted it up. All looked well and both disks were visible. But when I asked it to clone, it returned with a message saying that the free version only supports copying to a bigger disk, it would not handle same-sized disks and I would need to upgrade to HDClone Basic. Bum.

I went on to the site and realised it was only €19.90 for the Basic Version. Not much more than the bottle of wine I was drinking. I paid via paypal but was confused as to how I got my hands on the software. I mailed the support address and got a reply at midnight their time (Germany)! The mail with the code would automatically follow later. It was in my inbox this morning. Now that's customer service.

I burned the bootable image to CD and started up the old desktop again. This time, I clicked a few ""nexts"" and off it went. About two hours later it was done. Worryingly it reported 17 read errors off the source disk but no write errors to the new disk. Maybe this is why MaxBlast had such problems before? 

I decided to chance it and plugged the new harddrive into the laptop and all has been well for over an hour (I'm posting this on the laptop). I'll basically try every piece of software installed on the laptop over the next few days to make sure those errrors had no effect. Obviously I still have the original if anything goes wrong.

In summary, an excellent piece of software which only loses one star because it does not provide a list of the locations of the read errors so I could follow them up. Highly recommended if you need to upgrade your hard drive and don't have the time to re-install everything from scratch.

Dear headphone manufacturers - Big opportunity to own the marathon market,"I really wonder about headphone manufacturers and their testing. I own everything from no-name €10 Chinese wired earbuds to €100+ Jaybird X3s and every single one of them is problematic for running.

In the US alone, over 550,000 people ran a marathon in 2016. Scale that globally (with a 13% growth rate) and that's a substantial, defined, receptive, target market.

My goto pair for the past 2 years are [SMS In-Ear Wired Sport](https://smsaudio.com/products/in-ear-wired-sport) earbuds. They were expensive-ish at the time for non-bluetooth but have got me through many marathons. The problems?

* The right-angled jack means I had to buy a straight inline adapter to connect with my phone when it's in a running armband
* Only the play/pause button works on Android
* Being wired means I have a flapping, dangling, awkward cable running from my ears to my arm that I have to control with safety pins.
* Taking the phone off my arm to do anything causes even more cable issues
* Trying to use them when the phone is in a running waist-band is impossible

My second option was a pair of Anker IE20 Bluetooth ""buds"" with connecting wire. The problems?

* Battery life of 2.5 hours means I'd have to be running near Olympic qualifying pace in the marathon
* Connecting cable drags on the back of my neck
* Buds are large due to batteries
* Charging port is hidden if you attach optional (necessary) rubber wings
* Audio drop-out if phone is in a running waist-band

My most recent attempt was a pair of Jaybird X3s. The problems?

* They died after a couple of months just like everyone online said they would. Really Jaybird, really? I'm on day 5 of trying to get an RMA.
* Connecting cable drags on the back of my neck
* Charging connector already unreliable after a few months (and stupid money to replace)
* Some audio drop-out if phone is in a running waist-band

Other options?

* Obviously something like Airpods are a joke for non-Olympic-pace marathon runners. 
* The old Motorola SD10-HD head-grippers give me a headache after a few miles.
* I've read that bone-conduction ones aren't great for audio clarity on podcasts when running but I haven't tried them.
* The Sony SBH20 bluetooth adapter has big audio drop-out issues even with phone on my arm


So what do we marathon runners need?

* Bluetooth to stop the dangling wires and for iPhone users
* 100% waterproof and sweatproof. Not splash-proof or kinda waterproof or even IP68. I mean they can handle being covered by water and sports drinks at 10 waterstops in a marathon, every week.
* A water/sweatproof charging system (See Fenix 3 watch)
* A charging system that's physically tested for at least a few thousand cycles
* Play-time battery life of at least 6 hours
* Rugged as hell. I never want to see a frayed cable
* Ideally no connecting wire between the buds, but if it has one, it needs some way of not tugging on my neck
* Waterproof control buttons. I should be able to press them when covered in sweat
* Wings to keep them in my ears
* €100ish price, ideally less

So build it and start advertising on the big (and small) running sites, along with running podcasts and magazines. Heck, sponsor some marathons.

What about the product name?

""Marathon Headphones - For people who like to run far"". Make them aspirational. Then everyone who runs 5k+ will want to own them.

You'll have a slam dunk of a product."
Heat zaps the bugs and delivers a winning final,"I had written off this series by the third episode but it still showed glimmers of quality. Luckily those glimmers shone through to beat off the bozos and tooth veneers. The final gave us the two best chefs who were clearly passionate and capable.

![](http://www.rte.ie/tv/heat/images/header.jpg ""Heat"")

The food they cooked was fantastic, the mistakes understandable and the emotion strong. My heart was with Ann but I knew in my gut that Paul would clinch it at the end. However I do think she'll be the one to follow her dream and open that cookery school in Italy. Kevin Thornton had obvious affection and admiration for her.

Dare I say it, I'm looking forward to the next series. But please please please, dear production company, use this crazy new fangled thing called the internet to encourage foodies not media whores to apply. There are enough of us foodie bloggers out there to create a buzz and get you applicants who care about food and cooking not 15 minutes of pseudo-fame."

<p>**UPDATE 2007/11/08: A comment below indicates that the restaurant is now under entirely new management etc, so please consider this review out of date.**

My crazy parents decided to babysit all their grandchildren and sent the extended family out for a meal on the August Bank holiday Saturday. We've all had good meals over the years in Heavens Above in Wexford Town but unfortunately, for most of the group, this wasn't one of those times.

The restaurant is above a fabulous old pub with the usual diddley-ay bric a brac on the walls. It is a look that was done to death in Dublin in the 80's and 90's but this feels like it might be real. It is a lovely airy pub with Erdinger on tap, which kept myself and Tony happy. We had booked for 8.30 but had to hang around downstairs until after 9\. Even tho the place never looked completely full all night, the service was incredibly slow overall. OK, we were a group of eight, but that is hardly a stretch for a humming kitchen.

The table seemed to split pretty evenly between fish dishes at one end and steak at the other. Only the steak eaters left happy. The menu semed very limited in scope and unadventurous which was at odds with our previous experiences. I heard later that the chef who made the place famous had been poached by Forde's along with a lot of the other staff (more of that in the next review). You could tell.

I enjoyed my toulouse sausage on lentils but Kevin thought it was bland and to be honest I could have rustled it up in 10 minutes at home with my eyes closed.

The fillet steaks with cafe de paris sauce were excellent and cooked just right.

 The various types of fish that were ordered were all rated as very disappointing with a general feel that everything was missing simple touches like some butter or cream in the mashed spuds.

Desserts were skipped but the coffee was fine. The bill came to €380 with an automatic service charge of 10% due to the table size and we did not top that up. This included several pints for six of the diners and one bottle of white. Usual story with me - if it was far cheaper, I wouldn't complain too much as the meal was fine. But at that price level, you can get far better food in other places in the town.

&lt;a href= http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/213090429/  title= Photo Sharing &gt;&lt;img src= http://static.flickr.com/83/213090429_03f37236c4_m.jpg  width= 240  height= 180  alt= Heaven's Above Meal 1  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desserts were skipped but the coffee was fine. The bill came to €380 with an automatic service charge of 10% due to the table size and we did not top that up. This included several pints for six of the diners and one bottle of white. Usual story with me - if it was far cheaper, I wouldn't complain too much as the meal was fine. But at that price level, you can get far better food in other places in the town.&lt;/p&gt;

Heists for Jesus,"I shouldn't laugh, I really shouldn't, but I'm pretty sure the only Baptist church in Bandon is the one just near our house.

If only we'd gone to his coffee morning, this could all have been avoided.

The fact that the BOI Bank Manager lives beside the Baptist Church too sends this story into the realms of the completely bizarre.

So long WordPress. Hello Hexo.,"I've been blogging longer than the average bear, with my first post wayyyy back in 2001 on Blogger. I moved to WordPress in 2005 and did a huge amount of stuff with it both personally and professionally until 2013. 

But, like many people, I've had it with WordPress. Pretty much every WP blog I either ran or had some dealings with, has been hacked. Whether through security-hole-riddled plugins, xmlrpc.php or other bugs in WP. I just don't have the time to constantly update eveything and hope it's alright. The botnets relentlessly trying to login to all of the blogs and managing to mini-DDoS me on a regular basis are just the pooh on the cake.

So over the past 2 years I've moved most of my blogs and sites to static setups. Good old HTML, CSS and JS without a whiff of PHP or MySQL. This has been a huge success for me and I simply don't have to worry about any of those sites. I've popped the images up on S3 for performance too.

My tool of choice for all of this has been [Harp](http://harpjs.com/) and I've been happy with it apart from the very long generation time with each new post on [conoroneill.net](http://conoroneill.net). Basically it re-generates the entire site for every new post/page. And with close to 1000 posts there, that takes 5+ minutes even on an 8-core machine (presumably because it's doing them all sequentially).

So when it came time to kill my last install of WordPress here on conoroneill.com, I decided to see what else was out there in the ""Node.js Static Site Generation Tool"" world. And I quickly found [Hexo](http://hexo.io/).

![Hexo](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hexo.png)

Hexo is a fairly new static blogging platform from Taiwan that seems to have built a community very quickly. It is very easy to use/setup and has import tools for the usual suspects including WordPress. The latter had a one-line bug which I fixed and they have merged already. Getting all of the old posts from WordPress involved taking the export file from WP and running it through the Hexo migration tool a few times and making some fixes. It found a few problems like dodgy markup from old WP plugins and a crazy number of categories/tags. A bit ot search/replace fixing in Notepad++ sorted that out and I got a clean import working with very little effort.

I love how quickly it generates static pages and the general ease of use and configuration but obviously you have to be comfortable using Command Line tools and editing Markdown if you want to use it. However, if you are sick of the WP treadmill, it may be a solution for you too."

"Hey Dad, that's the same ugly fish as last week","I have a wee bee in my bonnet about how difficult it is to get good fresh fish in the ""greater Bandon area"". When we moved down here, I thought I would have fish coming out of my ears (as opposed to sleeping with the fishes). But it was the complete opposite. 

The SuperValu in the town has a small fish counter but you can never rely on it to have anything you want. And in the spirit of old Ireland, there are two fish stalls every friday up near the top of town. Whilst this is a lovely tradition and long may it continue, I do tend to want fish other than on the same day every week. The two vendors also only sell the usual staples like cod etc.

I got excited one day when I spotted a van with a sign saying ""The Bandon Fish Shop"". And where do they turn out to be based? The English Market in Cork City! I think they live in Bandon, hence the name......

Of course the English Market is heaven for all sorts of food, particularly fish. If you visit the city and don't check out O'Connell's fish stall, you are missing something very special. These guys have everything. They have a counter which has a constant running stream of water on it and they gut and fillet at high speed on demand. Not quite the high jinks of those guys in the Market in Seattle who throw the huge fish at each other but still pretty bloody impressive.

There are only two problems with the English Market  - it is a 40 minute drive and the only day I can go is Saturday when it is mayhem from about 10am onwards. Ideally I want to use the double buggy to cart around the two younger ones whilst I have Ois&iacute;n in a head lock to stop him running away but the aisles are just too narrow and there are too many people to make it a pleasurable experience.

I spent a day last year touring villages near the sea trying to find one.  Clon is on the bloody sea and they don't have a fish shop - the fish counter in Dunnes is a joke. Nothing in Kilbrittain, nothing in Timoleague. But I did spot a sign for [Ummera Smoked Salmon](http://www.ummera.com/) and headed in that direction, thinking I was being very cunning as they would surely know where to get fish in the area.

We drove up a rutted track to find a fabulous wooden building which unfortunately looked closed but a van arrived just after us and it was the owner, Anthony Creswell. I spent about twenty minutes having a really good chat. He is an interesting, friendly and funny guy. The Smokery is just so cool; It is totally environmentally friendly and uses a reed-bed system for filtering its waste. If you get a chance, try their salmon, it is fantastic. They are part of 
[Irish Smoked Wild Atlantic Salmon Presidium of The Slow Food movement,](http://www.slowfoodireland.com/what-we-do-page4388.html) along with Marky Mark's Da's company, [Dunn's of Dublin](http://www.dunns.ie/home.htm) (which is also fabulous and a lot easier to get than Ummera). But the unbelievable thing was that he had no idea either where we would get fresh fish other than heading down to the ports. 

I gave up for a long time except for the odd foray to the English Market. Then a few months back there was rake of ads for Fish shops down in West Cork. [Union Hall Fish Sales](http://www.unionhallfishsales.com/) advertised that they now had a place in Skibbereen and then [Antcar ](http://www.antcarfish.ie/)advertised that they had a shop in Union Hall which is a major fishing port.

Two weeks ago I headed to Skibb. On the way we passed through Leap (pronounced Lep or Leep?). Fab Lake/Estuary/Sea/Bit of water as you leave the village. I toured Skibb and failed miserably to find the Union Hall shop, but I did find ""The Baltimore Fish Shop"". I had the three younger squirts in the car so I bundled two of em into the buggy and Ois&iacute;n pushed. The shop was quite small and pokey with a very small selection of fish. But Ois was enthralled. ""What's that ugly one called Dad"", ""Monkfish, Ois"". What about that long one ""Cod, Ois"". 

So I got some plaice, tuna and smoked haddock. I wondered about overall freshness as the place wasn't exactly hopping but when I took the fish out later to cook, there was only the smell of the sea so it was top quality. All of it was lovely. Fishcakes for the kiddies, fried plaice for us and then tuna with spaghetti and tomato sauce for the squirts the following day.

So of course I had to go one better and the following weekend headed down to Union Hall to check out Antcar. This is one of the best drives you can do in the country. There is the lovely view of Rosscarbery Lagoon just before you turn towards Glandore. And then Glandore, dear god Glandore. My C in Honours English in the Leaving means I lack the descriptive skills to give you any sense of the views as you drive through and past Glandore. I can see why lots of ""stars"" have houses there. Jaw-droppingly fabulous sea vistas. Easily as impressive as the Grand Canyon. 

After Glandore is one of the coolest bridges in the country. It is a small metal pokey thing and it is one car wide apart from a bulge in the middle to allow those playing chicken to pass each other. I would love to have been at the meeting where they decided the design of the bridge. ""I call to order the monthly meeting of the Ballymagash Town Council. The first order of business is the planned bridge joining Union Hall to Glandore"". ""We have &pound;1000 available to build it, how much will it cost?"". ""&pound;2000"". ""Bugger, anyone got any ideas?"". ""How's about half a bridge?"". ""What, they swim the rest of it?"". ""No, half a bridge, one donkey cart wide"". ""Genius, motion passed, build it"". That is lateral thinking at its very finest.

And so onwards to Antcar. Absolutely brilliant. It is a small shop fronting their wholesale business and was hopping at 11.30 on a saturday morning. Shibs and Fionn were buggy-bound and not that interested. Ois had eyes bulging out of his head when he spotted the massive lobsters in the tank. And then, ""Hey Dad, that's the same ugly fish as last week"". You're spot on Ois, it's another monkfish. Poor lad nearly jumped out of his skin when the crab beside it made a move. The guy behind the counter was extremely friendly, helpful and did a great job on gutting and filletting. 

On the way back I popped into [The Lettercollum Kitchen Project ](http://www.lettercollum.ie/) in Clon which is half food shop (mainly organic) and half pre-prepared food for foodies who hate cooking. They do fantastic quiches, salads, tarts and a bunch of other things. The shop half has lots of things made from spelt (what the hell is spelt?) and good value in spices and other ingredients. I splurged. I also got a big bar of Green & Black Caramel chocolate and broke the diet badly for one lip-smacking day.
We had a weekend of gurnard, haddock, a fab Gigot de Lotte (Monkfish roasted with garlic and rosemary) and calamari.

And then onto the final chapter in my slightly obsessive adventure. Last weekend, I tried to find the Union Hall Fish Sales place again in Skibb and this time I succeeded. They are just on the road out to Bunalun. So I guess Bunalun Organic Products is not an invented name after all? The Co-Op is another smallish shop fronting a wholesale business. The selection was not great at all but the fish looked good. One thing I had noticed in Antcar was a complete lack of molluscs and it was the same here so I asked why. He just said it wasn't part of their business. Maybe this part of Cork doesn't land much in the way of mussels or scallops? I think it is the right time of year for them. I got some sole and frozen scallops and then asked him about the John Dory. I wanted to know if it was best to cook them whole or get him to fillet them. ""Dunno mate, don't eat the stuff"". Jesus! What is his weekday job? Vegetarian in a butchers? So I got him to fillet them cos they looked awkward to do. 

On the way back this time I went to the Organic Shop on the same street as Lettercollum. Pick a random name from the 1916 boyos and they are both on that street. This is a branch of the one in the English Market. They seem to have re-focused since Lettercollum opened and now do a lot of fresh veg and food rather than the dried goods. It's also an excellent shop but the prices are pretty steep. In any case, the sole was lovely but idiot-boy forgot he was going to Boston for the week so the rest of it was frozen until I get a chance to eat it.

So top tip for eating fish in Cork: Move to Union Hall.

Update 1: Finally went to Scally's Supervalu in Clon. Fish not bad. but even better - they do bacon from [Gubbeen](http://www.gubbeen.com/) in Schull. I'll be back.

Hoka Speedgoat 4 - The perfect trail running shoe?,"I've been having mixed success with trail runners in 2021 which you can read about in previous mini-reviews:

* [Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX](https://conoroneill.com/2021/04/18/the-sheeps-head-way-ambling-51-miles-in-21-hours/) - Love the comfort and waterproofedness. Great for road-to-trail. Did 50-60 mile Sheeps's Head Way twice in them. But very little grip in the wet. 
* [Saucony Peregrine 10](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/review-of-saucony-peregrine-10-11/) - Killed my heel. Unwearable. Great grip.
* [Inov-8 TrailFly Ultra G 300 Max](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/review-of-inov-8-trailfly-ultra-g-300-max/) - Heavy, blister-inducing on rough ground, lethal on wet rocks. Great bounce. Will keep using for easy terrain and hiking.

So when I finally signed-up for the [Kerry Way Ultra Lite](http://www.kerrywayultra.com/kerry-way-ultralite.php) after many years of ""I must I must"" (blog post coming very soon!) I started getting stressed about my footwear. I'd used the above (and others) on various coourse recces over an extended period and nothing felt right.

I've avoided the Speedgoat for as long as I've run offroad because every review said they were narrow. Whilst I don't have particularly wide feet, my poor smallest toes get destroyed over marathon+ distances so I avoid anything that is specifically called narrow.

But when I thought about how much I loved the ATR apart from the grip, it seemed like an obvious choice with the Vibram Megagrip. I also really enjoyed the Evo Mafate around 2019 apart from the stiffness and them falling apart.

Weirdly this orange colourway was temporarily much cheaper than the others on [Alltricks](https://www.alltricks.com/Buy/hoka+speedgoat+4) so I went for it. My usual size was correct.

![Hoka Speedgoat 4](/images/2021/09/speedgoat4.jpg)

I've done three runs in them. The first was a short one on mixed surface which felt great and the second was on a ten mile recce of the KWU Lite from the start of the Old Kenmare Rd at the Kenmare end towards Killarney. That's all off-road but not really technical at all. They were absolutely perfect on this. Comfortable, grippy, good on wet surfaces, great on the downhills. And not too narrow! So I'm not sure where that reputation comes from.

The third run was the Kerry Way Ultra Lite itself two weeks ago. And they rocked! I had many problems on the day but none of them related to my feet. In recent years I've taken to taping up most/all of my toes on very long runs. And more recently on my [Sheep's Head Way FKT](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/), I taped my forefeet too, with Leukotape P. I did this for KWU and had zero blisters. Yes zero! That's over 58km of all sorts of terrain including roads.

![Feet](/images/2021/09/toes.jpg)

The cushion was incredible on the day. The wet grip wasn't needed much due to a dry week and I had no grip issues on the rocky bits. Not a single slip. And more impressively for such a high stack, not a single ankle roll. I had a couple of forward stumbles but that was down to my legs getting tired and me not lifting enough.

I was genuinely shocked at how well they worked and how great I felt at the end of the race. Sure I'm going to lose 4 toenails but that's unavoidable with hammering downhill.

I have [Ecotrail Wicklow 46K](https://wicklow.ecotrail.com/fr/course-ecotrail-wicklow/46k) this weekend and will update this post if I have anything new to report about them.

But honestly, this is what I'll be running in offroad for the foreseeable future. Unless they release V5 :-)

UPDATE: I'm just back from doing the Ecotrail Wicklow 46K and the Speedgoats were amazing again. I had a very rough day with my right calf completely cramped from mile 6 onwards but I didn't have a moment's issue with the shoes. They handled every surface perfectly and were ridiculously comfortable. I had one minor skid on a steep downhill on loose gravel which no shoe would have been able to prevent, but that's it. And yet again, no blisters. This time I only taped my toes. So I'm sticking with ""the perfect trail running shoe"" description."
Hot Desking Office Space in Bantry,"It has always struck me as ridiculous that the only place in all of West Cork where you can get a short-term Hot-Desk is in [Macroom](http://www.macroom-e.com/). We're not that far from it but it's still a horrible drive from Bandon.

We continue to struggle as a small Internet business with 6 Mbs ADSL (512kbs up). If we were slightly closer to the exchange we might get 12Mbs. Those responsible for allowing Fibre connectivity to bypass Bandon have ensured that there will never be a technology cluster in the town. It was a catastrophic oversight and will damage the town for years to come. No business requiring serious levels of bandwidth can set themselves up here.

But even with Fibre in Clon, there are no Hot-Desks in the Technology Park. If you go looking for small business offices in West Cork you either find something over  a shop or you can have an entire building.

So I was thrilled to see that Bantry now has Hot-Desking in Bantry Enterprise Centre, supported by [WCEB](http://www.wceb.ie/). You can rent by the month and get:

*   Individual desk area – fully serviced and partitioned
*   Access to broadband
*   Direct dial telephone number
*   Access to canteen facilities and Meeting Room
*   Generous car parking
*   Linkages to support bodies for start-up assistance
I really welcome this but there are a few small issues:

*   Pricing is ""on application"". This should be public and on a web-site somewhere
*   No mention of what type of Broadband. It needs to be a lot more than ADSL
*   It'd be better if weekly options were available too (and even drop-in daily rates)
Enquiries/Expressions of Interest should be forwarded to:

I'm going to contact them now about pricing/broadband and will update when I hear back. Obviously it is too far for me to go regularly but if it's a success, maybe WCEB could look at some of the empty buildings with Fibre in Clon? I'd be down like a shot if they did.

Hot Hot Hot Hot Sauces,"The offer of a free box of these sauces was irresistable and we have spent the past few months trying them in a variety of different ways. Whilst our weak-willed Irish palates found the hotter ones just too hot, the depth of flavour is just fantastic. If only they had an Irish distributor!

Back in January I got a comment on [a very old post](http://conoroneill.com/2006/03/31/buffalo-wings-mmm-tasty-but-not-so-hot/) from 2006 that I did about buffalo wings. I had used the famous Frank's Hot Sauce and mentioned that I was a little disappointed by it. Mark Stirling from [Branding Iron Foods](http://www.brandingironfoods.com/) offered to ship me a box of their sauces all the way from Washington State to try out. I was stunned and of course I accepted.

In no time at all, a box arrived with nine big bottles in it. Three each of EZ Earl's Blazin Hot Stuff, Smokin Hot Stuff and Spicy Sauces. Mark told me that they have been refining the recipe in these sauces for generations. I couldn't wait to try them out and immediately tried the hottest (Blazin) on a tray of chicken pieces in the oven. It blew my face off. Seriously, this makes vindaloo curry taste like a korma!

[![Chicken Pieces with EZ Earl Blazin Hot Stuff](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2654526137_35dffe7bfa.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2654526137/ ""Chicken Pieces with EZ Earl Blazin Hot Stuff by bandon1, on Flickr"")

Over the next while we tried out all three levels of heat both at home and on some of my extended family. It turns out we are all a bunch of big girl's blouses and the lowest heat (Spicy) is our favourite. All three work brilliantly well on buffalo wings but the hottest is just too hot for us in things like pitta kebabs.

But heat shouldn't be the main focus of this review, it should be taste. These sauces deliver that in bucketloads. There is a phenomenal depth of flavour that far exceeds anything I have tried before. In particular, the Spicy one gives you the opportunity to really get the notes of all the ingredients.

![](http://www.brandingironfoods.com/images/Blazin-Hot%20Stuff2.jpg)

All of the sauces have smoke in them which I guess is traditional in the US? This is perfect for all those BBQ sutuations but I'd love one more member of the product family to be created without the smoke so it can be used in an even wider variety of situations where you need to add a strong spicy undertone to a dish.

Whilst using the sauce instead of Tabasco in a Prawn Cocktail might seem a bit odd, trust me, it works so so well. I actually find myself looking for unusual ways of using the sauce, it really is that good.

My gut tells me that the hottest level would not sell in Ireland and that the best seller would actually be the Spicy. But I do think it would be a best seller. If any Deli or Gourmet shop here is looking for unique products to import, you really should look at these. I'd be happy to put you in touch with Mark.

Now all we need is some decent weather so I can get some BBQ done!

UPDATE 1: The first ever [OpenCoffeeClub BBQ](http://opencoffeeclub-bbq.com/) was held in Terryglass, Co Tipperary on the shores of Lough Derg recently. I decided to test out the Blazin and Smokin sauces on the attendees. I got a few kilos of wings, some bone-in chicken breasts and some massive pork chops from the excellent Dan Moloney's butchers in Bandon. I put each of them in ziplock bags and emptied bottles of the hottest sauce on the chicken and the less hot on the chops. They went in the fridge overnight and then were transported in a cooler box to the BBQ.

Due to the bad state of the grill near the venue, the food was actually cooked in some ovens. But boy were they popular! People descended on them like ravenous wolves. The feedback was all positive and contradicted what I said earlier about heat, no-one found them too hot, they thought they were perfect! Marinating them and then dry roasting them seemed to have mellowed the heat compared to wet cooking. The depth of smokey flavour came right through. Very memorable wings."

How Flahavan's Oat Milk can out-market the big brands,"I was so pleased when I heard Flahavan's was getting into the oat milk market. As the most famous porridge brand in Ireland, it seemed like an obvious move.

![Flahavan's Oat Milk](/images/2021/10/flahavans-oat-barista-drink-1.jpg)

I only turned plant-based in January 2020 and switched to oat milk pretty quickly as I preferred, and still prefer, its taste to all the other plant milks. Having Flahavans as an option along with the usual Oatly, Califia, Minor Figures and Alpro means I can now finally support Irish farmers again with my cuppa tea and coffee.

Obviously Flahavans don't have the marketing budgets of the others which you can see by its lowly position on the supermarket shelves as they can't do the same level of kickbacks that global CPG firms can. What, you thought they put the *best* products at eye level?

So they'll need to do some dodging and weaving to grow their market presence here and then do a Baileys on it into the UK and US. I think the bright busy branding on the cartons helps for a start.

Here are my couple of ideas, coming from someone in the target demographic, not as someone who knows anything about the food industry.

## Motorway Services
Despite Irish garages coming on in leaps and bounds since the advent of breakfast-roll guy, they still have some huge gaps in their offerings, particularly for vegans, veggies and anyone with an intolerance to frytex :-) 

Whilst things are generally good in the food courts of the big motorway services during the day, it's a complete catastrophe before 9am and after about 6pm. I have yet to find one on the M7/M8 that does plant-based milk when there isn't a barrista on duty. And it's even worse for food - try getting a vegan sandwich or similar when Subway, Chopped and Zambrero are closed. And forget McDonalds completely until the McPlant arrives in 2022.

As a step 1, could Flahavans provide oat-milk and branded insulated metal jugs for free to all the garages on the M7/M8/M9/N25 as a trial? So there would be no coffee/tea machine changes needed. It just becomes another option along with the low-fat ones some of them offer in jugs. There'll already be massive brand recognition in general because of porridge.

Because of the dire plant-milk situation outside of big cities in Ireland, I've taken to bringing full tetra-packs of oat milk with me to hotels. I also have some much smaller soy and oat cream ones in my car, which are unfortunataly too large for single-use and are cream not milk. They work for when I've done a long off-road run and know I'll be pulling in to a rural garage/cafe/horse-box.

I've done some googling on miniature oat-milks but only managed [to find one](https://www.organicdenmark.com/naturli-oat-drink-20-ml). It's Danish and they brilliantly have done it with the old 1970s UHT triangular packaging. Flashbacks to the campsite shop in Barleycove as a kid.

![Naturli Oat Milk](/images/2021/10/naturli-oat-drink-20-ml.png)

Think of all the hotels around the country with the crappy UHT milk miniatures or the Lakelands plastic tubes of milk. If the hotels were all convinced to provide artificial sweetener years ago, then oat milk miniatures should be a no-brainer. 

From an environmental perspective, I'm not sure if anything biodegradeable is available but that would obviously be preferable.

## Planes, trains and automobiles
Please also sell these as multi-packs in supermarkets so I can bring them on planes too. Oooh planes!!!! Calling Ryanair and Aer Lingus.

## And that's it
Option 1 requires no changes to anything you are doing in production apart from ordering some branded flasks. Option 2 is obviously a bigger ask but feels like a gigantic opportunity.

You'd have me as a customer for life if you followed through."
How not to get my vote,"I cannot understand why Christy O'Sullivan thinks he'll get a vote from me. Here is a guy shoe-horned in by FF at a national level who sends me flyers with absolutely no information on them about who he is, what he believes in, where he lives, what he has accomplished as a politician or why I should vote for him. 

And of course his website doesn't load!

Inserting this nobody over a well known local politician like Alan Coleman is a huge mistake by FF. I don't know how well Coleman would have done in this climate but at least he has a known reputation.

I will not vote for anonymous candidates from any party."
How not to waste an hour,"We've just had the third annual waste of time known as Earth Hour where millions of people worldwide pretend to do something useful about global warming and turn off lights for an hour. For 99.999999% of those people, that'll be it for another 365 days. End result for the Earth, big fat zero. Perhaps if we take all the energy expended by the media covering this story, we may even have a net negative?

![chamberlain2](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/chamberlain2.jpg ""chamberlain2"")

Imagine if, instead, those millions of people went outside, dug up a square metre or two of their perfect lawns and planted some vegetable seeds? Or if they lived in an apartment in Ireland, they contacted [Irish Allotments](http://www.irishallotments.net/) about organising patches in their locality?

![digforvicspade](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/digforvicspade-200x300.jpg ""digforvicspade"")

Then instead of some silly hour-long nonsense they could:

*   Reduce CO2 throught the action of the plants
*   Reduce petrol consumption through less shopping
*   Reduce fuel miles by not buying foreign vegetables
*   Save money
*   Get their kids outside
*   Take part in [Seed Saver](http://www.irishseedsavers.ie/) schemes
*   Eat healthier
*   Get fit
We could call it Gardener's World :-)

Of course taking care of this veg patch takes a wee bit longer than one hour a year and isn't news-worthy so maybe we should just turn off the lights and keep playing mushroom instead."
How Pirate Bay could be the next News Corp,"Those of us who are watching much less broadcast TV and more time-shifted or downloaded programmes are starting to become very uncomfortable with the monthly Sky tax just to get some intermittent BBC2/Ch4 etc.

Media companies everywhere try to stop piracy and block those outside of their borders from watching programming online on sites like Hulu. This is a battle they cannot win.

The problem they have at the moment is licensing. If broadcast rights to House MD are sold to Channel 6 in Ireland then the licensor cannot allow Irish people to watch the same media for free (and Irish-ad free) on Hulu or similar as they'd be subverting their own customers.

There are thousands of production companies, studios, TV stations and distribution companies involved in this mess. The thought that one company could do all the deals necessary to create a global on-demand PAYG online site for all media to be downloaded seems an almost impossible dream.

Unless we start offering them money.

What if Pirate Bay (or Mininova or Isohunt) provided a scheme whereby every time someone downloads an episode of House or Celebrity Apprentice or Top Chef etc, they are given the option of paying 50c? Once a month, they tot up the totals for each show, cut some cheques and send them to the production companies to carve up however they see fit with their partners/customers.

There would be no deals here, no agreements, no pricing arrangements, no permission sought or given. They'd just get the cheque in the post.

At what point would all of the players be getting sufficient income from this source that they are forced to join the 21st Century and realise that this is one global market and media should go to those who want it, when they want it.

Just an idea."
How safe are your pictures and documents?,"I'm sure you bought a USB stick or portable harddisk with the best intentions in the world but how often do you actually backup irreplaceable files? How would you feel if those wedding pictures disappeared in a puff of smoke?

That's why I consider online backup a must-have. I only recommend two services and the one at the top of my list is [PutPlace](http://www.putplace.com/). This low-cost solution by an Irish company is simple to set-up and then you just forget about it. All of your important files are kept safe on Amazon's amazing storage system S3 and you can recover what you need with a few clicks.

![](http://putplace.com/files/putplace_logo.gif ""PutPlace"")

The important thing about PutPlace is that it for consumers. So whilst [HP gives up and shutters Upline](http://blog.putplace.com/2009/02/26/putplace-invites-hp-upline-users-to-switch/), PutPlace goes from strength to strength.

Backup is boring but the day you lose those files is the day you wish you'd signed up for [PutPlace](http://www.putplace.com/).  My buddy Joe, the founder, will even give you 3 months free. Just use the discount code ""joe""!"
How to avoid the Irish pharmacy gouge by buying from drugstore.com,"For the past few years I have been buying a variety of pharmacy products from [drugstore.com](http://drugstore.com) in the US. Don't worry, they're part of Amazon, not some dodgy crowd flogging fake horse tranquillizers.

There are two reasons I've been doing this. The first is that I use a miracle stomach drug called [Omeprazole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omeprazole) which solved over 20 years of chronic stomach problems when I finally discovered it (and other PPIs like Nexium). Getting the branded versions via prescription here would cost an arm and a leg but it is available as a non-prescription (i.e. OTC) generic in the US.

The second is the criminal difference between the cost in Ireland of normal NSAIDs like paracetemol/ibuprofen and the cost in the US. How about 500 ibuprofen for $12.99 or 500 paracetemol (acetaminophen) for $11.99? Compared to maybe €2 for 24 generic paracetemol here? Also, it's 500, not some idiotic packet of 12 that Micheál Martin forced on us during his reign.

Whilst the products were cheap, the shipping and customs really added up so we would buy 6-9 months worth of products at a time and made big savings. Unfortunately drugstore.com decided to stop doing direct international shipping a few months ago which had me very worried. However they did say they were happy to use a third party shipping agency in the US. They recommended one but I decided to go with [US Unlocked](http://www.usunlocked.com/), with whom I already had an account.

US Unlocked is a great service. I signed up with them to get an online US Credit Card to buys things like Amazon VOD TV shows etc but their core business is providing people with US shipping addresses. The idea is that you have a unique address with them in New Jersey and when you order, you provide that address to the vendor. You can order from multiple vendors and wait until everything arrives there. They notify you of each arrival. Once you are ready, you tell them what you want shipped and they quote you a price via UPS. You pay the fee (normal credit card, PayPal etc) and they ship. Simple.

I did an order recently with drugstore.com and another from [Florian Tools](http://store.floriantools.net/florian-ratchet-cut-pruning-tools/hand-pruners/breast-cancer-benefit-ratchet-pruner-with-holster) who make a superb ratchet pruners that my mother loves. Florian used to have very cheap shipping to Ireland but when I checked recently, the shipping cost more than the product! This is a common issue in the US.

For this order, US Unlocked quoted me $67 to send a few hundred dollars worth of stuff, which I thought was very reasonable. No other fees were involved and all the US-based drugstore.com deliveries were free. It took a week to arrive due to some weird hold-up with UPS in Germany but everything arrived perfectly today.

Note that you may incur customs charges depending on the products, so factor that into your spend. I'd recommend doing a big family order twice a year and share the shipping cost across the family.

I'm really thrilled how well it worked out. Big thumbs up for both [drugstore.com](http://drugstore.com) and [US Unlocked](http://www.usunlocked.com/).

How to feel just a bit stupid,"I'm very technical, I can figure most things out given sufficient time, but sometimes I just don't get it. Take for example my recent purchase of a Nokia N770 Internet Tablet.

It is a fabulous piece of kit at an incredible knock-down price of €107 plus VAT and P&P. I believe it was over €400 when it was released. It's basically a little hand-held computer with a touch screen that works over Wifi or your mobile connection (via bluetooth). I've totally got the hang of it and use it every day.

Except it came with this:

And I just couldn't figure it out. I decided it was part of a stand of some sort but appeared to be missing the other parts.

How to find about problems like the water situation in Bandon,"We lost water around 2am Saturday and it returned dark brown at around 2pm. Does anyone know what the back story is and whether the water is safe to drink?

I would encourage Cork CoCo to immediately fire the arsehole at the end of the ""All other emergencies"" phone line listed in the Green Pages. My wife rang this cretin at 6am to report the water problem and find out what was wrong. She had already tried and failed to get through to the local engineers office. The bozo claimed that the number was only for reporting road problems. When asked for an alternative number he said she should check the Green Pages! No amount of arguing could convince this criminal waste of taxpayers money that she had rung the relevant listed number.

I headed to SuperValu to get bottled water at approx 11am to discover it was not just Old Chapel but all of Bandon that was out. Given that the incompetent fool at the end of the phone line is the only way we have of finding out the status of a problem like this, how does Cork CoCo propose to keep residents informed of problems, resolutions and warnings? 

Maybe someone should tell them about this amazing new system called d'internet. If small Pacific Islands can set up web based warning systems for tsunamis, is it beyond the wit of Cork CoCo to have similar here? Of course they'd probably put the professionally negligent buffoon who mans the phone line in charge of it.

In the interim I am looking into putting together a very simple problem reporting and viewing system using something like Twitter or Jaiku. You would be able to send problems/resolutions using a web browser, SMS or Instant Message. e.g. broken water mains, ESB failures, car crashes etc."
How to follow the #CSW #GE11 Election Results/Buzz,"This is for people interested in Cork South West election coverage/results.

Love it or hate it, if you want absolutely up-to-date information on the General Election over the next few days then you have to be on Twitter. Don't worry, for most of it you don't have to setup an account.

So the main feeds you'll probably be interested in are:

*   [#GE11](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23ge11) - This will be a firehose and only for total politics junkies. A huge percentage of Tweets about the election by everyone on Twitter will have this tag
*   [#CSW](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23csw) - This is much quieter and is specifically for Cork South West Tweets
*   [@RTEcorkSTHWEST](http://twitter.com/#!/RTEcorkSTHWEST) - This is for RTE's coverage of the count in Cork South West
*   [@RTE_Elections](http://twitter.com/#!/RTE_Elections) - Despite my many criticisms of RTE, this has been a brilliant feed of general election coverage
*   [General Election Candidates](http://twitter.com/#!/suzybie/candidates-ge11-3) - This is [Suzy Byrne's](http://www.mamanpoulet.com/) list of 265 General Election Candidates accounts.
*   [General Election 2011](http://twitter.com/#!/conoro/general-election-2011) - A small list I created of people/accounts talking about the election
And finally, my little geeky project over at [CurationByMe](http://curationby.me). It allows you to pop in a List like Suzy's and then filter it by a tag. So you can see just #ge11 related tweets by everyone in a specific list, not everything they are saying. Unlike all of the other above, you do need a Twitter account to use it.

Any other hashtags, accounts or lists that people can recommend for Cork South West coverage? Radio stations, newspapers etc?

How Your Kids Can Re-Build The Country - Cork Coder Dojo,"Ireland has more than enough Corporate Lawyers, Audit Accountants, Bankers and Civil Servants. What it needs are creative people building products, services and businesses. That doesn't necessarily mean every kid in Ireland should be doing Science or Engineering but lord, would more of you please do those subjects.

The internet is one place where we see a wonderful synthesis of creativity in design and engineering. I believe you can teach anyone the basics of web development to a level where they can contribute in some way to web applications and mobile applications. Some of the greatest web-apps were built by self-taught people, not Computer Science graduates.

The key, again, is the word ""creativity"". We need to take back ownership of that word from those we would traditionally call ""the creatives""; artists, sculptors, authors and actors. Just look at something like Facebook and think about all of the people involved in the creation of that. Creative coders, user interface designers, product managers and Ops people all working together to build an amazing system which impacts 700 million people in a positive way.

Yesterday I attended an event which may be one of the most important initiatives ever in changing the mind-set of Irish parents. [Cork Coder Dojo](http://codrcamp.com/) was put together by [James Whelton](http://twitter.com/jwhelton) and [Bill Liao](http://twitter.com/liaonet). You probably know that Bill is a serial entrepreneur but you may not know James. He just finished his Leaving Cert.

The Coder Dojo is a weekly meetup where young people can learn the basics of web development and build sites/apps with the help of the volunteers there. Yesterday was the first one and it felt to me like I was taking part in the beginning of something huge. The room in the NSC was jammed with kids of all ages and their parents. James gave a basic intro to some simple HTML and then he and others went around to help.

I was there with our 12 y/o who has just finished primary school. He is a geek but not a coder. We have built Google AppInventor mobile apps but he has never seen HTML. Within 20 minutes, he ""got it"". We had fun embedding images and videos and changing colours. We also did some basic styling with CSS. The next step is to look at JavaScript and JQuery to make a site that does something.

The reason I feel James and Bill are on to something is that I could see many of the parents were not remotely technical. This is not geek parents turning their kids into programmers (well, except for me maybe :-)), this is smart parents understanding that their kids can re-build this country with their creativity and the right skill-sets. I was pleased to see that Simon Coveney popped in too.

Whilst I know that many secondary schools teach some basic web skills to kids, I think it has to start earlier and be driven by people who build Apps themselves. I see no reason why my 9 y/o or even 7 y/o could not learn simple development. They may never use it, but they will always have an appreciation for it. Maybe in some ways not that different to sending your kids to piano lessons.

The intention is that The Coder Dojo will be on every Saturday. I strongly recommend that you bring your children to at least one. Don't worry if you don't have a laptop, the guys have spares (and I can bring a spare too). They will also be rolling it out in other parts of the country.

Head on over [to the site](http://codrcamp.com/) to find out the details and register your child. You can also [follow them on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/coderdojo). I'll hopefully see you at the next one.

Hugh Does it Again,"I think I've pretty much seen every TV programme that Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has made. The quality/interest has varied over the years but I'm really digging (pun intended) this new series.

The show has the same premise as things like Jamie at Home where the focus is on growing and cooking seasonally. Obviously this is all about Spring and early summer and the first episode focused on lettuce, spinach etc.

You won't see a huge number of recipes but you will see different approaches to vegetables and produce so that they go centre stage. BBQing Little Gems is something I'm definitely going to try.

Two other aspects of the show are a bit shoe-horned in but still welcome. He's reprising the smallholding idea from his chicken series and following/helping a group of families in Bristol create an allotment with a few animals (initially pigs). I liked the fact that the kids were far more down to earth about the fact that pigs are lovely animals but they are also meat. Some of the more flighty adults should listen to them!

The ""get a vegetarian to eat meat"" section was odd but one of my favourite bits. The woman wasn't a proper vegetarian in the sense that she just decided meat was ""icky"" when she was younger and stopped eating it rather than having any philosophical issues with it. She was taught how to break down a lamb carcass by Hugh's butcher which reminded me of him doing the same thing on a pig in Ballymaloe several years ago. They then had lamb burgers which she liked and lamb neck which she didn't.

![Butcher\](http://www.channel4.com/food/images/mb/Channel4/4Food/ontv/RiverCottage/river_cottage_spring/episode-2/river_cottage_spring_episode_2_gallery_07--gt_full_width_landscape.jpg)

Hugh also made dandylion and burdock beer from the local hedgerows. The guy helping him had previously had a bad pint of same many years previously and was very dubious. However, three weeks of brewing and Hugh had a winner on his hands. I'm _almost_ tempted to try.

The honey face-off with the kid from Hackney was great fun and the fact that you can move bees 3 feet or 3 miles but nothing in between was news to me. To move them a few hundred yards, you have to move them a few miles first and then bring them back or they get confused by the landmarks. So bee brains can store landmark information? That's better than many people :-)

So an odd mish-mash of ideas and snippets but it all hangs together well. If you are interested in food gardening and cooking, as I am, you should watch it."
"Hugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Conor","The long awaited day finally arrived last saturday. For my Christmas present last year, the world's best wife got  me a place at Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's ""Pig in A Day"" course in Ballymaloe Cookery School. I hared it over to Shanagarry early on Saturday and arrived just in time.

In my gormless naivete, I thought it would be an up-close-and-personal session with maybe 6-10 people. It never struck me that this was not financially feasible. So a big shock awaited me when I entered and found approx 60 people all seated watching Hugh prep. Poor muggins ended up down the back - hence the brutal quality of the photos.

The title of the session was ""A Pig in a day with Hugh and Ray"". Ray being the butcher guy who made several appearences on River Cottage. It was a very well oiled double act with Ray doing the butchery of the pig and Hugh doing the cooking. 

The demo-kitchen in Ballymaloe was fantastic. Huge long worktop where they did their work, with a giant angled mirror behind so you could see everything and then two monitors focussed on the worktop. Even the two boys were impressed. 

[![The Big Mirror in Ballymaloe](http://static.flickr.com/32/55584952_8644620dc9_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/55584952/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I was very surprised to then see that Darina was staying for the entire day's session. She did a huge amount - helping, querying, guiding prompting and taking notes.  All male heads turned at once about half way through when Rachel appeared to have a quick word with Darina.

I was a little disappointed that they did not start with a full pig but the reasoning was that they could achieve more in the day if some of the basics were already done (head removed, brains out ect). The pig was one of Darina's organic boyos who had been slaughtered and hung in Midleton on the Wednesday.

First off was a general discussion on the anatomy of the pig and how Ray intended cutting it up. I knew zero about where all the bits were until then (ok apart from maybe the trotters and the tail). He then started taking it apart with great skill whilst Hugh started on the Brawn. This is basically the head cut in four and boiled with a bunch of veg for a few hours. I never got to see the final result but the idea is that the meat is then stripped off the bones and a kind of rough terrine made. 

Once Ray had the loins ready they were given a spicy rub and popped into the oven for our lunch. Something very smutty about that last line.

Then onto the pork liver terrine. Here the mincer was brought into action (""I'm free Mrs Sloacombe"") and a mix made of pork offcuts, liver, and spices. This was put in a terrine pot lined with bacon and then put in a bain-marie.

All the while, the two lads were extremely entertaining, informative and their enthusiasm was infectious. I took a bunch of photos at coffee break as the ones up until then had all been rubbish.

[![Hugh Posing for a photograph](http://static.flickr.com/28/55584765_aef17fe334_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/55584765/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Then they moved onto one of the main reasons I was there - sausage making! I bought a Kenwood Chef with mincer attachment and sausage making kit last year and have yet to use it. Fear mixed with total cluelessness about where I would get the sausage casings were the main reasons. A long session ensued with the discussion on the contents of the mix taking a lot of the time. This was a big interactive session with several people trying their hand at making the actual sausages. One guy even made a good stab at doing the butcher style linking of loads of them. 

[![Ray](http://static.flickr.com/30/55585030_c7ce8e3857_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/55585030/ ""Photo Sharing"")

At that point they answered one of my questions - don't ask your local butcher for casings as you are basically implying that you think you can do a better job of sausage making than him. Hugh highly recommended [The Natural Casing Company](http://www.naturalcasingco.co.uk/) in the UK. I emailed them today to check on postage to Ireland and mentioned the fact that I had been on a Hugh course. They replied, thanking me for explaining why they got so many calls from Ireland today! My order for Hog Casings is going in tomorrow.

As we ran towards lunch, Hugh decided to quickly cook up two things which cause many people to wince - kidneys and brains. Kidneys first - he challenged anyone in the audience who thought they did not like kidneys (and there were many) to try his devilled ones. I don't mind kidneys at all and these ones were wonderful with a huge kick of cayenne.

He then asked if anyone wanted to try brains. My hand shot up. No way I was mising an opportunity to quote George Romero. He had boiled them earlier and now fried them. But a pigs brain is quite small (""mmm,mud"") and there was a melee with people trying to get a taste and I ended up getting none. So no prions for me then.

[![Pig Brains](http://static.flickr.com/26/55584448_74cb6591c8_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/55584448/ ""Photo Sharing"")

We then broke for lunch which was superb. Starter was pea and mint soup which was the nicest I have ever eaten. Main was built around the pork loin which had the nicest crackling of all time. But with this went some of the sausages from earlier (predicted to be bland as they should really sit for a day; they were), salad and some salamis from the [Gubbeen Smokehouse](http://www.gubbeen.com/) in Schull. I've had these salamis before and they are gorgeous.  Fingal Ferguson, the maker, was there and Darina asked him to tell us what each type was. I was scanning the room to see which old geezer was talking - it turned out to be the guy who looked about 15 years old just ahead of me. Young whippersnapper making me feel un-accomplished! 

[![Ray with Fingal](http://static.flickr.com/24/55584647_6f94d1888c_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/55584647/ ""Photo Sharing"")

The crowd was interesting. The usual batch of know-it-all foodies who only asked questions so they could let us all know how much they knew. Four pig farmers.  A lot of Brits (Hugh groupies?) and a bunch of pretty average nobodies like myself. 

One guy had bugged me through the session - always talking, questioning, interrupting; Talked like pure D4; Haircut from Toni & Guy; name dropping Allen family members. Hated him. Of course I ended up sitting at the same table as him. He never stopped talking at lunch, and the more he talked the more I liked him. All of the ""annoying"" attributes were just youthful enthusiasm. Then someone at the table asked him how ""Cully & Sully"" was doing. I wondered how this person knew him. So I finally looked at the name-tag: ""Cullen Allen, Ballymaloe House"". Ah for jaysus sake, he lives here, he is one of them. Now it all made sense. And I liked him even more. 

[Cully & Sully](http://www.cullyandsully.ie/) is a fabulous business idea and I think they will be very successful. If you are a pub in the Cork region and want high-quality hot food that you can serve but only have a toaster and a microwave, then give these guys a call. Their sous-vide food sounds great - I'm going to try and find their one customer in Clon soon. They hope to have some in Bandon in the near future.

I had a great chat with another guy at the table who was also there because his wife had bought it for him. But he was a really interesting character as he rears pigs the ""usual"" way - i.e. industrial production. He was actually a down-shifter who had left corporate life, bought a pig-farm in Tullow and was doing very well and loving his new way of life. 

We both agreed that there were serious issues to address if he was to even consider looking at the ""Hugh way"". His costs would go through the roof and unless he could somehow find another sales channel, he had no way of differentiating his pork/bacon from anyone else. As he said ""to the average punter, a rasher is a rasher"". He quoted the Rudd's example of someone trying to build a premium bacon business - they went bust. I mentioned that the big advantage that Hugh or Jimmy Doherty have in the UK is population density. Even if you sent up a farm shop in the countryside over there, your potential local market is far bigger than anything you would have here. Lots of food for thought.

I knew from the start of the day that I was leaving early to get down to Caroline's wedding in Killarney but I was hoping to see either the Chorizo or the air-dryed ham preparation. I was gutted when Darina announced that the afternoon session was not starting until 2.45 which was only a few mins before I was going to leave. So I had to make my excuses and head back to Bandon.

[![Pig Leg before anything done to it](http://static.flickr.com/24/55584721_8c32bbf8dd_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/55584721/ ""Photo Sharing"")

But that was one bloody brilliant (can't find more expressive terms) morning. I learned tons. I wrestled with the ""could I do that for a living?"" question.

Hulk Hogan vs Philip  Yaksplitter  Johnston in Warhammer Smackdown,"Get ready Grapple Fans for the bout of the century. Exclusive Sky Sports coverage of the Warhammer 40k Premier Competition & Invitational Only, Grand Tournament.

In the Green corner, Philip Johnston, fresh from battle success as far apart as Dublin, Cork and Birmingham. This week, Nottingham is bracing itself for the onslaught of 149 of Europe's other top gaming nerd-meisters.

You've seen Superbowl, you've seen WWF, now get ready for Total Global Annihilation with the Dice of Doom!

In all seriousness, Philip the bruv-in-law is one of the best Warhammer players in Ireland and the UK. He started playing as a young pup and has had to put up with his family calling it ""playing with your little men"" for far too long. I think it's about time he started referring to golf as ""playing with your little balls"".

I'm not sure if he is spoofing the Sky Sports bit (they show stranger things on Extreme Sports) but there is a webcam shot here:

I am the grim reaper for Texas Heroes,"I just had a comment posted to my old blog by Kim on something [I wrote about Bill Hicks back last May](http://conoro.blogspot.com/2005/05/wee-dram-of-bill-hicks-for-dark-wet.html). She was stunned that I saw him live about a year before he died and wanted some details. It is odd timing that she posted now considering I'm just back from Austin. But I was also thinking about Bill when I was over there.

I was in the airport and spotted some Stevie Ray Vaughan CDs. I've liked him for years but wouldn't be a fanatic. Having said that, the man was a genius with a guitar. His Voodoo Chile is probably as good as Jimi's. I managed to see him live too in Stuttgart in 1988\. We were really going to see The Hothouse Flowers who were playing support but every other person in the stadium was there to worship Stevie. The CD I bought on Saturday was a recording of a tribute concert with the likes of Clapton, BB King, Robert Kray and others covering Stevie classics. Bloody good. Ripped to MP3 already (if IRMA want to take me to court).
Here we have two guys from Texas, both the very best in their field, I see them perform live and they both croak it wayyyy before their time. Coincidence? I think not. Let's just say Willie Nelson, Michael Dell and ZZ Top better stay the hell away from me.

But back to Kim's question's about Bill. It was in 1993 I think so we're talking a long 13 years ago. I can't remember what I did yesterday so the details of that long ago are pretty vague. We saw him in the Tivoli theatre in Dublin (Ireland). We were to the side of the stage about two rows back. I had seen his videos before so some of the material was familiar but the switch from smoking lover to hater was a bit of a shock. He was also doing his ""big opening"" with smoke, lights, a big hat and Hendrix music. Didn't really work for me but the show more than made up for it.

My main recollection of the night (apart from Goat Boy) was that my sister was rotten drunk and kept shouting ""Yoh Bill! Woo hoo! yeah!"" after every punch-line. His material is still hilarious after all these years. I couldn't believe it when Gulf War II was building up and the media started using the phrase ""Elite Republican Guard"" all over again. Some things never change.

Yesterday I tried to create a new classic instant meal. I decided to traverse the extremes from MSG to Midleton by creating a masterpiece consisting of Koka Chicken ""flavoured"" Noodles, leftover sausages and Organic Rocket Pesto from the Midleton Farmers market.

Next week, I will give details of the current greatest instant meal of all time which I have eaten since I was a kid: Heinz Spaghetti Hoops nestling on a bed of processed ham delicately covered in a layer of grated cheddar with optional Chef Brown Sauce. Plate-licking-tastic.

Catherine was putting the cards up on the mantlepiece when she noticed something odd about one of them. Check it out:

Any movie that uses their music gets an instant thumbs up from me. I think that's why I have a soft spot for ""[Lost in Translation](http://imdb.com/title/tt0335266/)"" - they played ""Just Like Honey"" in the closing scene.

The only (and I mean only) redeeming aspect of this was that the 100 songs were pre-selected (why???) and viewers just had to vote on the order. This would explain the lack of people like Leonard Cohen, Nina Simone, Cream, Muddy Waters. Hell even Queens of The Stone Age and The Kings of Leon have more talent in their toes than goddammed Dido (placed 57th).

""finger up right nostril"" ""finger up left nostril"" ""bogey rolling"" ""bogey flicking"". Still it's probably more interesting than the next Marian Keyes pot-boiler.

I've finally found a running audio setup that works,"I've been running slowly since 2009. This year has seen two and a half marathons so far, with the [Clon Half](http://runclon.ie/) probably ending the year nicely. But since the very first run I've struggled with audio. I think most people listen to music and I've done that a bit but I've spent far more time listening to Podcasts. I listened to Kermode and Mayo on my first Half Marathon in Dingle in 2010 and I listened to them again a few weeks ago in Dingle in the 2015 Half.

The problem is when you're in the middle of a podcast and either you find it boring or it annoys you so much you have to turn it off. Some of the more ""worthy"" American ones are very hit and miss. As my phone is normally strapped to my arm with a headphone lead snaking down my sleeve, the only thing I can really do is leave the podcast running and pull out the earbuds from my ears. Actually I normally only run with one earbud in for safety.

I've tried over-ear Bluetooth headphones as a solution but, as a glasses wearer, they give me a headache.

I've also tried expensive in-ear ones with inline audio controls. But Samsung, in its brilliance, doesn't support them on the S6, apart from play/pause.

Sidebar: Google and Apple, get into a room, agree a standard one-wire low power digital protocol for audio and bloody implement it. For the love of god.

In the past I'd tried some cheap Chinese Bluetooth adapters too but they were useless and fiddly.

Then two weeks ago, I discovered that Sony released a pair of ear buds with a Bluetooth audio adapter ages ago, and the reviews were all positive. The official name is Sony SBH20 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headset with NFC and Multi-Point Connectivity. Even better, because it's getting-on a bit, the price is now really low. I got mine on [7dayshop.com](https://www.7dayshop.com/products/sony-sbh20-stereo-bluetooth-wireless-headset-with-nfc-and-multi-point-connectivity-black-WH2-SBH20BK) for £15 delivered!

![Sony SBH20](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sbh20bk-01_1_small.png)

I assumed I'd switch the Sony earbuds for something better but they have proven to be perfect for podcasts. They also have very short leads, so you can clip the adapter to the neck of your running top, stick one bud in one ear, loop around your neck and stick the other bud in the other ear. Nothing is left to flap around. It gives you play/pause, prev/next and vol up/down. Works perfectly in BeyondPod on Android. I assume it'd be the same on iPhone. After two runs with them, I'm completely sold.

My next job is to get the podcasts and music visible in one app and build a mixed playlist for the [Clon Half](http://runclon.ie/half-marathon/). Something like Rocky definitely needed for that last hill."

I had to wrestle the spoon off Catherine so we could put them aside for later when the sauce would be de-frosted.

Listening to Kieran and Seán on [Winter Food](http://www.rte.ie/radio1/winterfood/1082885.html), I realise that they have far too much in common with Catherine for them to ever meet. She is toying with the idea of offering to be an unpaid tester for them. She is eating for two you know.

It is usually a long process for us to come up with the final name for each of our children. Fionn was named as the epi went in. This next baby has already been named: Uachtar Reoite Ó Néill.

Whilst I am here, any ideas why the ice-cream from our cheapy ice-cream maker is really solid and dense in comparison to the lightness of Murphy's?

A bunch of us geeks attended the pretty weak Le Web 3 conference in December 2006\. The main party was on near l'Opera and we wanted to get something decent to eat (we'd had a Chinese the previous night!).

Jan from [Touristr](http://www.touristr.com/) is French and knew of an ""institution"" called Au Petit Riche which has been around since the mid 1800's. It was only a few minutes from the incredible Haussmann animated shop-window Christmas display which made the Switzers/BT display look like a sad joke!

I was immediately impressed by the stall outside the restaurant selling Oysters.

[![Au Petit Riche Restaurant](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/142/323910127_9be2ad0d32_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/323910127/ ""Photo Sharing"")

 It turns out that the people selling them have been supplying the restaurant for generations. Could you imagine something so cool outside an Irish place?

Inside was broken into large booths with maybe four tables in each. A giant cheese sat on the counter. The waiters were grumpy which made me happy.

There was no problem seating the 6 of us.

The menus came out and I realised they served traditional classic French food; escargot, fois gras, tete de vache, oysters. I drooled. Then I saw the fixed price menu cost - €30! I was gobsmacked. All of us went with it except Joe who wanted the fois gras and who will probably be stabbed by Keith the next time he meets him ;-)

I went with snails to start which were awesome, dripping in garlic butter in one of those compartmentalised dishes.

Unfortunately I decided to be adventurous and have the calf's head for main. This was a mix of cheek, tongue and brain. It came out in a mini crock-pot thing and was basically a watery stew with those components and some veg along with a nice side gribbiche sauce.

The problem was that most of the meat was wobbly non-rendered fat and just wasn't very appetising. I was glad to try it but won't do it again. Brains were fine!

We nearly all went with the creme brulee which was killer - one of the best ever. Great coffee too.

The highlight for me was the fun we had with the wine. I was brow beating Jan about how the French approach of having 16-word titles on wine had no hope of working in the modern world where the Aussies just said ""Shiraz"". He argued that there is far more to wine than the grape and that needed to be highlighted on the bottle. Yes terroir came up.

The waiter gave Jan the wine menu and to his credit he admitted defeat! It consisted of maybe 8 or 9 sections. Within each section was a type of wine and then just a list like this:

*   2004 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil La Coudraye
*   2003 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Les Quartiers
*   2004 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Tin Pan Alley
*   2003 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Yama Lama Ding Dong
*   2004 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Nanoo Nanoo

Over and over.

I asked him what the difference between each one was and he didn't know. He called over the waiter who was similarly stumped. He called the sommelier and had a detailed chat of which I caught a tiny part. The sommelier had narrowed it down to Yannick Amirault Bourgueil La Coudrayeand Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Les Quartiers.

I said ""Jan please tell me that I misheard and he didn't say that the only difference between those two wines is the side of the valley they were grown on in the vineyard."". Oh yes indeedy! However the sommelier had described the differences between them. One fruitier, the other more dry etc. So we got one and enjoyed it immensely. 

[![Au Petit Riche Restaurant](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/323909008_6b55152964_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/323909008/ ""Photo Sharing"")

My googling afterwards showed that it is a very highly regarded but inexpensive Cabernet Franc from the Touraine region of the Loire Valley.

We finished the first bottle and then agreed we would try the other variant ""just to see"". Conor is a donkey - we could all bloody tell the difference and none of us are wine experts. Wow! Sodding Aussies have been conning us for twenty years.

Only problem is that my brain is too small to remember all the French info.

Back to the restaurant. Great great food in a lovely location with a killer price. If you are around l'Opera in Paris, you should definitely give it a go.

I'm glad I'm a bloke,"We are now 23 hours and 35 minutes away from Catherine being induced in the Bons. We still haven't figured out if it is inducement or induction and we are having last minute hesitations about the name we have picked for him. We had decided on Cavan O'Neill but my mother objected and thought we should compromise on Navan O'Neill. 

Babba was 9lbs last week. I don't even want to think what weight he is now. We have the Epi booked for insertion in the car park (no point in wasting time) and this time we have a pregnancy TENS machine. Turns out the one we used for Oscar was for sore knees. Might explain Catherine's slight discomfort during his delivery.....

Just as with the DeepImpact mission to Tempel 1, we will be broadcasting as-it-happens footage from the delivery room via Nokia Crap-Cam.

The next Blog posting will probably be a picture of the 87th Sudoku puzzle that Catherine has completed whilst wating for Baby Anakin to arrive.

I'm in Far Eastern Foodie Heaven,"The recent review of CX Oriental by [Messy Chef](http://messy-chef.com/blog/2009/09/cx-oriental-cash-carry/) was the final push I needed to check this place out today after months of saying I must. It's just fantastic. If you have ever raved about Asia Market in Dublin, this is 10x better.

If you have driven past Kinsale Road Roundabout in the past few months you can't have missed the huge signs for CX Oriental Cash and Carry. Whilst Cork has had the brilliant Mr Bell's in The English Market for years, it suffers from lack of space and the awkwardness of getting to it so this morning I finally made the trip to the Cash and Carry.

It's pretty easy to find. Head past Harvey Normans off the Kinsale Road Roundabout, take the left at the lights onto Tramore Road and watch out for the many signs. My first surprise (and relief) was that they take credit cards. My second was that they have a noodle bar restaurant there open 7 days a week which was hopping.

The place is massive. It starts with a lot of huge freezers filled with all sorts of fish, meat and desserts. I got some tiger prawns and some spring roll sheets.

The fresh produce area and fridge is small but jammed full of stuff you just won't get elsewhere including veg I've never seen before, multiple types of tofu, chillis, enoki mushrooms, mangoes and drinks. The fresh fish section looked awesome too but I didn't get anything today.

I put together a list of ingredients from Rick Stein's new Far Eastern book and found everything on it with no problems. They also obviously sell in bulk to restaurants and had lots of the Musgraves type things like foil containers and cups, in addition to woks, chopsticks, strainers, steamers etc.

Not much else to say except if you are doing any sort of Far Eastern cooking then it will be hard to keep you away from the place. The value is also stunningly good compared to supermarkets.

Here are some pictures I took whilst shopping:

"I'm not eating that, it's for cats","Oisín continues to come out with the funniest lines in the house. He refused to eat his dinner yesterday on the grounds that it was food for cats. Were we trying to feed him Whiskas perhaps? Or maybe KiteKat or Iams? No, it was lasagne.

All of this because his older brother, in an effort to get him to eat it, pointed out that lasagne is what Garfield eats.

I'm not making this up,"[Ivan Pope has voted for me](http://blog.snipperoo.com/2007/02/snipperoo_users.html) in the Irish Blog Awards. Ivan runs a great tech company in the UK called, wait for it......[Snipperoo](http://www.snipperoo/). I knew there was a reason I put his widget in the sidebar of this blog rather than my business one!

In any case, 21 hours to go in [the voting](http://www.awards.ie/vote/). Check out my nominations to the right there, check out all the others over at [Jason Roe's blog](http://www.jason-roe.com/blog/blog-awards-voting-opens/), and if you think I'm worth it, gis a vote.

And check out Snipperoo, if you like adding extra functionality to the sidebar of your blog, it really is sweet. I'll be adding it to [Argolon](http://www.argolon.com/) and [LouderVoice](http://blog.loudervoice.com/) as soon as my currently very dicky tummy settles down."
I'm playing GAA like Rooney,"So he is only five years old and this was his first ever GAA session. 

He reported back that he played hurling and soccer. His Nana from Meath better have a word with him about Gaelic Football. 

Next week we are sending him in Kilkenny gear to shake things up a bit ;-)

Bloody hell, now I have two hurlers in the house. Who would ever have thought?"

[Lo-Fart beans developed
](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16324846&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=lo-fart-beans--name_page.html)

Great news considering the diet I'm on right now."
Importing from Blogger/Blogspot to Wordpress,"I'm in the process of trying to move off a free Blogspot account over to Wordpress for my personal blog. I have yet to decide whether to use something free like [Blogsome ](http://www.blogsome.com/)or get hosted with a wordpress.org recommended Host like [PowWeb](http://powweb.com/) or an Irish host like [Blacknight](http://www.blacknight.ie/). If anyone has opinions on these alternatives, I'd be very interested in hearing them. If the Irish option is reasonable, I'd obviously prefer to go with that. 

My concern about Blogsome is the lack of a business model to support their free hosting. PowWeb looks like a no-brainer but if the Blacknight alternative is competitive both technically and price-wise then I'd probably go with that.

But ignoring that for a minute, my biggest concern was that I'd be able to move all my old Blogspot posts and comments over to Wordpress. I have just done a trial run using instructions I found on [Andy Skelton's site](http://catsutorials.catsudon.org/?p=15). It is as awkward as hell but it worked perfectly - I now have posts from 2001-2005 residing on my Fedora box at home after 30 minutes of fiddling.

The only other annoyance is that I have the conoroneill.com domain registered with Yahoo Domains. I then point it at wherever I happen to be doing my posts to. Ideally I'd like to move that over completely to the new host and not need re-directs. This looks messy so any tips there appreciated too."
Impress with Wordpress,"<div style=""clear: both"" />Sometimes I identify great software at first sight (XEmacs, Eclipse, VMWare, GMail) and sometimes I need to be beaten over the head with it (Subversion, NetBeans, Flickr).

I have seen references to Wordpress constantly on blogs and for some reason never checked it out, which is totally out of character for a click-junkie like me. But I was getting frustrated with Blogger and the difficulty in customising it and started looking around. I also had the cunning idea of moving the [Argolon Solutions](http://www.argolon.com/) Web-Site over to a Blog-based solution as a sort of mini-CMS. All roads seemed to lead to Wordpress.

One quick download later; holy crap, this thing is fabulous. It took all of 5 minutes (max) to install on my Win2K box (already running Apache, MySQL and PHP). Two minutes to configure and I was doing test posts less than 10 minutes after doing the download. So I re-tried on the Fedora box - just as quick, just as easy. Then I tried doing a test install on the Argolon site hosted by Hosting365\. OK, this took longer as I wasn't sure how to unzip the distro without shell access. But a bit of messing and it was up and running in about 20 minutes.

I've looked at tons of sample templates and found a few doozies. So now I need to decide (a) do I move Argolon over to it and (b) where/how will I host it for conoroneill.com? All links to my current blog are to conoro.blogspot.com. I need to think more about this.

So if you are in the market for a brilliantly easy, totally free, utterly configurable blogging system, go grab Wordpress and play.

After my SF disaster of driving up, failing to get parking and driving back to Santa Clara, I grumpily decided to check out In-n-Out Burger for once and for all. This is California's most famous burger chain and many burger fanatics rave about it.

The decor is 50's kitsch and works well. Service was friendly as with nearly everywhere in the US, even if I sometimes feel that Texans really mean it when Californians just say it. But he did miss half my order which was a bit annoying. The In-n-Out bit was a misnomer as I then had to wait ten minutes to actually get the food. The value was great - a ""Double Double"" burger, fries and a shake for just over $5.

Is it the greatest burger ever? Nah, but as fast food goes it is pretty bloody good. Juicy, tasty meat, a good bun and a great sauce. Excellent crispy fries and a lovely shake. Head and shoulders above a Micky D's or Burger King.

Not worth flying to California for but I left with a nice full belly and a warm glow.

Whilst I am at it, the three other places we ate:
Applebees, McCarthy Ranch- pretty crap but edibleish
Tomatina, Mission College Blvd - excellent pizza and Sam Adams
La Pastaia, downtown San Jose - good Italian food but empty

Inaugural Bandon Farmer's Market a huge success,"I'm delighted to report that the first Farmer's Market in Bandon was a resounding success despite the awful weather. I'm already looking forward to next months and I hope they consider moving it to every week if the crowds hold up.

First off, apologies for the shockingly bad quality of the photos. I have the aesthetic eye of a blind person.

I headed up initially just after 10am with two of the kids. But the skies had opened and it was horrible. Some brave souls had ventured out but it was still pretty quiet at that stage.

[![IMG_2277](http://static.flickr.com/44/121243937_b7ac2cdae3_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/121243937/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Neither kid was exactly impressed and Osc announced at the top of his voice that he wanted to go to a supermarket. Git. I headed back home for an hour to dump them and wait for better weather. Luckily it did improve and I arrived back a bit after 11am. It was mobbed and I was thrilled.

I kicked off with a mango tango smoothie from this stall.

[![IMG_2283](http://static.flickr.com/42/121244249_e1299a4554_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/121244249/ ""Photo Sharing"")

There were some very nice pies and pasties being sold here. I thought the pies were a bit overpriced for the size but the pasties at €3 were spot on. I had one later for my lunch and it was excellent.

[![IMG_2279](http://static.flickr.com/45/121244030_0164b7505f_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/121244030/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Then on to an interesting stall, the Vegetarian Smokehouse. I tried a few of the things on offer and ended up going for a three for a tenner deal. The smoked salsa was yum, the smoked hummous too but the jury is still out on the smoked olives.

[![IMG_2280](http://static.flickr.com/50/121244093_9f8c5999b4_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/121244093/ ""Photo Sharing"")

There was some nice fruit and veg here but I didn't get anything this time.

[![IMG_2281](http://static.flickr.com/29/121244133_669e9ce5ef_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/121244133/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I spotted a sausage stall and raced over. It turned out to be one of the two great butchers in Bandon, Martin Carey. I went for the South African thingy and some Italian Fennel sausage. I do hope that Dan Moloney (the other excellent butcher in town) considers doing a stall with extra-long-aged premium beef, I think he would do a roaring trade.

I moved on to Frank Krawczyk's stall. Some day I will learn how to pronounce his surname. I had some of his salami in [Boqueria Tapas](http://www.boqueriasixbridgest.com/) last week and told him so. He told me all about his various salamis and kassler and I tried the lot. All were completely fantastic and I bought some of everything.

[![IMG_2285](http://static.flickr.com/33/121244340_aef0e664ac_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/121244340/ ""Photo Sharing"")

We also talked about chorizo. He does make some but was sold out and told me that it is his own particular twist on chorizo. We agreed that there was no point in creating some sort of facsimilie of a product from somewhere else, Irish artisan products should be unique even if they start as derivations of things from elsewhere.

[![IMG_2286](http://static.flickr.com/32/121244387_81d705b6ed_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/121244387/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Then the conversation moved to cheese and all the great producers in West Cork and how each of them has created something related to other cheeses but completely unique too. The people who created [Milleens ](http://www.milleenscheese.com/)seem to have been the catalyst for much of the West Cork cheese business. I had never tasted it.

But the very next stall I visited was the [Urru ](http://www.urru.ie/)one. Ruth, the owner was very involved in kicking off the market and had a range of cheeses, treats and coffees on display. And happily for me, she had Milleens which I bought along with some [Cork Coffee Roasters](http://www.corkcoffee.com/) coffee which they were sampling.

When I got home I tried the Milleens which didn't really have a strong flavour. I then tried Frank's Kassler which was very strong. Then I put the two of them together. A match made in heaven. Tomorrow will see me have a ham n cheese sambo like no other.

There was a lovely selection of herbs to eat and grow on this stall. I will definitely buy some the next time.

I had a good chat with Anthony on the [Ummera ](http://www.ummera.com/)stand. They had their full selection of smoked products on display and they were flying off the stall. Bandon and Kinsale are the two markets that Ummera are focused on right now and both towns are the better for it. I would encourage you all to check out his [blog at Wordpress.com](http://ummera.wordpress.com/) and post some comments.

I headed up to the very tasty looking confectionary stall to get a few treats. It turned out to be Gwen's Chocolates from Schull. They had a lovely selection of individual chocolates and boxed ones too. I got a small bag of em to share at home with d'wife.

[![IMG_2297](http://static.flickr.com/41/121244884_1a0b709185_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/121244884/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Midday arrived and the Market was officailly opened by Mayor Don McCarthy and the creator of the [Bridgestone Guides](http://www.bestofbridgestone.com/index.shtml), John McKenna. John had some very apt words to say about food miles and seemed to be genuinely excited to see the launch of a new market.

I think Mayor Don's day job is the running of the Riverview Shopping Centre. I think it would be a very useful exercise for him to check with all of the shops in Riverview to see if their business went up today. I find it hard to believe that all those crowds were just locals having a gawk.

[![IMG_2304](http://static.flickr.com/52/121243738_9c1cb08da3_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/121243738/ ""Photo Sharing"")

The horrible weather ebbed and flowed all day but for the time I was there, the crowds persisted. Imagine if the weather had been good!

The only things I thought missing were [a] more farmers! and [b] someone doing good eggs and dairy. On that topic, I heard [a wonderful podcast recently](http://www.restaurantguysradio.com/sle/rg/content/shows/index.asp?show_id=157) on the topic of raw milk in the US. It is banned in most states. What is the story here? Obviously there are raw milk cheeses, but can you buy non-pasteurised milk anywhere? I think maybe I had it straight from the cow once from my grand-aunt down in Adamstown in Wexford but that's it. I wonder is there any demand for somehow ""safety certified"" but non-pasteurised milk in Ireland?

In any case, the next Bandon Farmer's Market is on  Saturday May 6th. It is well worth making the effort to check it out.

Finally, apologies to those stalls that I didn't mention yet. There are plenty of interesting looking bread/cake vendors and preserves/relish vendors that I will get to the next time along with any others that have slipped my mind.

I find it interesting that many people are still more comfortable sending me e-mails to ask questions rather than writing comments on the blog. I include all of my family except big sis in that group. 

Do feel free to post any comments you like, you don't have to give your full name (most don't) and only I'll see the email address. Blogs should be conversations rather than monologues.

In any case, I got a question from Clare asking about Indian restaurants in Bandon and I thought I'd post the gist of my reply here.

I haven't done sit-down in either of the Indians in Bandon but I've had plenty of takeaways from Anarkali (023-29762). They are a bit hit and miss but the good dishes are really good.

 The chilli garlic dishes are lovely, saffron chicken very nice, bhunas are good, dopiazas are good but their chicken tikka masala is awful for some reason. They seem to do creamy dishes badly. 

All of their starters are really good. The restaurant itself is quite basic (and has a lot of take-away customers coming and going) but they are extremely friendly people. It's a husband and wife team, one Indian, the other Pakistani. I also think they do BYOB.

I haven't eaten anything from the one that was The Chapel Steps but it has already changed hands after only a few months in operation. My wife heard that it was not good when it was called Moghul. I'm not encouraged by the new owners describing it as ""exotic cuisine"". I think currys stopped being exotic in the 70's :-) 

We've eaten in one of the Indians in Clon too. Not sure if it was Cobra or the other one (it's on the same side as the bike shop)  and it was in the category of not too bad. Tiniest kitchen ever!

Infacterly Butterly,"This guy is more and more impressive by the day. Not only is this just an awesome idea for a wet miserable June Bank Holiday Sunday but it also makes me think back maybe 30 years ago to when my grandaunts down in ""The Boola"" in Adamstown in Wexford used to make butter. I still remember the ridged wooden paddles they used to form the butter and how gorgeous everything they fed us was (those eggs, mmmmmm).

It's interesting that the life they led - tenant farmers, rearing their own pigs/cows/chickens, eating their own milk products, eggs, vegetables etc is now an aspirational lifestyle for so many people. Obviously these downshifters wouldn't be too happy about using the outdoor chemical toilet we found so gross! It's a pity I can't ask my old relations if they'd prefer that life or ""modern life"" as the only one alive is sadly now confined to a nursing home due to Alzheimers. However she is over 90 years old which is a nice confirmation of what the author below tells us about the nonsense spewed in the media about cholesterol and saturated fats.

Interested in helping us test LouderVoice?,"Those of you who know me well also know that I've spent the past few months working hard on building a new web-site called [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/). We're coming close to launching the site properly (probably in late January or early February) but before we do we would really like to have some people help us try out the site and tell us what they think. 

The plan at the moment is that we'll be inviting a very small number of people we know into the Beta1 phase in the next few days. This is because we know there are missing features and some holes in the error handling but it is still a highly functional application and we want to get that initial feedback. The focus in that phase is around features not stability. Questions we will be asking include:

*   What features do you like?
*   What do you not like?
*   What's missing?
*   Would you use the following if we implemented it?

We will then move into Beta2 in January with a much bigger group of people and with the functionality that the early group thought was top priority. We will continue to ask questions about functionality but the main focus will be stability and usability.

So who should sign up? Actually a few different groups of people.

1.  Bloggers - as many of you as possible. If you have one reader or a thousand, we want to hear from you. If you have ever written valuable information that you think others will find useful, then I think you'll like what we have to offer you.
2.  Searchers - During Beta the volume of content will be small but we'd love some enthusiastic testers to sign up and make sure you have everything you need to find and use the information on the site
3.  The Opinionated - If you don't blog but are willing to create interesting useful information which will always belong to you building your reputation, then we'll provide the tools you need to get heard.

So go on, we're sure you are going to love this site and the only thing you need to provide is your e-mail address. We promise never to use it for any purpose other than inviting you to try the Beta. We will never sell your e-mail address to anyone. 

[Sign-Up is here](http://www.loudervoice.com/).

Interested in what the papers were saying up to 200 years ago?,"Well Google have just released their most impressive service in a long long time. Over at [News Archive Search](http://news.google.com/archivesearch?hl=en) you can search on a bunch of newspapers worldwide going way back. In many cases you have to pay to see the scan of the paper itself but you can read the actual text for free.

As a test I put in the phrase ""famine Ireland"" and then selected ""before 1880"" and found a newspaper article from The Republican Compiler of Gettysburg on March 1st 1847 which mentions the suffering caused by the Irish famine.

This is an incredibly powerful tool for anyone interested in what was really going on at a particular time rather than the interpretation put on things by historians. 

As a tool for schoolkids, it really does boggle the mind compared to what I grew up with. I remember our Irish history book in the Inter Cert&nbsp;doing 1922 to 1969 in a couple of pages and&nbsp;then stopping at 1969\. 

Imagine if the Irish Times, The Indo and whoever owns the rights to The&nbsp;Irish Press were to hand over their archives to Google Ireland? Hell, I'd be happy to see my&nbsp;tax euros spent&nbsp;on paying them to do it.

Next query, ""bombing of Dresden"". Dunno why but it was the first thing that popped into my head after the famine. Oh I'm a barrel of laughs today.

Interesting Culinary Vacation Tours of Southwest Ireland,"I've mentioned [Podchef Neal](http://podchef.motime.com/) who is based on an island off Washington State on this blog several times and he posts quite a few comments here too which are always appreciated. I noticed the other day that he is proposing to organise [culinary tours of Cork and the surrounding regions](http://kitchengardenfoods.com/2006/02/28/ireland/) this summer. A large number of my readers are foodies so I'm guessing this could be of serious interest to some of you.

I don't know Neal personally but I am a regular listener to his [Gastrocast podcast](http://podchef.motime.com/post/548580) which really shows how passionate and informed he is about food, cooking and everything related. If such a vacation is something you might be interested in doing, why not [check out his web-site](http://kitchengardenfoods.com/tours/Tours.html), listen to a podcast and drop him a line to find out more?

When I originally read his post about the tours, I assumed the focus would be on American foodies but if you can make your way to Ireland at the right time from anywhere in the world then I assume you could sign up with him? I suppose Jackeens or even Nordies down for July could do it too?

Irish food producers and the Cluetrain Manifesto,"I know absolutely nothing about marketing as I discovered in my first startup enterprise when it took me a year to notice that there was no ""U"" in our ""USP"".

But over the past year I have been watching what Hugh McLeod has been doing with the idea of [The Global Microbrand](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001976.html). Hugh is most famous for using blogging to create worldwide interest and demand for the products of [a Saville Row tailor](http://www.englishcut.com/). Hugh is a disciple of ""[The Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/)"" which is a fantastic rant about where markets are going and how they are changing. The Number 1 thesis of the manifesto is that **Markets are conversations**. The amazing thing about it is that it was written in 1999\. Hugh has a [Hughtrain page](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000823.html) which has some great thoughts on this area too. 

More recently, and of more interest to me, are his efforts to to something similar with [Stormhoek](http://www.stormhoek.com/), a small South African wine company. In this case, one of the approaches is to send out free bottles of wine to bloggers and [hope they blog about it](http://conoroneill.com/2005/09/13/stormhoek-not-quite-stonking-but-pretty-damned-good/). It appears to be working extremely well. There have probably been more words written about Stormhoek in the UK and Ireland in the past few months than about all of the Chilean producers combined. 

The reason I mention all of this is due to a simple thing which happened last week. I [blogged about Ummera Smoked Rashers](http://conoroneill.com/2005/12/05/ummera-do-smoked-bacon/); Anthony Creswell, who owns [Ummera](http://www.ummera.com/), spotted the blog and posted a reply. A few messages passed back and forth and I mentioned that I had never spotted their smoked eel in any of the shops. What does Anthony do? He drops a pack into [Urru ](http://www.urru.ie)(a local gourmet food shop which stocks his smoked chicken and salmon)! I was gobsmacked.

Now, you may think this is just a bit of good customer service with a firm providing product to a local consumer (Ummera is only 10km or so from our house). But I think something far more important started here which is right at the heart of The Cluetrain Manifesto. Quite simply, this would never have happened like this without the ""Read/Write Web"" as it is known. Sure, I could have mailed Ummera and asked who stocks their eel and they could have dropped some into Urru for me. The gain for them? One extra customer.

But funnily enough, some people other than my family and Marky Mark actually read this blog and maybe some think to themselves ""I'd like a bit of that"" and they check out the Ummera web page and they realise Ummera ship world-wide, and they order some and it blows them away with flavour and they blog it and someone else reads their blog and and and and. All from one simple posting on a blog on a machine in California written by paddy in Bandon.

Ummera, [Dunn's](http://www.dunns.ie/), [Clonakilty Black Pudding](http://www.clonakiltyblackpudding.ie/) and a raft of other high quality food producers in Ireland are already global micro-brands so they are not trying to create brand awareness from scratch. But imagine if Ummera or [Gubbeen ](http://www.gubbeen.com/)or Dunn's or [Cashel Blue](http://www.irishcheese.ie/CHEESE_DESCRIPTION/Cheese_Description/J_and_L_Grubb.html) or [Ballymaloe ](http://www.cookingisfun.ie/)had their own blog? Imagine if that blog talked about the things they were trying to develop and their problems and their successes and recipes and ideas and questions and announcements and 1-to-1 customer feedback? 

Foodies would go nuts for this kind of ""inside track"" and tell their friends who would love it and the foodie blogs would be abuzz and others would seek out the product and all of a sudden you have almost free global viral marketing. A simple seed would be for any foodie to post on [eGullet ](http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showforum=9)that ""such and such a producer has a new food blog and I think it is really interesting"". When I did a posting on eGullet to flag [my review of ""A Pig in Day with Hugh and Ray""](http://conoroneill.com/2005/10/24/hugh-pugh-barney-mcgrew-cuthbert-dibble-and-conor/), my blog readership sky-rocketed. Imagine if it finally came full circle and got picked up by the MSM (mainstream media) and they did an article in the Washington Post about this small Irish company with gloabl reach due to blogging......

There are many others who can explain this idea better than I. [A recent interview by Tom Raftery of Steve Rubel ](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/steve-rubel-interview-podcast/)who is a professional PR guy and blogger covers the power of blogging for advertising purposes extremely well. 

Hell, I am surprised that some of the bigger global players are not trying this already at a national level to make themselves appear more ""local"". They already do it with brands (like Campbells Soup owning Erin), why not with ""The Cup of Soup Blog, live from Thurles""? There is a danger that this could be done badly like many of the big US corporate blogs where the blog is little more than another outlet for press releases. But done well, you start a conversation with your customers and find out far more than a million Lansdowne Surveys will ever tell you about what they like and don't like.

Clearly the number of eyeballs is not very high yet but it is growing at a phenomenal rate. And the profile of blog readers is probably exactly the sort of ABC1's that all marketeers want interested in their product.

But as I said, I know zero about marketing so feel free to ignore everything I just wrote and check out the picture of the lobster in my next post.

Irish Immigration Control is a Disgrace,"Today I am embarassed to be Irish. I wish to extend my apologies and those of all reasonable people in this country to [Keola Donaghy](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~donaghy/eng/index.html) and his family.

Keola, who is from Hawaii, arrived earlier today in Dublin with his family to begin his doctoral studies in UCC. He had been assured by the Gardaí in Cork and by UCC that there was no issue with him coming. He has spent months preparing for this move.

At immigration today in the Airport he was told that he could enter but his family could not. Students cannot come with dependents! Keloa declined to break up his family and they will all soon be on a plane back to New York. Many attempts have been made by people today to keep them in the country but to no avail.

I am disgusted by this. Keola has been communicating with many of us in the Irish blogosphere and [twittersphere](http://twitter.com/keoladonaghy) over the past few months. We were all looking forward to meeting him and welcoming him to Ireland. Instead a bunch of people who are answerable to almost no-one decided he didn't fit some nonsense arbitrary criteria.

Ignoring the general issue of immigration control, the fact that we block ANY American coming here is a farce. We would still be scrabbling for rotting potatoes in muck if it wasn't for the kindness of the USA and its citizens over the past 160 years. We should shake the hand of every Yank who comes through immigration control in Dublin or Shannon and thank them for letting us go to the US in our thousands.

I don't know what we can do about this considering that immigration is effectively run by a cabal of bureaucrats whose powers far exceed any that should be acceptable in a democracy. Whoever is responsible for the sort of bullshit terms and conditions which led to Keola heading home needs to change them now! Or was that person thrown out in the last election?

If you know of anything that can be done to remove this stain on our character, please do so.

In addition, whoever in UCC or the Gardaí is responsible for this horrendous error should be removed from that role immediately.

Once again Keola, my apologies for this, those involved should all be ashamed of themselves."
"Irish men of a certain age, brace yourselves","Leslie Dowdall is playing The Brogan Inn in Bandon soon!

Pause, little shudder of excitement, continue.

For those of you too young to remember, Leslie was to many Irish men who are now in their late thirties, the 1980's equivalent of Jessica Alba. I'm not sure if Hot Press had pull-out posters of her, but they should have. She sang with a band called In Tua Nua who were famous for 6 months in Grangemockler (five miles from Windgap). 

[![In-Tua-Nua-Dont-Fear-Me-Now-105381](http://static.flickr.com/110/282666120_08e93d871c_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/282666120/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I've no idea how she has aged and for some reason I can only picture her in my head wearing a big heavy coat rather than anything sexy. This was rural Ireland twenty years ago.

The signs for the gig actually say ""Ex-In Tua Nua"". Is this the equivalent of Pat Rabbitte's election signs saying ""ex-Sinn Fein The Workers Party""? No, they weren't too bad really, they just never grew beyond Ireland.

Thinking of her brought to mind ""Cactus World News"". These guys went ballistic in Ballyhale overnight around the same time and I'll never forget my friend Shaun stating categorically that they would be bigger than U2\. When they disappeared without a trace after the first single, the reason given was that they were purely a studio band and had never gigged. Ah bless, the innocence of the 20th Century. If only they'd had MySpace back then.

If baby wasn't due very soon, I think us auld pair would head out to the gig for a reminisce.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, YouTube is the greatest website ever. [They have a clip of her in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbwXkJXaqYk)! The spectacles weren't that rose tinted.

UPDATE 1: Looks like we may have missed it, I found something on MySpace saying it was on the 20th. Damn.

UPDATE 2: Holy cactus batman, they have clips of Cactus World News [on YouTube too](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cactus+world+news&search=Search). Check out [""The Bridge""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWNPKi_iVXI) which was their only real hit.

UPDATE 3: There is still time! According to [her web-site](http://www.lesliedowdall.com/pages/live.html) the gig is on Nov 24th. She has also gone all cool and done [a MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/lesliedowdallmusic).

Irish Yokels Go London,"In the next few months we're coming up on the 10th wedding anniversary. 

People gave us a week when we first started going out. Our eyes met across a power turbine in the Engineering building in Belfield. I fell for her shaggy perm, she fell for my wooly jumper and combats.

We've talked lots about what to do for our few days away (enabled by my fab parents). Paris maybe where last time we couldn't fine Sacre Cour in the dark. Or Rome, which we chickened out of going to after my namesake's wedding. We settled on London. She spent a summer working in the Cavendish, I've been there maybe four times in my life. Odd for someone who knows tons of Germany and lived in Sunnyvale for nearly six months, I have no clue of London. On a recent trip I spent the entire day saying ""ooh I recognise that....off the telly"".

We have several aims:

*   To do many of the standard sights like London Eye, Imperial War, Tate Modern, Natural History, Victoria & Albert, Science Museum. We are both engineers after all
*   Stay somewhere nice. Not Holiday Inn, not The Savoy. Somewhere a bit special but not bank breaking
*   Eat in all the places we've promised ourselves over the past few years

So Bandon-Fans, I need your brains. We have no clue where to stay but we want it to be central so we can do lots by foot rather than tube. All recommendations for ""boutique"" hotels appreciated.

Food plan was originally to go for The Fat Duck in Bray. Some day we are doing that or El Bulli. But not this time. Our idea right now is:

*   Gordon Ramsey in Claridge's. Lighter than main Ramsey restaurant
*   Nobu. Cos I adore Japanese food. Worked for Toshiba for too long
*   Locanda Locatelli. Cos Tony & Giorgio is still one of my favourite food programmes ever

We would love other restaurant recommendations. Happy to do high end cos it'll be another ten years before we do it again. Hit us with your best material."
IrishWan.org,"I've just found out about [IrishWan.org](http://www.irishwan.org/). This is a fantastic idea leveraging 802.11b technology to creat wireless WANs across cities and towns in Ireland. By connecting the Access Points to ADSL, the potential for reducing internet access cost in Ireland by sharing bandwidth and fees is huge. I must dust off the AP I have at home and see about getting myself an omnidirectional antenna. Anyone with wireless equipment and/or ADSL should get involved here."
Is that a bullseye painted on your back?,"<div style=""clear: both"" />I can't help myself. I know they are world's easiest targets. [Twenty Major](http://twentymajor.blogspot.com/2005/05/eurovision.html) had tears rolling down my face talking about what a pair of utter mingers they are.

But then I found the lyrics - dear god, is English even his first language? ""Love can make you happy, love can make you cry""?

Coincidentally, I found this site which sings lyrics for you. So I entered the first verse. A massive improvement I think you'll agree. The result cudda made us a contenda!

I heard the sister half of the duo on The Ray D'Arcy show. From what red-neck, hick, cousin-marrying, squeal-like-a-pig hole did they crawl out of? She told Ray that she spent her time in Kiev trying to spot ""all the gays"". What age is she? 12? I was expecting Daffyd to suddenly make an appearance.

Next year can we just accept the Eurovision for what it is and send a drag-queen?

Is that a sausage in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?,"Last Saturday, the world was my oyster. Wife n kids were in Cavan, house to myself, I could do anything I liked. Except I'm off booze so getting blotto was out of the question, I'm on a diet so a huge steak n chips was off the menu and I hate sport so a day of Premiership football would be torture. But I was still totally buzzed about making sausages after the Hugh Fearnley-Wearnley-Guernley Course in Ballymaloe. So that's what I did.

 I had ordered the natural casings from the UK and Cecil sent them over quickly. Boy did they stink! Catherine texted me to tell me that Darina's article in the Examiner was about the course and gave recipes for sausages. [Saving The Bacon](http://www.irishexaminer.com/pport/web/supplements/food/Full_Story/did-sgET8O3n9Yo32sgHuTLc4nqWo2.asp). Damn, all of the belly pork might be bought up, so on my bike (literally) and I raced into town.

First into Martin Carey's. They were under pressure and fobbed me off with pre-diced pork and a claim that they were indeed out of pork belly. Got some nice Italian sausages for comparison tho. So, across to Dan Moloney. Not only did they have belly pork but there was a big slab of it on the counter. So maybe I wasn't so nuts thinking Darina's article had caused a bit of interest. I got all my bits and wheezed back out to Old Chapel.

A bit of sage, oregano and thyme from the front garden was cut, white pepper located and then onto the prep. There isn't much to sausages really. A pretty equal mix of lean and fatty pork, up to 20% rusk or breadcrumbs to help texture and reduce leakage, some herbs and spices and not much else. 

[![Image050](http://static.flickr.com/25/60387194_5462d5cd25_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387194/ ""Photo Sharing"")

The sausage casings just need to be soaked in water for a while. I went with hog casings as I was making a big breakfast banger rather than chipolata's. Why is that word only used in the UK? It means nothing over here really.

[![Image051](http://static.flickr.com/30/60387207_efb0152cfa_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387207/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Yet again, apologies for the rubbish photo quality - Catherine had the Ixus so I had to use the Nokia Crap-Cam again.

[![Image049](http://static.flickr.com/29/60387178_e285fc6d7b_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387178/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I had been looking forward to using the mincer attachment and sausage making attachment on the Kenwood Chef since we got it last year. 

[![Image052](http://static.flickr.com/26/60387218_8aa0ee8ef9_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387218/ ""Photo Sharing"")

So I assembled the bits, mixed my sausage mixture and turned it on. I started pushing the mix into the mincer and a few moment later, the minced pork started coming out of the drilled holes. Hurrah, success. And then it stopped. I then spent nearly an hour trying to mince 1 kg of pork. A total disaster. The Kenwood jammed on every tiny piece of fat that it encountered. 

[![Image055](http://static.flickr.com/25/60387266_85941d52e7_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387266/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I tried big holes, little holes, fast speed, slow speed and I re-chopped all the meat into smaller pieces. Eventually I got it all through but at that stage it had the consistency of meat paste.

[![Image054](http://static.flickr.com/26/60387254_afde2ac339_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387254/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I am totally pissed off at Kenwood. What is the point of a feature on a machine if it is not capable of handling the normal standard situation? Grrr.

But undaunted, I moved onto the sausage making phase. The kit for this was easily set up and I clearly remembered everything Ray had said on the course.

[![Image056](http://static.flickr.com/24/60387286_1241cd946c_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387286/ ""Photo Sharing"")

And ye know what? It bloody worked. Not perfect, not neat, not consistent but a sausage all the same.

[![Image057](http://static.flickr.com/32/60387296_6194f86de6_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387296/ ""Photo Sharing"")

And the next bit worked too - even better than the first. I was worried I was underfilling but as it turned out  I was slightly overfilling.

[![Image060](http://static.flickr.com/27/60387349_bb8f6a75b9_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387349/ ""Photo Sharing"")

The one bit I wasn't going to try this time was the method for making all the linked sausages. I understood it on the day of the course  but I didn't have enough length to give it a proper go. So I just squeezed it at various points and twisted to make each sausage. 

[![Image062](http://static.flickr.com/32/60387401_07d3298e55_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387401/ ""Photo Sharing"")

And for the first time in this blog, I get a chance to use Vinnie McCabe's famous phrase. Vinnie was Dean of Engineering in UCD. He did ""Introduction to Engineering"" in first year. In one class he was describing the first bridge he ever designed. He summarised it as ""functional but not aesthetically pleasing"". Till the day I die, I won't forget that perfect phrase. And today it describes my sausages.

Sausages should ideally be left to hang for about 24 hours to let the flavours merge and to let some of the ooze settle. I hung them in the shower for about 8 hours but the stink of the casing was brutal so I wrapped them in grease-proof and put them in the fridge. On Sunday morning I fried them up.

[![Image063](http://static.flickr.com/25/60387417_1f3ca3a24a_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387417/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Mmmmmmm.

[![Image064](http://static.flickr.com/30/60387430_90b69ee434_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387430/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Thirty minutes of gentle cooking later and they were ready. A tomato, some ketchup and some chilli sauce joined them on the plate.

[![Image066](http://static.flickr.com/26/60387450_1a3d79b6a6_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/60387450/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I was a bit tentative with the first bite. But, to my amazement, they were pretty damned fine. Texture was too dense and smooth as expected after the mincing nightmare (more like pate really) but very tasty.  I will definitely add more pepper and herbs the next time as I was overly cautious this time. But all in all a huge success. I'll be doing it again, if I can figure out the Kenwood problems.

We went out with some vendors last night to Isaac's in town. I've often heard it mentioned in the past. It was jammed at 7.30 when we arrived and was still jammed at 9.30 when we left. Fantastic room with great decor and a very nice feel to the place.

Service all night was quite sullen but good and efficient. Slight issue with the booze. Our foreign visitors wanted Guinness and all that was on offer was Henineken or Budweiser Budvar from the Czech Republic. Where were these visitors from? Yup you guessed it.

As all were tired we went straight for main courses. Menu was one of those kitchen sink types with pasta, steak, curry and anything else anyone could ever ask for. Zero sense of a ""style"" of cooking. I went with one of the specials which was john dory on a red pepper sauce. The others went with things across the entire range. My sauce was fine, my side vegetables tasty and my fish overcooked to rubber. Everyone elses looked ok and were all big portions.

Coffees were good.

Average over-priced food. But as I said, they were jammed so well done to them on finding a lucrative niche.

Basically is it a fixed number of people in a fixed number of jobs, moving between those jobs every once in a while?

Join us on the Bandon Half Marathon and 10K,"I was very disappointed to miss the inaugural Bandon 10k last year so there is no way I'm missing the first [Bandon Half Marathon](http://www.bandonhalfmarathon.com/) on May 14th.

[![](http://www.bandonhalfmarathon.com/wp-content/themes/LOP/img/logo.png ""Bandon Half Marathon"")](http://www.bandonhalfmarathon.com/)

My type of running is known, by experts in the field, as walking :-) Last year I did the Courtmacsherry 10k, the Dingle Half-Marathon and the Galway Bay Half-Marathon. All done incredibly slowly and all tough. My dodgy ankle did not help.

My aim for Bandon is to shave at least an hour off my time. It's not going to be easy since the route is pretty challenging due to hills. But that is balanced by the fact that the views are great. TBH I really didn't enjoy the Galway race. Urban running, in traffic, even with sea views, cannot compare to something like the Dingle Peninsula. The Bandon run is in some of the lovely back roads between the Clon road and the Dunmanway road near the river. See below:

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/half-marathon.jpg ""Bandon Half-Marathon Route"")](http://www.bandonhalfmarathon.com/courses/)

If you have never run before, why not go for the 10k route? It's a great way to spend a morning and the pints taste mighty fine afterwards.

I believe the Dingle weekend is their busiest business weekend of the year. Let's hope the same ends up being the case for Bandon.

Hopefully see you on the route. I'll be the mentalist wearing these:

Kilkenny Alive is the future,"I've been saying it non-stop for two years; if your business is not online, you are heading for extinction. I don't care whether you are a butcher, baker or artist, start selling online now. Too difficult or pricey? Check out [these guys](http://shop.venda.com/) or [these guys](http://www.nitrosell.com/).

But more than ""normal"" business, the move of media online is accelerating all the time. Traditional newspapers across the US are going bust and the Voice group in Ireland couldn't get traction. Of course it's still hard to make money online as a media org, particularly with the downturn in advertising revenue. There is a great piece by [Nic Brisbourne here](http://www.theequitykicker.com/2009/02/17/local-advertising-a-market-destroyed-by-the-web/) on the problems with local advertising online. Hell, I've heard the Guardian loses £20m per year on their main site.

But if you can figure it out and can create multiple revenue streams then the opportunities are massive. Local becomes global. Your audience stretches from outside your door to every ex-pat on the planet.

This is the longest lead-in ever to the main point of this post - I'm absolutely thrilled to see the launch of [Kilkenny Alive](http://www.kilkennyalive.com/). It is Ireland's first ever online-only regional newspaper. This is a big deal for local media here. With two fantastic journos as joint-editors and an eager readership looking for an alternative to the same old print warhorses, I think it's going to be a major success story.

![](http://www.kilkennyalive.com/sites/default/files/pp_newswire_logo.jpg ""Kilkenny Alive"")

I am a bit of an early adopter for tech and I only buy maybe one newspaper a month. I get all my news online and by mobile. In fact, I think that the opportunity in mobile will eclipse that of ""desktop online"" in the next few years. The iPhone led the way, Google Android just drives the point home. The old Wap nonsense will fade into history and proper full access to online content on your mobile will be the norm.

I still think the original ireland.com portal model can work at a local level. The main media site in each town and region should the the destination site for anyone looking for any information about that area. The fact that the Bandon Opinion doesn't have _any_ web-site boggles the mind. The [Southern Star](http://www.southernstar.ie/) has one but it still seems to be in old Unison mode.

With great sites, either of those could be the default home page for every person living in West Cork or interested in it. Every tourist who looks up West Cork should end up there booking accommodation, reading restaurant [reviews](http://business.loudervoice.com/), finding events, reading the news and watching videos of local games. (Revenue model idea - charge people a few euro to watching [streaming video](http://www.ustream.tv/) of hurling games internationally and rev-share with the local clubs). They should be the one-stop-shop for everything in the region. My hope is that Kilkenny Alive wants to be that site for the South East.

Well done to Sean, Jim and everyone in Kilkenny Alive, I look forward to getting all the latest from KK in my [RSS reader](http://google.com/reader)."

"Killarney, Land of the Celtic Tiger's Aran Sweater","After Caroline's wedding, we hung on for another day in Killarney to get a break from our four darlings. I think maybe I had passed through once before but could remember nothing of the place so I had no expectations. OK, I did assume we would find a certain level of paddywhackery but jesus, it turned out to be Brigadoon transplanted.

I have never ever seen so many shops selling such tat in all my life. They make the shops in the streets around Notre Dame look like high quality purveryors of  objets d'art. I could have dressed as a full leprechaun in any of about thirty shops. 

[![Image046](http://static.flickr.com/27/58653895_d2a038e10a_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/58653895/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I had thought that the older generation of Irish-American immigrants had started dying out or at least were getting too old to travel. So I assumed the demand for this sort of ""darby o'gill and the little people"" ""top o da mornin to ya"" shite had died off. I was obviously wrong. These shops wouldn't be selling this rubbish unless someone was buying it.

There are signs of hope. The Murphy's Coffee and Ice Cream shop is a branch of the one in Dingle (sorry I of course meant An Dingle Dangle Dongle Ui Cuis) and serves fab stuff. And there is, em, well, em, oh yeah, the factory outlet mall and the, oh ye know, the, eh, gimme a sec, the, of course, the Supermacs in the garage.

I did realise there that there is one opportunity being missed by all the pub chains operating on the continent. One of them needs to open an Irish Pub - in Ireland!

Knife Sharpening Fetish,"I have a small obsession with getting my knives very sharp. I think it goes back to my uncle Frank who is a carpenter and who showed me how he sharpened his chisels on a wet-stone when I was a very small kid. From that point on, I was always trying to sharpen knives. I think my first attempt was using Frank's wet-stone on a butter knife. The outcome on that one was very predictable.

Then, as a cub and scout for eight years, I tried everything to get my Swiss Army sharp to no avail. I mainly tried using stones. Total waste of time. I did actually buy a wet-stone in my early teens but had no idea how to use it:

[![bc8](http://static.flickr.com/29/42378499_1e94d5a2ba_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/42378499/ ""Photo Sharing"")

As I got older and into my twenties, the obsession moved to kitchen knives. I tried and failed to use a standard steel a bit like this Wusthof:

[![CL_4474-26cm honing](http://static.flickr.com/28/42377101_d45558ac3e_o.gif)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/42377101/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Then I got the classic Kitchen Devils ""mini crossed steels"" sharpener. I think this was the first one where I actually got a result. The knives were never razor sharp but they were always able to do a reasonable job.

Then I hit the motherlode with the rotating disk sharpener (also from Kitchen Devils I think). This baby finally gave me what I was looking for - bloody sharp knives (in every sense of bloody). The only down-side was that it didn't seem to sharpen all knives and after a while it stopped sharpening altogether (later I would discover that this is due to the build up of metal on the ceramic which can be cleaned off):

[![rollsharp_th](http://static.flickr.com/32/42384240_8fd69c06f7_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/42384240/ ""Photo Sharing"")

So things were on the up-and-up but of course I was never satisfied. Then a few years back I was in the Ballymaloe shop and  found this beauty:

[![IMG_1447](http://static.flickr.com/30/42266745_d9d012fe9e_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/42266745/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I've been using it for three or four years now. The big advantage it has is the presence of two grades of ceramic. The rough one to create a basic edge on something very blunt and a finer one to hone a knife that has just lost sharpness. It's always worked well but suffered the same metal build-up and it was nigh on impossible to scrub off the metal due to its shape. But there were two bigger problems - firstly it was getting more and more difficult to keep an edge on knives even for a day or two and secondly it seemed to be creating very rough pitted edges on the knives.

Recently I decided to do a bit of further reading and discovered this excellent foodie web-site:

[eG Forums (The eGullet Society for Culinary Arts and Letters)](http://forums.egullet.com/).

They have a[ fantastic guide to knife sharpening](http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?act=ST&f=108&t=26036&) and cover all the issues involved. The ideal for them is a sharpening-stone but that requires too much skill for my liking. The best alternatives are the angled ceramic sharpeners. The rotating disk ones that I had used are like crude mini-versions of these but damage the blade too much. 

One that seemed to get good recommendations was the [Spyderco Sharpmaker 204](http://spyderco.com/catalog/details.php?product=77). I took a browse over to [New Graham Knives](http://www.newgraham.com/sharpmaker.htm) in the US who were also recommended. They were selling it for $46.81 including instructional DVD. How could I pass up a bargain like that? A quick check to see that they would ship to Ireland and I put in my order. They shipped the following day and I got it in less than a week. Well impressed!

I did grin when I opened the package as out fell a box of plasters with the byline ""because you'll need them"".

I did the first few knives without watching the DVD and was happy with the results but not blown away. Then I watched the DVD and saw where I was making a few mistakes. I took my favourite chef's knife (actually a cheap all-metal one from Marks and Sparks) and ran it through the four-stage 160 stroke process. I pressed the edge of it with my thumb and goddammed cut myself! I could not believe it. I've only ever cut myself by running a knife along flesh.This thing is now literally razor-sharp. When done right, the resulting knife will cut paper without any pressure.

So after a long, emotional and spiritual journey of over thirty years, I have now reached nirvana and will be happily slicing soft tomatoes with my lethal weapons until my hands no longer work.

Finally, some pictures of my pride and joy:

Learn about Twitter whilst having a nice glass of vino,"I know the whole [Twitter](http://twitter.com) thing is still completely alien to a lot of people. How many wondered what the hell the papers were on about when discussing Dan Boyle's ""[tweet](http://twitter.com/sendboyle/status/9245275419)""?

Here's a suggestion for dipping your toe in and getting a handle on it all. [Karwig Wines](http://www.karwigwines.ie) in Carrigaline is running the third ""Twebt"" which is a Twitter wine-tasting competition ([Bubble Brothers](http://www.bubblebrothers.com/) and [Curious Wines](http://www.curiouswines.ie/) ran the first two).

The idea is very simple. You get a bottle of wine from Joe and his gang in Karwig's and it is wrapped up so you can't see the label. At an agreed time, 9pm Sunday March 7th, people open the wine and start tasting it and putting their tasting notes up on Twitter.Then they start guessing the country, grape etc and maybe even the exact wine.

It's a bit of fun and those taking part range from gurus to tipplers and everyone in between.

Full details on taking part are on [Brian Clayton's Blog](http://brianclayton.ie/twebt/) and on the [Karwig's Blog](http://www.karwigwines.ie/pc/Twebt-Mystery-Bottle-2p394.htm).

Leaving Advanticus,"Sadly, as of Tuesday, I am no longer part of Advanticus Technologies.

Let's all brainstorm silently,"Damn, double damn and blast. Catherine pointed out that there is now a series on satellite called ""The Apprentice, Martha Stewart"". 

Now that's just not fair, two phrases in one title to draw the moth into the flame. Not only do they have a series which is guaranteed to have at least 80% nut-jobs, morons and chancers on it, but then they build it around the wicked witch of the west, the anti-Darina, beelzeebubina, Martha Magdalene Stewart.

And what utter perfection in TV it is. Martha, the woman who tells middle America how to dress, cook, eat and live is looking for a sidekick. Her current ones are a mouthy slaphead who permanently has a ridiculous unlit cigar in his mouth and a woman whose only function appears to be sitting silently looking petrified of the camera.

As it is a US programme, the contestents scrub up a little better than the scrubbers on the UK one. One of the project leaders this week clearly modelled herself on Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. She is an event organiser who, when ideas were not forthcoming from her team, told them all to brainstorm silently.

Their attemps to create a buzz around the handy pocket sized stain remover ""Tide to Go"" were hilarious and it means that the swines have me hooked. I can't wait for the week when hopefully the steroid enhanced bloke goes head to head against the Madge-inspired muscle-rippling woman.

And Martha, oh Martha. A stare on her like a medusa. No matter how hard she tries to sound nice, you know she'd knife you if you got in her way.

"Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something.","We don't have it too bad for restaurants down here in Cork. We've had great meals in Gleesons in Clonakilty, Casino House in Kilbrittain and Broly's in Bandon.

Unfortunately most of the places in Bandon target the lower end of the Market and it's nice to see Broly's trying something better. It is a coffee shop/cafe during the day and they re-jig for more upmarket dinner at night. Good tasty food. I hope they do well but it was empty the night we were there before Christmas.

Other places in Bandon we've tried; Roccos - not too bad mid-ish-range place. Overuse of microwaves tho. Sorrento - very average Italian but the kids liked it.

Takeaways in Bandon (all sit-down too): Anarkali Indian - one of the better Indians around. Ho Kee Chinese - pretty average. Rainbow Chinese - started well, degenerated very quickly. Hong Kong - not bad (used to have a fantastic name ""Memories of China"", why change it to something so utterly crap?)

[Gleeson's](http://www.gleesons.ie/) has given us some great meals over the last two years but the last meal was a let down - just lacking in flavour. The service by Alex and her team is always top class and extremely friendly.

Casino House got voted [best restaurant in Ireland](http://www.ireland-guide.com/awards/2.asp) by Georgina Campbell which tells you everything you need to know - fabulous food in an awesome setting. Proving that being situated in the middle of no-where is no disadvantage if the food is good enough.

Our most recent expedition was into Cork City to eat at [Les Gourmandises](http://www.lesgourmandises.ie/aboutus.htm) in Cook St (always makes me smile - where else would you have a restaurant? Also the barber on Sheare Street still causes a grin). I first heard of these in the RTE program last year about small businesses starting up. They had a baptism of fire but their commitment to the food shone through the program. I got a voucher for de wimmin in Passage to go there recently and they raved about it. So it was about time we checked it out.

The starters were both excellent. Very tasty, great attention to detail. My Red Snapper main was fabulous. Catherine not a huge fan of her Pork Belly but there was nothing really wrong with it, it just didn't suit her. We should probably have swapped plates. Desserts were good but not enough chocolate sauce on Catherines. When will restaurants learn? When a woman orders a chocolate dessert, she does not want to be short-changed. If sauce is involved, bring out a jug of it. None of this ""dab here"" ""dab there"" nonsense. Service was efficient and very discreet. Not cheap tho - ?106 for two with just half a bottle of wine. But we'll definitely be back.

Where is left to try in Cork? Cafe Paradiso obviously. Need to go back to Jacobs on The Mall. The Ivory Tower was just a bit too kooky for the sake of it to build up any loyalty. And we have a voucher for [Otto's in Dunworley](http://ottos-creative-catering.com/) from CandT which we will use very soon. What sort of nutter sets up a restaurant 20 Km from anywhere down a windy headland in West Cork? And then makes a huge success of it? Bloody genius."
Like a fine wine,"In a change from our usual programming here at Bandon HQ, I kicked off a light-hearted conversation on Twitter earlier about great looking women who just get better and better with age (we also covered men).

Live Pre-packed Mussels - Genius Idea,"I popped into the fish shop in Bantry today and spotted these. A fully sealed pack of live local mussels. I have long lamented the lack of fresh shellfish in shops in Cork and now they have no excuse. All you need is a cooler cabinet with no need for special shellfish expertise or having to deal with smells or things going off. These could literally be sold in every garage and convenience shop in the country.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20032010857-300x225.jpg ""20032010857"")](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20032010857.jpg)

Not only is it easier for shops but mussels are the ultimate fast food. All I did this evening was open the pack, rinse them, throw out the ones that were still open and cook them. Cooking consisted of chopping some garlic and onion, cooking that for a sec, lobbing in a ton of wine, one more minute, lob in the mussels, 4 minutes, add some cream, serve. Probably less that 15 minutes from taking pack out of fridge to eating my dinner.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20032010860-300x225.jpg ""20032010860"")](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20032010860.jpg)

And wow were these fresh. I could still smell and taste that seaside ozone without a hint of fishiness.

Demand these from every shop you frequent that limits itself to selling fish fingers."
LJK Passes Away,"I was gutted to read in CAR that LJK Setright passed away recently. I started reading CAR when I was 14 years old and continue to do so despite his absence for the past few years.

As a kid, I checked out most of the motoring magazines and CAR was the only one I read where I felt I was learning something, rather than just reading pseudo-ads. For a short while in the late 80's I tried Performance Car but to be honest that was only because of Clarkson. I can happily claim to have spotted his future greatness whilst still in my teens. The letters page every month were filled with missives from indignant middle-Englanders who were scandalised by his digs at everything they held dear. 

But Clarkson was just naughty and after a while I returned to the more thoughtful bosom of CAR, and more importantly, to LJK's monthly column. Each month I worked my way through it and understood about half of it. His breadth and depth of knowledge was extraordinary, with many literary references and tons of Latin (all of which went straight over my head due to giving up Latin for Classical Studies in 2nd Year in Kierans!). I learned more about cars from his one page each month than from the rest of the magazine.

LJK was arrogant, pompous and usually right. This is a man who argued engine cylinder design with Honda's Nobuhiko Kawamoto, who argued that there were distinct advantages to smoking, and who, most of all, argued that speed does not, in fact, kill. And for that, I loved every word the man wrote.

Last year I bought the last book he wrote: ""Drive On! A Social History of the Motor Car"". As I am averaging two book completions a year right now, I have only read a few chapters. But this is a masterpiece of erudition, history, opinion, insight and humour. To many people, a car is simply an appliance whose main contribution to the world is pollution. This book shows how so much of who we are and how we live our lives comes from the motor car. And the critical thing is that most of its effect are to our benefit. It's a heavy read (as were all his CAR articles) but you'll feel that you understand the world just a little bit better as you go through it.

I felt that the obituary in CAR was a sad reflection of what has happened to that magazine. In the past, they would have articles running to twenty pages or more. Phil Llewellin (who sadly also died recently) specialised in articles like that. As a young-fella, I did find many of them overly wordy but now I see what the alternative  is - every article stripped to 2 pages for the ADD-addled Max Power generation. No depth, no analysis, barely time for the specs. They gave two pages to Setright, one of which was a picture (and what a unique style the man had!). He deserved half the entire issue.

Here are a few links to obituaries:

[The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/news/2005/09/17/db1702.xml). [The Independent](http://motoring.independent.co.uk/features/article313713.ece).  [Pacific Motorsport](http://www.nzmotorsport.co.nz/content/newsarticle.cfm?pLive&id=6025).

I'll finish with two quotes from the great man:

On the Citroën GS in 1971: 

""According to Voltaire, 'the secret of art is to improve on nature'. It is a peculiarly French attitude, one that is manifested as much in their engineering as in their graphic, plastic or musical artefacts. In their automotive engineering it is especially apparent...""

And most famously, Setright on speed limits:

""Apart from tax evasion, there should logically be one and only one motoring offence: dangerous driving... If what one does (even if one does 150mph) is not actually dangerous, then it does not matter what it is, nor what other people think. It is then no business of other people - not if this is, as we used to think, a free country.""

I'm going to miss that man.

Local Business Support,"I've done a post over [on our business blog](http://www.argolon.com/2008/07/24/west-cork-enterprise-board-support/) about the supports offered to local business by [West Cork Enterprise Board](http://www.wceb.ie/). If you are based in the region, it's well worth reading. The highlights are:

*   6 hour IT Consultancy for €150 via Tech-Check
*   Feasibility Study Grants up to €5100
*   International Trade Show Attendance Grants up to €2000
*   Ecommerce Web-site development Grants up to €1500
That last one is absolutely brilliant. If you are making any sort of product (I'm thinking crafts and food in West Cork) that could also be sold by mail order, you'd be nuts not to avail of it. Note that the grants are all done on the basis of ""matching funds""."
Irish Lockdown Vegan Brown Soda Bread recipe,"![Brown Bread](/images/2020/06/brown_bread.jpg)

In January 2020, I went 99.9% plant-based as a way of kick-starting serious weight loss after 20 years of being either overweight or obese. The only initial exception was cow milk in my tea. I did similar back in 2016 but that was my silly ""6 Day Vegan"" plan where I ate chicken curry on a Friday. Both times I've used [Veganuary](https://uk.veganuary.com/) as the starting point.

After two months at 99.9%, I took the leap and dropped all dairy too. So now, apart from the very rare finger dip in a brownie or other lockdown treats that the kids make, I'm effectively 100% plant-based. I'm not saying I'll do it forever but I'm honestly finding it very easy and almost never miss meat or dairy. I play a lot with meat substitutes but that's more to do with texture and familiarity than wanting it to necessarily taste like meat. My [Beyond Meat](https://www.beyondmeat.com/products/the-beyond-burger/) burger stack is a thing of beauty.

I'll do more posts on the subject soon but suffice to say that it's 10x easier to go vegan in 2020 than in 2016. There's a massive new range of vegan and vegetarian options even in rural Irish SuperValu supermarkets. Huge kudos to Ireland's [Denny](https://www.denny.ie/food/meat-free-range/) on their sausages, burgers and mince. All are superb. Birdseye are also doing a good range of [""Green Cuisine""](https://www.birdseye.co.uk/range/meat-free-mealtimes/green-cuisine) but they do need to do some work on texture/taste. [Non-dairy yoghurts](http://schullandcrossbones.ie/) are pretty much indistinguishable from dairy. And [Violife](https://violifefoods.com/) are doing some very good cheese alternatives. Their feta in particular is fantastic. They just need more tang and crumbliness in all of their products. Our goto milks are [Oatly Barista Edition](https://www.oatly.com/int/products/oat-drink-barista-edition) and [Minor Figures](https://minorfigures.com/) oat milks. And there is always a range of [Quorn](https://www.quorn.ie/products/roast-style-sliced-fillets) products in the fridge and freezer for those quick protein needs.

Now here we are near the end of June and I've lost 38lbs/17kg so far this year with no let-up in sight. Of course being mostly off booze has helped a lot too, but previous booze-free attempts have never had this impact. My cholesterol, blood pressure and BMI (obvs) have also all plummeted.

Sorry, you were looking for a bread recipe?

Right.

Yes I've also been doing the sourdough thing. My starter is now very strong and I do one big loaf a week using the ""no-knead dutch oven"" method based on info from [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWbl3Sr2y1Y) and [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/no-knead-sourdough-bread-recipe) in the US. But that's not what this post is about.

My mother's brown bread is legendary and is sent to fans far and wide. But it is a traditional one involving buttermilk and eggs. I knew I had zero hope of replicating its perfection in vegan-form as no one has been able to, even following her original recipe to the letter. There's magic in those Ratoath fingers.

So I took a range of recipes online and started playing with them. This version has been working well for me for months now, even if I'm finding the initial wetness seems very variable, so I can't give a definitive cooking time.

Start by pre-heating your oven to 200C fan and (optionally oiling) a standard silicone or metal bread loaf tin.

Mix together the following dry ingredients very well first:

(March 2021 Note: I'm still making this twice a week. I continue to adjust and tweak. I have updated some of the amounts since I originally wrote this and indicated the changes below)

* 200g plain white flour
* 150g wholemeal flour (I have used both coarse and fine ground but prefer coarse)
* A ""shake"" of each of the following to get your total weight to approx 575g-600g (originally 450-550g). A shake is approx 2-3 tbsp. I'd only consider the wheat germ, wheat bran and pinhead oatmeal mandatory.
    * Wheatgerm
    * Wheatbran
    * Milled flaxseed
    * Sprouted milled flaxseed
    * Chia seed (milled or whole)
    * Pinhead oatmeal
    * Poppy seeds
    * Hemp seeds
    * Pumpkin seeds
    * Any other tasty seeds or oatmeal etc
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tsp baking soda / bread soda / bicarbonate of soda (not baking powder)(originally 1 tsp)

Mix the following in a jug, it's ok if it splits:

* 350ml of oatmilk or other plant-based milk (originally 300ml)
* 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (originally 1 tbsp)

Add the liquid to the dry mix along with 2 tbsp of maple syrup or other sweetness. I now also add 1 tsp of blackstrap molasses (black treacle).

Mix well with a spatula. It should be pretty loose, not a tight ball, and flow easily into the loaf tin. You may need to tweak milk amounts depending on the flours and type of milk you use.

Sprinkle sesame seeds or pumpkin seeds all over the top and pat it into the mix with the spatula.

Cut a deep line along the length in the middle of the mix with a knife. 

Pop it into the oven for between 45 mins and an hour. I'm finding an hour is currently optimal in our oven. Check at 40 to ensure it's not burning and to check the brownness. I use a K-type thermocouple to try and get a relatively accurate temperature in the oven but it varies hugely.

Maybe rotate once during the cooking time if you have an inconsistent oven like ours.

Pop out of the tin onto a cooling rack for 30 mins or so.

Eat.

If you find it's a bit damp in the middle, just increase the cook time on the next attempt."

Looks like Saturday was a success,"After all my encouragement to go to Saturday's Bandon Farmer's Market I ended up missing it myself. I got up a bit late and had to get ready for our weekend in Rosslare. I ended up squeezed for time and didn't want to be shopping hassled. So, I headed off with the four angels and left Catherine to plant the garden and paint the loo. Result? Garden good, loo baaaaaadddddd. We're not quite in marriage counselling but that red has to go.

Back to the topic at hand; Catherine popped down to the market between 1.30 and 2.00 to see what treats were remaining to be had. Some of the stalls were nearly sold out and all the others seemed to have been doing great business! I am really thrilled for all the vendors that the interest has held up. Any vendors reading this who want to report on numbers? Looks like arriving early is the best way to get what you want.
Catherine then popped down to Clon for some awful wall paint and popped into Lettercollum. They were sold out of their fab quiches and pies too. Bummer for Cath but another sign that quality sells.

Happily for her, I returned today with all children alive and in possession of their limbs and bearing gifts of Eves Pud and Lemon Cake from my awesome mother. Let me tell ya, eating and typing at the same time is tough.

Looks like the hamster is going to be ok,"[All reports seem to indicate](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5372890.stm) that Richard Hammond is well on the mend which is a big relief to any fan of Top Gear. 

Related to this, I noticed something very interesting on the BBC web-site over the past few days when checking up on him. All of the headlines are obviously decided by editors and news experts and reflect what they think are the pressing issues of the day e.g. various Iranian or Venezuelan numbskulls embarassing their nations at the UN or the genuinely important Darfur and so on. Nowhere in the headlines, after the first announcement, has Hammond been mentioned.

But if you scrolled down to the section on ""most read"" or ""most emailed"", it is stories about Hammond that have been number one for the past three days! It really highlights the huge difference between what we ""should"" be interested in and what we actually are interested in. 

Those of you familiar with [Digg](http://www.digg.com/) know that it is a news site where the top stories are dictated by how many votes they get from the users. They are sometimes accused by ""our betters"" as pandering to the mob mentality and you often do get nonsense stories as the top ones of the day but what I have always found interesting about Digg is that it generally is a strong reflection of the important stories of the day as agreed on mainstream tech news sites too. So the mob mentality works a lot of the time. I guess it is a variation of the theme of that book ""[The Wisdom of Crowds](http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/)""(which I really should read).

Whilst I'm not saying the BBC should dump their editors (well actually they should fire all the ones who insist on the use of inverted commas around any phrase that might be considered controversial: ""terrorist"", ""mass murderer"", ""totalitarian dictator"", ""king""), they might consider making one of the headline boxes a display for the most popular story over a 4/8/12/24 hour period. News for the people by the people.

I guess that is why I am such a fan of blogs and RSS feeds - I can subscribe to sites that feed me information that I am interested in and by taking a reasonable cross-section, I end up with a fairly rich view of certain topics and stories. 

My issue with general news sites (not just the BBC) is that I don't have the tools yet to filter the torrent of stories they push out and I can neither keep up with nor have interest in 90% of that information. A news feed which monitors my reading and filters based on what I have read historically would be a very powerful tool indeed.

Lovely lunch in Italistro,"Thrilled to find a nice new local place with good tasty well-priced unpretentious food which I think will suit our family perfectly. I've also heard good things from several others.

Italistro opened several months ago and immediately caught my eye because, despite being on a street I rarely visit, they advertised on the side of the building in their lovely brand colours and I see it every time I go through town. However months passed and I still hadn't tried it.

Today I went for lunch with two of the cool Newsweaver people, Denise and Jennifer and decided to check it out. The decor and colour scheme really catch your eye, they've done a superb job. I had been worried about them doing sit-down and takeaway but the areas are separated well.

There was no-one there at 12.45 for lunch which surprised me. We got the lunch menus and I saw a lot I'd be happy having. A good general mix of pasta, pizza, burgers, chicken etc. One thing leaped off the page for me, a meatball/mozzarella/salami pannini. I bloody love meatballs so I had to have it. The others picked pizzas.

The food took quite a while to arrive but where pizza is involved I'm happy to wait. My pannini hit the spot, yum! The price had originally seemed high to me at €9.50 but when the plate arrived with a full bowl of chips and a big bowl of proper salad and tasty dressing, I realised it was a bargain. Reports on the pizzas were good too and they looked gorgeous. We finished off with some good coffees in very sexy cups.

The lack of custom worried me but I was assured it is hoppin at night which I was happy to hear. We have to get our childer fed and watered on Friday before we head off for a quick night away and I'm definitely heading down to Italistro with them.

Bandon is just getting better and better for food. Now all we need is Yo Sushi to open and I'll be a very happy bunny."

Malt House Granary shows to to fill a restaurant in a recession,"We were recently taken out to dinner by my parents and decided to try the Malt House Granary in Clonakilty. We had only been once before, 5 years ago, and had not liked the heavy food. But[ a recent review](http://www.loudervoice.com/reviews/59854179) which highlighted the new ownership made us want to try again. And oh boy were we glad we did.

We like eating very early and sat down at 7.30 to a totally empty restaurant which had me worried. I needn't have. By 9pm they were turning people away at the door.

The menu is a great mix of local produce with a strong focus on fish and shellfish. Finally a  restaurant in West Cork that offers something other than 5 different types of white fish!

As with other great meals I have had recently (like in Fenn's Quay), I'll let the pictures do the talking below. In summary, superb cooking with fantastic deep savoury flavours and a lightness of touch.

The portion sizes were on the overly-large size but the value was amazing. Where most places seem to try and get €22+ for mains, they were mid-teens for almost everything. We all raved about the food but were bursting at the seams as we left. We agreed that a main+coffee would make a fantastic early quick filling dinner for little more than you'd pay in a thousand crappy restaurants all over Ireland.

On the drive back through Clon we spotted several other restaurants that looked almost empty. If they want to stay in business, they should study what Elaine McCarthy and her team are doing in the Malt House Granary. It's simple to say but hard to do: ""fantastic fresh food, cooked with skill and sold with value in mind"".

I think I've found my new favourite fish restaurant in Ireland. Yes it is that good."
Man Friday not so Hot on Monday,"I was recently out on a business dinner with some Dutch customers to ""Man Fridays"" in Kinsale. This appears to be one of the most famous restaurants in Kinsale and is nestled in a fabulous location overlooking the harbour. Parking in that part of Kinsale was, as ever, a nightmare. I eventually strapped two dinghys to my car and moored it off the promenade.

Overall I was very disappointed with the food but the Dutch guys loved it, so go figure. It is strictly old-school with very heavy-handed dishes and massive portions. But it was jammed on a Monday night in October so they clearly know their clientele.

One of the guys rated his creme brulee as the best he has ever eaten. But then this is from a race of people who's favourite snack is [kroket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroket). Imagine a potato croquette but filled with a puree of meat-offcuts.  Imagine a giant big......no, forget that, it'll put you off your tea. 

They always slather them in mustard, presumably to kill both the taste and the smell.

It looks a little bit like this:

![kroket](http://static.flickr.com/5/5315865_6233dbd80a_m_d.jpg)

So in summary; Man Friday's - the best restaurant for kroket lovers in Ireland. 

If you do visit the Netherlands, don't forget to ask ""Zijn er ook bitterballen?""."

Which was the nicest? Yup, the 2 year old's. After the horror of watching them ""knead"" the dough and drop it on the floor several times, the two little gits ended up with far superior results because [a] they were not swimming in sauce and [b] the were wafer thin cos I only gave them a small bit of dough each. Mine was more like a soup on a bap. All tasted fantastic tho.

Marmatiece was opened a few weeks ago by the folks who used to run Roco's until they closed late last year. We headed out last night for a sort of Father's day treat for me and to see what it was like. I went in with a slight bias as I never thought Roco's was much good. They have the dubious honour of serving me the worst risotto I've ever had. But the buzz about Marmatiece was good and I always like to support local business.

It is on the quay looking out on the Bandon river and it is great to see the river finally being embraced (the original design of the town has all of the buildings with their back to the river). Outside, the restaurant looks a bit dark but inside is fabulous. They clearly got a great interior designer to do the room. I loved it - bright, airy, mix of wood and tiled floors, interesting art and sculpture on the walls, lovely looking chairs. And I just loved the special corner table: 

[![Nice Corner Table](http://static.flickr.com/78/169476960_840bb1c88f.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/169476960/ ""Photo Sharing"")

The menu was short which I like and it looked like pretty standard mid-range fare with plenty of things which suited me. The wine list was weird tho. They call themselves a restaurant and wine-bar but they only have 8 or 9 whites and the same number of reds. That makes zero sense. And all of the wine was low end stuff priced below the level they were pitching the food at. We got a Pinot Grigio at about €21 which was grand and one of the most expensive ones on the list. I am a huge fan of good value in wine but the list needs to be extended.

Salad starters were both good. I wasn't fond of the veg in the timbale but overall it was decent and the dressing and salami were both excellent. Catherine really enjoyed hers and we both thought the onions with capers was really spot on.

Catherine didn't really enjoy her rolled plaice stuffed with crab but I thought my chicken on a chorizo mash was very good. Side veg were decent but the spuds had a crust on them from the heat lamp.

Her tiramisu was very good but my ""Panna Cotta"" was brutal. It was a heavy dense mousse, not a pannacotta which should be holding on to solidity by willpower alone. I couldn't finish it.

This is a place that deserves success - the food is good tasty fare executed well and could easily rise to being excellent as time goes on. The room is fabulous and the service isn't bad - lacking a bit in personality and it was tough to get the bill. I really think they will do well, despite the mental name :-) They were nearly full as we were leaving. Just add some more wines and learn how to spell risotto.

Open from 12-3pm Mon-Fri, Dinner 6-10pm Sun-Sat. Closed Monday evening. Call them on 023-42715.

On the way home we noticed that The Bandon River Grill (based where Roco's used to be) was closed. I really do hope they have not failed after such a short period of time (they only opened at Easter). Does anyone know? I'll be very disappointed if it is true - I wanted to check out their lunch burger menu which sounded excellent.

Matthew Roberts,"More top class baby news from the Roberts'. Matthew Roberts was born 5th March, weighing in at 6lb 6oz. After a rough few days, the wee blighter is thriving. Sleep deprivation, sore nipples and post-natal hair loss are the order of the day, but lucklily that's just Frank, Helen is doing great."
Meatballs in Tomato Sauce,"Update 19/09/2005: I had left out a few steps on this originally, so I'm re-publishing.

I have a recipe for Meatballs with Tomato Sauce which is based mainly on Sophie Grigson's recipe in her  Meat Course  Book. That is one of the best Cookbooks of the past few years but sadly is out of print now. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's  River Cottage Meat Book  is a pretty good alternative for carnivores. My family rave about this meal when I cook it and I have to admit to being partial to it myself. All of the amounts are approximate (use your judgement).

For the Meatballs:
2 lbs minced beef
1 lb sausages
3 tbs milk
1 egg
2 slices white pan (crusts removed)
parsley to taste  (couple of tbs chopped)
6 cloves garlic minced (or more if you like)

For the sauce:
5 cans plum tomatoes
basil to taste (loads!)
parsley to taste (couple of tbs chopped)
3 cloves garlic minced (or more if you like)
1 tbs red wine vinegar

Extra Virgin Olive Oil (I prefer Filippo Berrio)

To make the sauce:
Cover the bottom of a medium pan with the oil and put on medium heat
Add 3 cloves of&nbsp; the garlic. Cook gently for a few moments but do not let it get brown
Add all of the tomatoes
Cook down gently for 20-30 mins breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon
Add parsley about half way
When it is well broken down, add red wine vinegar
cook a few minutes more
Check acidity - add sugar to taste to soften it. This varies with every can of tomatoes.

Meanwhile

To make the meatballs:
Add bread to milk in a bowl and soak for a few mins
Peel sausages (or use sausagemeat) and add to a large bowl
Add minced beef, soaked bread and egg
Add the rest of the garlic
Add a good pile of parsley
Season well with salt and pepper
If you are very anal, cook a bit of this mix in a pan, check the seasoning and adjust.
Mix together very well by hand
Make the balls from this to whatever size you like (golf-ball is a good compromise).
Add oil to a frying pan and apply medium to high heat
Brown the meatballs well in batches so that they are well cooked on the outside.
Do not over-fill the pan or the meatballs will not get a nice dark colour
Add cooked meatballs to the tomato sauce and cook for another fifteen minutes or so.
Add water if sauce has gone too thick   
A few minutes before the end, add tons of basil and then add salt/pepper to taste.

Serve with spaghetti and loads of freshly grated parmesan.

Notes:
There are a million tomato sauce recipes. Use whatever you prefer e.g. add onion or oregano or red wine or whatever. I just like this simple one in this case.

I'm sure I've forgotten something above so don't blame me if it is kak."

Michael O'Leary is my hero,"Just watch him [take apart this Panorama interviewer](http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_8298000/8298750.stm). It'll be impossible for me to take the show on the BBC tonight seriously.

[![oleary](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/oleary.png ""oleary"")](http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_8298000/8298750.stm)

He is not only hysterically funny but completely accurate too. Flying Ryanair is simple, you make yourself aware of the rules and work within them. I don't think I've ever paid more than €60 for a Ryanair return flight. Treat it as a bus, set your expectations correctly and you'll find them the perfect short-haul operator."
Mickey D's - From not bad to bloody hell,"We pop in to McDonald's in Roscrea on most trips from Bandon to Cavan. It is about half way and the kids are usually starving at that stage. It's a wee bit small and parking is a hassle but it is one of the best run ones in the country. They have one of those ""helper"" people permanently on the floor mainly doing clean-up but also offering to mind kids if you need to order the food or go to the loo. The food is fine and the place is always spotless.

On the way back from LondonDerry (how much trouble am I in for writing that :-) ) we were targeting McD's in Athlone which isn't as good as Roscrea but is usually fine. But Fionn couldn't wait that long and we pit-stopped at the one in Cavan. We've been in it several times before and it has never really impressed. Always feels like there is no-one really in control. This time was shockingly bad. The place was empty on arrival so all of the staff were chatting. The young-fella who took the order was fine - and he was the highlight.

The baby high-chairs were filthy. I dropped some fries on the floor on the way to the table and they stayed in full view of all for the entire meal. The mens toilets were filthy and had no toilet roll. I also didn't see a cleaning schedule pinned up anywhere. No cleaning was done in the main seating area for our entire visit. Bloody awful. Was there even a manager on duty?
This McD's is usually very busy and my guess is that they have come to the conclusion that they don't need to try to excel at all since the business comes in anyway. A recipe for disaster. This is exactly the reason that McDonald's as a corporation got into so much trouble. They raced towards the bottom of the market, concentrating entirely on cost and forgetting that they need to keep customers happy. It is the same mistake Dell are making with the corner-cutting on quality at the moment and I've a feeling RyanAir are also going to hit a tipping point where customers say ""no more"". But this will probably not be until Michael O'Leary decides to transport cattle in the main cabin along with people.

I heard a fantastic quote on ""[The Restaurant Guys](http://www.restaurantguysradio.com/sle/rg/)"" podcast last week (well worth listening to these guys) where they repeated an old saying: ""In the restaurant business, if you are not getting better, you are getting worse"". I think that applies to all business.

I know I'm only talking about fast food but McD's really seemed to be getting their act together recently. Good coffee, nice variations on burgers, some variety in the Happy Meals. Let's hope Cavan is just one bad franschisee and not a trend.

On a side note, after the hell of the Maxol Coffee we stopped in Supermacs in Fermoy so Catherine could change Fionn. This is another place that always looks dirty but to be fair to them, the service was excellent, the chicken tenders were genuinely tasty (real chicken, possibly from Ulan Bator but real chicken all the same) and the coffeee was good. Their adult loos were fine but the changing area for babies was flithy.

Oh god, am I turning into the Sunday World's Pub Spy? Is that newspaper column still going?

Whilst I am at it, any recommendations for Child friendly places to stop on the N62-N55 that are not too close to Cork or Cavan. Needs to be speedy, have clean loos, child-changing facilities, better food than McD's, not require a detour and be helpful if you do have four monsters. I don't ask for much do I ;-)

Mint didn't leave me feeling refreshed,"An unsatisfying mix of excellent food and wine with haphazard service and crazy pricing. The most expensive meal we're ever had but sadly not the best.

Regular readers of the blog know that I was blown away by the documentary on Dylan McGrath getting his Michelin star for Mint. When my parents gave me a 40th birthday present of a meal for two there, I was gobsmacked and couldn't wait to go. We finally got there last weekend and left a few hours later confused and unsatisfied.

Mint is based in what I think used to be a fish shop/deli in Ranelagh in Dublin. Whilst Ranelagh has moved on from it's Chew n Chat and Pat Grace's Famous Fried Chicken roots, it still feels like student-land to me. First impressions on arriving at the restaurant were poor since they have kept the old crappy shop-door that you'd expect to see in a Qik-E-Mart.

The rest of this review will mention Petrus here and there. Why? Because it is also a Michelin starred restaurant, the bill was lower and it was the best dining experience of our lives.

We were greeted and seated at a table that was precisely 6 inches from the one next to it. We may as well have sat in the laps of the people next to us since we could hear every word, and vice versa. Of all the problems with the meal, the room is one of the worst. It's simply unacceptable for a restaurant that charges these prices. The stupid mirror trick fools no-one. At one point I got elbowed by the bread guy as he tried to serve the adjoining table. Losing a table or two would be a major revenue blow for them so they just have to move - immediately.

After a bit of discussion we decided to try the Tasting Menu with wines. The sommelier asked if we had any preferences on the wine but we just put ourselves entirely in his hands. I have to say that all his selections were fantastic. Every wine felt perfect for the dish that it accompanied. Even the dessert wine, which I hate, worked well. A big thank you to him for giving us a menu to take home with all the wines written down beside the  courses.

After a beautiful mouth-explosion taster trio involving foams, jellies and mini-soups we moved to the tasting menu. It was as follows (with apologies for the spellings on the wines):

*   Roasted Scallops with caramelised chicoree, blood orange and black grapes - This was stunning. I loved every part of the dish. One of the highlights of the night. Wine was Motto Piane Sauvignon Blanc 2007 from Italy. I didn't even know they did Sauvignon in Italy. I'll be looking out for some from now on.

*   Fois Gras and prune terrine with pear puree, air dried duck and pickled pear slices - Another fabulous dish. Catherine's favourite. Wine was Cuvee Marie from Charles Hours 2003 from South West France. Another seriously great wine.
At this point I thought we were looking at the second best meal we've ever had.

*   Sea Bass with hot fennel mayo, chilled fennel soup, black olive, and sardines on sour dough - This was good but not at the mouth-explosion level of everything that preceded it. Just a decent fish dish. It was then that we realised that too many of the dishes were aniseedy via fennel or celeriac. You'd be in serious trouble with the menu if you weren't a fan. Wine was Arneis from Seghesio, 2004 from the Russian River Valley in the US. This was one of our favourites of the night. A real winner.

*   Loin of Lamb with chickpeas, aubergine puree, tomato petals and buckler sorrel - This was a completely bizarre dish which didn't work for either of us. A plate was placed in front of us covered in dabs of various purees and chickpeas. In a side-dish (!) was the lamb and jus. The purees really were not very nice at all and the lamb was overwhelmed by rosemary which was a terrible pity since it was succulent. However my first taste of sweetbreads was a real revelation and they were gorgeous. Wine was a Saint-Emilion Grand Cru, Chateau Sansonnet 2001 which was sadly badly masked by the food.

*   Selection of cheese and crackers - All of them good and I liked the fact that we both got a different selection with a different jam/chutney in the middle. Wine was Madiran Chateau Montus 2003 from South West France. Another perfect matching with the food.

*   Raspberries with almond milk, raspberry jelly and almond biscuit - Nice dessert but pretty forgettable and the block of frozen parfait(?) was just icy . Wine was Montbazillac Chateau Tireuil la Graviere 2001 from South West France. As I said earlier, I hate sweet wine but this really did suit the dessert well.

*   Passion fruit with coconut cream, mango puree, marmalade with warm caramel and passion fruit jelly - Another very tasty but not memorable or special dessert. The wine was Riesling Vom Bunten Shiefer from Hans Lang in Germany, 2003\. I loved this one too and will be seeking out some good Riesling from now on.
As I said, overall the food was to a very high standard and the wines were excellent. But both was diminished badly by the completely cack-handed front of house. There were multiple problems:

*   I have no idea who the Maitre d' was. Was it the small blonde wine guy who disappeared once we got our order in? Or the tall woman who came over to our table towards the end when Catherine was in the loo, folded her napkin and walked away without a word? Or some invisible third party?

*   In Petrus we knew exactly who was in charge and he came over several times, not to ask some bland ""did you enjoy your meal?"" but to engage and converse. Thinking about Mint after the meal, the strong sense I got was a lack of confidence from everyone front-of-house and so a complete lack of proper engagement with their customers.

*   Our wine glasses spent a _lot_ of time empty. I've listed a large number of wines above but at one point the only thing left on the table was two napkins and two glasses of water. Again at this price level, I expect to be permanently topped up, not penny pinched.

*   When I say I don't want bread twice in a row, stop bloody coming back! What was it, 5 times? 6 times?

*   Don't tell me we have to be out by 9pm when you know you don't have a full set of bookings for 9pm, when you don't serve our last course until 9.15 and when you leave us 10-15 minutes between a few of the courses without even wine in our glasses. And all of this in a non-full restaurant.

*   Absolutely no acknowledgment was made of the fact that it was my 40th birthday despite them being told so. In Jacob's on the Mall last year, I got a special dessert and the Maitre d' had a wee chat. In Petrus for our anniversary, we got a tour of the kitchen and met the amazing Marcus Wearing. On other occasions I've got a complementary cocktail. Here? Nothing! Not even Happy Bloody Birthday.

*   When we left, there was no-one racing to open the door, ask us how the meal was or wish us on our way. We just snuck away in the night.

*   They couldn't even handle the fact that the meal was supposed to be paid-for as a gift. We were getting into the cab when one of the waiters (or maybe the Maitre d', who knows?) ran out and grabbed us, apologised profusely since they had just realised who we were and said that they'd cancel our credit card charge. We told him not to bother as we'd sort it out ourselves. He was insistent but we were doubly so. There was clearly no-one running the booking system all night; no-one in proper charge; no-one who had scanned everything before service to see if there was anything unusual to warn the staff about. Amateur hour to be honest.
I'm not going to say the price of the meal, you can work it out yourself. But when you are paying that kind of money, having coffee and petit fours as an extra at over €6 is just plain scabby. The big shock on the bill was a mandatory 12.5% service charge. Let's be blunt here, the service didn't warrant it. 6% max, maybe. And if it's mandatory then just put it in the price of the meal. Otherwise, why not separately call out the pastry charge, the loo roll charge and the dishwashing charge?

My gut tells me that, sadly, Mint will not survive. Dylan is clearly a talented chef but he's not a restaurateur based on the front of house shambles we encountered. In a restaurant with a mix of two-tops and four-tops, none of the four-tops seemed to be occupied on a Saturday night. The prices are frankly ridiculous for a pokey little place with inexperienced staff. The blatant gouging via extras and service charges tells me they are in trouble.

We realised we could have flown to London, eaten in one of 200 better restaurants there, stayed the night and flown home the following day for less than Mint cost with its dazzling views of Spar. In a weakening economy, places like this which don't deliver value (at whatever the price level) are the first to go to the wall. In a strange twist of timing and history, could we be seeing a re-run of Peacock Alley?

Having said alllllll of the above, we are so glad we gave it a go, so grateful to my parents for arranging and paying for it and so glad to have had a great meal."
Mirch Masala - Best vegan menu in Ireland?,"We are spending two weeks in Clon whilst our kitchen gets rebuilt and decided to treat ourselves to an Indian takeaway on the first night. A bit of googling revealed that there was a new place called [Mirch Masala](https://www.mirchmasalacork.com/), so I loaded up their website on my phone and my jaw hit the floor as I started browsing the menu.

The range of vegan and vegetarian options is almost beyond belief. On our trip to London last summer I could not find any Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi restaurant near Shoreditch with an extensive vegan menu. Dishoom came closest. So to find a local West Cork dine-in and takeaway Indian offering this many dishes is shocking.

I'm also a bit stunned the Irish Veganorati on Instagram have not been talking about this *all the time*. They should be shouting it from the rooftops. Honestly, if you're within an hour (or even more) of Clonakilty and you're vegan or vegetarian, you should make the journey.

The other thing to love about them is that all of the bog-standard Anglo-Irish-Indian-Pakistani-Bangladeshi dishes are there but they are are well down the page. You'd be much better off trying all the other fantastic dishes they offer instead of the same-old same-old.

Pretty much everything has the option to be vegan including the naans and the raita!

I really enjoyed my chickpea curry (Amritsari Chole) and my wife loved her vegan kofta curry. The naans tasted freshly made with tons of garlic and fresh coriander. The sweet potato fries were delish too.

![Amritsari Chole](/images/2022/01/mirch.jpg)

It's such a pleasure to see forward-thinking businesses like this settting up in semi-rural Ireland. I also just learned about [Budds](http://budds.ie/) in Ballydehob and will be making a trip to check out their vegan options too. Compare that to a new local ""NYC-inspired"" burger joint that opened recently and doesn't even offer the classic chipper salad burger, let alone a proper veggie/vegan option. 6 square inches in the freezer and an open mind is all they need to join the 21st century.

Oh and meat-eaters, fear not, Mirch Masala has a full menu for you too. You poor darlings with everything everywhere being vegan in January 😉

"Mmm, spicy","The parents are in Spain and my mother gave me a shout to see if I wanted anything whilst she was there. The last time she got me a fab selection of Chorizo and Salami which I am still working through. So I just asked for the same again. But I also asked her if she would keep her eye out for Smoked Paprika - the main flavour in Chorizo. Fiona failed to find it on her last trip and I'm beginning to think that someone will have to find a  spice emporium  over there. Bit of a coincidence that one of the foodie blogs that I read ([Chocolate and Zucchini](http://chocolateandzucchini.com) - a great read if a little high-falutin) has [a full post on Piment&oacute;n de la Vera](http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2005/09/pimentn_de_la_vera.php) which is exactly what I asked my Ma to look out for. Fingers crossed.

On a vaguely related note, anyone know if you can buy the Weber Bullet BBQ Smoker in Ireland? Some day I am going to try to BBQ a full Brisket (14lbs of it!) just like this: [Brisket Midnight Cook](http://www.virtualweberbullet.com/brisket2.html)

Last year on a business trip to Austin TX, I was brought to [The Salt Lick ](http://www.saltlickbbq.com/)by Tim Dell. I can still remember the taste of the BBQ Brisket, and the smoked turkey, and the sausage. Oh, I think I need to lie down for a second. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

After I came back I tried to BBQ a small  Irish  brisket of 2 lbs or so. I utterly incinerated it but it was bloody tasty!"
Mmm Trebor Fruit Salad,"Just as I start grumping that there is nothing on the telly, a chunk of genius appears in the shape of Oz Clarke and James May with ""Oz and James' Big Wine Adventure"" (Wednesdays 8pm BBC2). I used to watch Oz and Jilly for laughs back in the old Food and Drink days. They were so off the wall I don't think I ever learned anything. James is of course Captain Slow on Top Gear and knows absolutely nothing about wine. The pair of them head off on a tour of France in a Jag XJS so Oz can teach James all about wine.

Sure it's a standard ""Odd Couple"" bickering idea but it works soooo well. James is a big kid and Oz is desperately pompous so the sparks fly constantly. The scene of the two of them in disposable thongs getting into a bath of grape extract together at a Wine Spa is indelibly burned on my brain.

I'm of the James persuasion. He wants to learn enough to be able to buy good bottles of £5.99 French wine in his supermarket. Poor Oz wants to ""educate"" him. The word terroir hasn't come up yet but it's bound to at which point James will blow his whistle called the Ozillator to stop Oz being a wine bore.

James makes some wine by crushing grapes with a dirty hoe, adding sugar and yeast and leaving it in the boot of the car for a week. He then does a taste test of three wines including his own at a French Market. One poor muppet picks James' as the best!

At Château Pichon-Longueville-Comtesse-de-Lalande I was reminded why Aussie wine with ""Shiraz"" on the bottle sells better. C'mon, that name's up there with Tarquin Lim Tim Bim Fim Bim Ole Ftang Ftang Biscuit Barrel. They went into the cellars with Grand Dame Madame May-Elaine de Lencquesaing and discussed ancient wine. James was chomping at the bit ""but they are just looking at it, what's the point of that?"". Madame showed wines from 1817 and 1940\. No mention of how they managed to make wine in 1940, cough, don't mention the war, cough.

But the absolute highlight of the programme was the taste test they did at Château Pichon-Baron, in front of one of the wine industry’s biggest players, Englishman Christian Seely. They gave James three wines to get his opinion of their bouquet. The first was a young white bordeaux which should have peaches, apricots etc. James sniffed, thought, sniffed again and came up with ""Dope"". If the ground could have swallowed Oz whole. Next up a £120 Grand Cru which should have smelled of blackcurrants. James interpretation of this -  ""Trebor Fruit Salad"". Ozes face was frozen in horror. And finally, another Red which should smell of tobacco. James does much better on this ""Bonfire, BBQ sausage, Pork"". Oz looks ready to kill him, Then magically ""and a hint of Virginia tobacco"". Hurrah, reputation recovered.

Very very funny TV but Oz is failing in one area that James himself mentions several times and that is in the actual education about wine. Oz is so obsessed with the culture and history he forgets simple things - like what grape is white bordeaux made from? I had to Google it as my knowledge of French wines stretches from Sancerre to Pouilly Fumé which is a distance of approximately 400 yards on the Loire I think. Ah, it's also Sauvignon Blanc with some Semillion and other optionals. Might give that a go.

If you want a giggle and to learn a bit about wine in the process, you cannot miss this programme.

Mock-Tudor Edwardian Georgian Castle with Irish Bar,"Ah yes, those Sheraton folks in Massachusetts really know their architecture. Our hotel was only bettered by the one we drove under which straddled the Massachusetts Turnpike. I've always wanted a room with cars whizzing past 20 feet under my floor.

Shopping disaster - only had time for Toys R Us. Kids happy even if I'm still without a new keyboard and mouse. 

On the other hand, we had some very successful meals. If you are ever in Framingham, check out ""Legal Seafood"" - great food, good buzz and grumpy waitresses; ""are you finished with that or do you want to pick some more?"" (that's an exact quote). Arturo's Italian was more downmarket but incredibly friendly and not bad food - better than 99.99% of Italian joints in Ireland. Having said that, my risotto is better. And finally ""The Naked Fish"" - another top class fish restaurant, really tasty food and impressive considering it seems to be a chain. How the hell did I not get a burger in the entire week?

Our ""Summit"" was a major success. It's nice to know that the work you do, beavering away in Cork, is actually appreciated coast to coast in the US. Came away with tons to do which is always a good sign. And a week after I first heard the phrase, someone else said: ""we suck less"". Amen brother.

More FSAI Nonsense - Now They are Trying to Ban Raw Milk,"After the pork recall debacle, you'd thing the FSAI would get a bit of cop-on but obviously they need to keep inventing make-work to keep themselves in jobs. Their latest wheeze is to try and ban Raw Milk. Not bleach-cleaned chicken nuggets or mechanically recovered meat burgers or sausages with 53% ""meat"". No, they want to ban a product that some people actively seek out and choose to drink.

I'm really really getting sick and tired of this bullshit. It's a miracle that you can still buy unpasteurised cheese in this country with these drones in charge. If I want to drink raw milk I damn well will and I won't have some paper-shuffler using ""safety"" as a code-word for control, telling me otherwise.

The last time I had raw milk I was about 6 years old. It was straight from the cow in my Grand-aunt's house. I didn't really like it. But I'm bloody going out this week to see if I can buy some more.

[Slow Food Ireland has a petition](http://www.slowfoodireland.com/index.php/food/raw-milk-petition.html) to try and stop these muppets having their way. I strongly recommend that you sign it before all of your rights to buy and eat what you like are taken away from you.

We really seem to be heading towards a world of zero responsibility and zero consequences with faceless bureaucrats deciding everything. The ongoing collapse of the European project shows exactly where that leads."
More in the long list of Oisín gems,"Yes I know it's just another ""kids say the funniest things"" post but this wee 5-year old thinks deeper than most.

Never promise a bed-time story and then renege:
""Dad when I grow up, I'm going to get married like you, and have babies like you, and forget things like you""

Recent obsession with death:
""Dad, when we all die, does that mean someone else might live in our house?"". ""Yes they will Ois"". ""So like, they'll get all our DVDs?""

At least I've taught him to say ""I'm going to be an engineer when I grow up, like my mum and dad"". Of course he thinks that means he'll be fixing airplanes and computers. I'm having a hard time explaining the word design."
More on Cork Car Sharing,"Mike Newham has updated us on Car Sharing in Cork:
> We're pushing out the introduction in Cork till July the 4th because of the massive VRT changes that occur on that date.  We'll start off with eight cars on the road - 3 Ford Focuses (Foci?), 4 Ford Fiestas and 1 Transit Connect for delivery's and the like.
> 
> All will be low emission diesels with extra safety options and lots of helpful gizmos like bluetooth and sat-nav. They'll all be positioned in and around Cork City Centre.
> 
> We've made a decision to postpone the new website till about mid-May when it will be fully operational to allow new members to join and book cars.
> 
> By the way CarSharing for us is not ride-sharing or car-pooling, its basically the service by which you book a car for a number of hours, use it for those hours and get charged for those hours.

More Science Week Stuff,"Looks like the [Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.ie/) guys are hardcore! They've hired Edelman to help with PR. I like the idea they came up with. Basically Irish Bloggers have to answer some stuff about their favourite inventions as blog posts during the coming week and we might win a Wii. 

Today's question is **""What was the favourite invention from your childhood""**. 

This is an easy one. The home computer, specifically the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. 

[![ZXSpectrum48k](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2143/1998689537_8b290280f6_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/1998689537/ ""ZXSpectrum48k by bandon1, on Flickr"")

An entire generation of software developers and electronic engineers exist because of this awesome machine and competitors like the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Dragon 32, Oric 1, Atari 400/800, TI 99/a etc

Until the arrival of the Spectrum (and slightly earlier ones like the ZX81, ZX80, TRS-80), the most advanced thing most people had seen was electronic tennis on the telly. I still remember heading up on a school tour to Dublin, going into Tomorrow's World in the Grafton Arcade and touching a ZX81 for the first time. My parents then bought me a 16K Spectrum for Christmas 1982 and my world changed forever.

Forget all the games we used play and copy using a precursor of bittorrent called tape-to-tape-recording. For me, the Spectrum experience was about programming and building add-on cards. I learned Basic, then Forth and then Z80 Assembler.

I had my 15 seconds of fame by having three games published in Sinclair magazines. I was half way through my masterpiece when college intervened. I did Electronics in UCD because of the Spectrum (I didn't like the look of Cobol and RPG on the Comp Sci syllabus) and here I am now, still working in tech and still getting excited every day by the incredible things people build. 

I enjoy seeing kids using gaming consoles and playing flash games on the web but I wonder will they ever have the excitement we did back in the 80's when we saw the output of this:

10 FOR n=0 TO 255
20 PLOT n,88+80*SIN(n/128*PI)
30 NEXT n

Who knows, maybe the [OLPC aka XO](http://www.laptopgiving.org/en/index.php) will do the same for Africa. I still have my doubts."

Movie about Rwanda,"About a month ago a guy named Eoin Feeley posted a comment on my [July post about 07/07](http://conoroneill.com/2005/07/11/you-gotta-love-londoners/). He asked me to highlight two blogs concerned with a new movie about the genocide in Rwanda called  ""Shooting Dogs"" starring John Hurt.

I was a bit suprised that he referred to my blog as political because apart from the odd dig at Islamo-fascists and their apologists, I mainly talk about food!

Start Rant:

But I have always been deeply angry about what happened in Rwanda and how the world just stood back and let it happen, just like they are doing all over again in Darfur. Rwanda was the nadir of the Clinton adminstration and should surely have precluded Kofi Annan from ever becoming Secretary General of the UN. The same people who call George Bush and Ariel Sharon mass murderers seem to have no problem idolising those two cowards with their hands soaked in the blood of Africans.

End Rant.

In any case, apologies to Eoin for not posting this sooner. If you want to find out more about the movie (given that I know nothing about it!) head on over to the [Official Blog](http://www.shootingdogsfilm.blogspot.com/) and  [The Rwandan Survivors Blog](http://www.rwandansurvivors.blogspot.com/).

Sophie Grigson laments the lack of interest in spider crab meat in the British Isles and recommends it highly. However she describes the preparation of it as ""approaching tedious"". To quote Bill: ""Baby, you ain't kiddin"". Over an hour with pliers and a hammer (yes, from my tool box, yes, washed of all WD-40) to extract a tiny mound of meat.

I did a lovely crab salad and a pseudo dressed crab thingy. Both of them were lip-smackingly good and the meat was really tasty. But I am never, ever prepping one again.

Murphy's Awesome Ice-Cream now blogging,"Kieran from Murphy's Ice Cream in Dingle [posted a comment](http://conoroneill.com/2005/12/12/irish-food-producers-and-the-cluetrain-manifesto/#comments) to this blog last week and let me know that they [now have a blog of their own](http://icecreamireland.blogspot.com/). I'll probably have to give Catherine a sedative when I tell her that they have a chocolate sauce recipe on it already.

Murphy's Coffee/Ice-Cream shop was the highlight of our walkabout in Killarney last Autumn. Fab coffee and stunning ice-cream. I just went with a simple double scoop of something fruity and Catherine went for one of their more complex creations. She nearly did a Meg Ryan on it as she worked her way through it. I think it may almost be a case of Comic Book Man from the Simpsons ""Best Ice Cream....Ever"". Thinking way back, I've a feeling we had some scoops in their Dingle shop maybe 10 years ago? Were they open then? The fact that it still sticks in my mind tells you something about their ice-cream.

I'm thrilled that they are blogging because I am not just married to an ice-cream fanatic but I also recently bought her an ice-cream maker and I think she'll have the motor burnt out in a month. I just got the cheapy (£25) Kenwood IM-250 from Amazon (I'm sure you can get it in many department stores in Ireland). I didn't want to spend too much in case it turned out to be too much hassle to use one. But it turns out to be very straightforward. So far we have had a few fruity frozen yoghurts and a proper custard based chocolate one. I think Catherine may have found her niche. Christmas may involve the purchase of one of the huge self-cooling machines.

Interestingly, I think that owning an ice-cream maker will cause us to buy more ice-cream rather than less as we try out flavours and compare textures. I highly recommend that you read Kieran's blog, post lots of comments, tell him all your ice-cream fantasies and most important of all - seek out their ice-cream!

I'm really looking forward to reading more of his thoughts and to buying more of their fantastic produce in Urru in Bandon.

UPDATE 1: I've obviously lost a lot of brain cells over the years, Murphy's only opened in 2000 so I must have been somewhere else in Dingle back in the 90's.

My Army training tells me... that this is going to be a hot mission,"Usually I'm on the ball when it comes to great new TV shows. I'm also incredibly modest and humble. I've been raving about ""Curb"" since I watched it on DVD before it was shown here. But I completely let ""[Arrested Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development_%28TV_series%29)"" slip past me. I used hear about the awards and how funny it was but never got round to checking it out. 

About two months ago I finally set it to record on the Sky+. Woo hoo - another classic. I love it. Offbeat, oddball, mainstream but not quite, fabulous writing and even better acting. Sure, all the characters are stereotypes and they try to make every line a puchline but it's that rat-a-tat-tat of jokes that make it great. They come so fast but also so obtusely that you miss about half of them.

There is a great series of episodes where one of the characters [tries to be one of the Blue Men](http://the-op.com/media/image2.php?oid=254&i=708&cat=6200) from [The Blue Man Group](http://www.blueman.com/about_bmg/index.shtml).

I can imagine this is causing the real group all sorts of problems. I saw an ad for them in the paper recently and laughed, assuming it was for the TV show. Nope, real ad. Unless I can bring rocks to throw, I don't think I'll be going any time soon.

UnfortunatelyArrested Development has a big problem. It is pitched as a mainstream show in the US but simply doesn't get the viewing figures to support that. They were about to cancel it after the first series and then they won a bunch of Emmy's so had to keep showing it. It looks like it is [up for the chop again](http://www.lostremote.com/archives/006527.html).

[Lost Remote](http://www.lostremote.com/archives/006533.html) has a brilliant posting on how this might actually be a good thing for the show and how to make it even more popular by viral means.

More on  [The Long Tail](http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2005/11/a_long_tail_str.html) 

Unless Rupert suddenly starts ""getting"" the way media is heading (and to be fair he hasn't missed much over the past few years) and takes Lost Remote's advice to use all that Web2.0 has to offer in terms of marketing (work that meme baby), you'd better catch it while you can.

My first ever IMRA/MMRA trail run in Castlefreke - impressive turnout and tons of kids!,"I only learned of the [Irish Mountain Running Assocation](https://www.imra.ie/) (and Munster Mountain Running Association branch) last year. They have [an extensive line-up of events](https://www.imra.ie/events/) all year from hard-core 127km Ultras to family friendly events like [today's run](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1477) in Castlefreke Woods and Long Strand.

![Castlefreke Forest](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-02-05%2010.52.35b.jpg)

And unlike a lot of running related things in recent years, it's an absolute bargain to take part. €10 annual membership and €5 for today's race.

I had no idea what to expect today. Would it be 10 people or 100? Beginners or Jim Walmsleys? It was a good mixed group of people. The turnout for the junior race was really impressive. I regretted not bringing some of my brood, I think they would have enjoyed it.

![Junior Race](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-02-05%2010.36.07b.jpg)

I identified the very serious mountain people by their shoes. Anyone in Salomon or Inov-8 was clearly not messing around. I had my US-trail-style Altra Lone Peaks which were perfect for today's conditions but had very poor downhill grip before Christmas when I tried to do part of St Finbarr's Way from the Gougane Barra side and landed on my arse several times coming back down in boggy muddy wet conditions.

The course today had to be changed due to flooding on the path out to Kilkern Lake. It was manky when I did it before Christmas too. This meant that they added an extra nasty road hill but it gave me a chance to go on the newish trail parallel to Long Strand which is lovely, albeit too short. 

The view as you come to the top of the hill on the road out of Rathbarry is utter perfection. If I hadn't been so intent on not coming last, I'd have stopped for 5 minutes just to soak it in.

The run was brilliant. The bit along Long Strand was pure torture, just like the last time I did a run here, so I had to walk most of it. There is no hard packed sand on that beach so you sink in with every footstep. At least now I know I'm never doing [Marathon Des Sables](http://marathondessables.co.uk/) :-) 

![Long Strand](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/16422850_1267538586672655_2746855433585271530_o.jpg)

The climb up to the big cross got the heart pumping and the hell-for-leather run down the other side to the end was a blast.

I can't recommend runs like this highly enough. They are cheap, mostly short, friendly, fun and have everyone from mountain goats to blobs like me.

My first mention in a national newspaper does not include the phrase  the accused ,"When Haydn [asked the question recently](http://argolon.com/BarCampIreland/blog/2006/10/05/contact-numbers-for-all-the-speakers/#comment-94) on the BarCamp Ireland blog if anybody had&nbsp;any favourite Irish entertainment sites/blogs and I replied,&nbsp;little did I know that he was going to quote me more than once in The Irish Times. I thought it would be just&nbsp;part of a&nbsp;""Conor likes this"", ""Mick likes that"" ""Mary&nbsp;like these"" list. Chuffed? Hell I grinned from Bandon to Dublin yesterday.

That has to be one of the&nbsp;best newspaper articles I have read in a long time. Not only was it almost entirely non-Dublin-centric, it talked about exciting things which are still outside the mainstream&nbsp;and&nbsp;reminded me&nbsp;how dull most mainstream media has become. My gut (big as it is) tells me that there is a major opportunity just bubbling under the surface here and I can't wait to see who grabs it and runs with it.&nbsp;

[Swearing Lady](http://arseendofireland.blogspot.com/) deserves a huge readership and I'm thrilled he gave her so much coverage. Haydn called her ""arguably the most talented writer at work today in Ireland"" and I completely agree. I may be an RSS&nbsp;addict with my 350 feeds but of all of them,&nbsp;her writing is&nbsp;something&nbsp;I actively look forward to every day.&nbsp;I'm sure HarperCollins will be banging down her door soon to add her to their pedigree stable as an understudy to Cecelia ;-)

Haydn himself has a few superb blogs with [Mediangler](http://www.mediangler.com/) (no not Media Langer) being the main one &nbsp;and I particularly love his new site that he runs with his wife called [My Diet Friends](http://www.mydietfriends.com/). This is a site about diet rather than dieting and &nbsp;if you have any interest in healthy eating and food, it is a must read.

Recently both CNET and Yahoo have launched food sites and I find myself bristling just thinking about them. In both cases I just feel like tech/media companies have spotted another valuable demographic with monetizable eyeballs rather than really giving a damn about food. They are not, [as Seth Godin would say](http://www.allmarketersareliars.com/), telling authentic stories. Have a look over at what PodChef Neal [is doing on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Podchef) to see how passion and knowledge count for far more than slick design.

I'll stick with [Podchef](http://podchef.motime.com/),&nbsp;[My Diet Friends](http://www.mydietfriends.com), [eGullet](http://www.egullet.org/), [Elise Bauer](http://www.elise.com/), [Bibliocook](http://www.bibliocook.com/) and the handful of other sites/blogs run by people who are genuinely passionate about food.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <div class=""description"">

I heard about this deli over three years ago and have been meaning to go since. The story was that they had great Italian food but at non-ripoff prices since they are also a wholesalers.

Brendan mentioned it recently as a comment on this blog and we agreed to meet up last Saturday morning. He arrived with his Sardinian wife Laetitia and their two daughters. I arrived with numbers 2, 3 and 4.

However, we got there first and I decided it had shut down since there was no sign of a deli. The others arrived shortly after and drove over to this utterly non-descript industrial unit and there it was ""The Boot's Specialities"". I had seen the sign but assumed they were shoe distributors.

Unfortunately they also looked shut. Brendan rang Pasquale the onwer and it turned out he was inside prepping. He let us in with a big welcome a few minutes later.

Inside was a bunch of shelves with all sorts of pasta, sweets, drinks, sauces, wines, flour and ingredients. He had laid out some lovely cheese, olives, salami and mortadella to taste. My monsters started acting up so he broke out some bikkies too.

Laetitia and Brendan showed me all of the things they liked and I grabbed bits of everything. Some parma, salted capers, soup pasta, the Italian version of Monster Munch, olives, olive oil, coffee, those breakfast biscuits, the works.

I think we were the only people speaking English there and he was very busy. Not too busy tho to shock me by handing me an espresso he made himself using one of those stove top little pots. I think I love this man.

The reason I absolutely adored this deli was because it was the real stuff that real Italians eat. He didn't have 16 different single estate extra virgin olive oils, he had one. He also didn't have vintage red wine vinegar, just good normal stuff. Even more impressive was that many of the prices  were far lower than you'd pay in Tesco!

I had a conversation with Haydn recently about the modern midle-class food fetishization that goes on. It seems sometimes like all those frou-frou shops are there to massage our gourmand egos rather than provide great food at good prices. I see Pasquale as the antidote to that.

He didn't even mind when Oisín told him he talked funny :-) And those Monster Munch (Cipster) went down a storm with the kids.

I'll be back very very soon without the fighting children to check out the fridge section. I'll still need my advisors tho.

<abbr title=""5"" class=""rating"">&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;</abbr> Well over a year ago, I blogged about [the lack of burger innovation](http://conoroneill.com/2005/06/25/burger-innovation-in-ireland/) in Ireland. I recently did a pit stop at the new Midway Food Court on the M7/M8 split outside Portlaoise but was disappointed to only find O'Brien's open. I went back again on Monday to grab a quick sambo and noticed that one new place was open - ""[Real Gourmet Burger](http://www.realgourmetburger.ie/)"". I ran as fast as a fat man can to the counter and was handed a menu. Tears of joy welled up in my eyes as I read ""original chargrilled burger with red onion and tomato relish"", ""lamb burger with mozzarella and pesto"" ""spicy chorzio sausage..... I had to sit down to compose myself.

It's a lovely setup with disposable wooden cutlery and recycled cardboard trays and beautiful seats. I ended up plumping for a guacamole burger ""zesty guacamole, aged Irish cheddar, crispy pancetta and tomato relish"", chunky chips and a latte which came to a bit over €14\. That is pricey but it was more of a dinner than a lunch and all the ingredients are top quality. The burger was fabulous  in a bun by the Bretzel Bakery but I'd have preferred it a smidge less well done (they quote it as medium). Chips were fab and the coffee made O'Brien's look like a bad paddy joke. It does take 15 mins to get the burger but it is well worth the wait. I was the only diner at 12 midday just after opening but a few more had arrived by 12.30\. 

This is fast food done right and I hope hope hope that enough people become regulars to allow them to grow into an empire that stretches to at least Cork. If you live in the midlands or are going anywhere on the N7/N8, this is a must-try.

Their web-site is just a holding page right now. If anyone is interested, I'll scan the menu and post it here. I'm sure they won't mind a bit of copyright infringement if it drives some business their way.

My Proposed Questions to the HSE under Freedom of Information,"The scandal that is the non-vaccination using BCG of children in Cork could have far-reaching implications for the health of many people under the age of 30\. Both employees of the then Southern Health Board and the political appointees to the board may have had a say in implementing this negligent policy and continuing to allow it to occur since the 1970's. It is clear that the health of Cork children is considered less important than that of children from elsewhere in the country. 

I've just been informed that budget was put aside to deal with this in 2004 and was then re-allocated. In the interests of accuracy I have decided to contact the HSE under the Freedom of information act to find out who, why and when decisions were made in this area since the 1970's.

Below are my questions. Please add to them or improve on them in the comments section and I'll put together a combined list and send it to the HSE. It'll be interesting to see if there is any attempt made to delay the answers until after May 17th.

1.  On what dates was the decision made and then implemented to stop providing BCG routinely to newborn babies in the Cork region years ago?
2.  Provide the names of all the senior individuals (medical, administrative, consultant, board members) involved in the making of that decision
3.  Provide the names of all past or present TDs, Senators or Councillors who were on the Southern Health Board when that decision was made
4.  Did the board authorise that decision? If so, provide the names of all members of that board
5.  Provide the names of all past or present TDs, Senators or Councillors who were on the Southern Health Board since the decision
6.  Confirm whether the provision of BCG as a matter of routine was agreed to be re-introduced at any point since then, on what dates and by whom
7.  Confirm whether that NEW decision was overturned, for what reason, by whom and when
8.  Confirm that BCG shots are available in some locations nationally on demand and list the places where there is no waiting list
9.  Confirm that residents of Cork can avail of these BCG shots and provide contact information for arranging these shots"
Neven watchable but not memorable,"I've always been a huge fan of Neven. Anyone who can run a successful restaurant in the middle of nowhere in rural Cavan gets my vote. His energy is always fantastic too. This new show is ok but nothing amazing.

I'm surprised to see cookery programmes still being made that refer to ""dinner parties"". Does anyone still have those? 

His three dishes in the opening episode were asparagus and smoked salmon tartlet, confit duck and a tiramsu variant.

Whilst I loved the look of the first dish, it seems a bit ridiculous to have an asparagus recipe in January. Or a salad with Nasturtium flowers whilst we're on the subject. Have the producers of the programme missed every single Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall espisode ever made? Where did the idea of seasonal produce go?

The trip to the organic egg farm was enlightening and provided another one of those interesting tid-bits. The farmer supplies most of his eggs to Lidl and Aldi. Weird then that most of the organic eggs in those shops in Cork seem to have either UK or German markings on them.

The confit duck looked gorgeous but I'd love to know how much the average punter would have to pay for a few litres of duck fat. I think I'll stick with the canned one like most French people do.

The show has great potential given the presenter involved but it doesn't feel fully formed or thought out. The show that RTE needs to make, that would become legendary, is to have Darina do one based on her new book. Show people how to cook lovely food frugally. ""Feed your family for a tenner a day"" or something. Review of that book coming soon. Summary: One of the top ten cook books of all time.

New Alerting System from Cork County Council,"It's great to see Cork CoCo finally putting an [Alerts system](http://mapalerts.corkcoco.ie/) in place. It's very easy to use. You simply go to the relevant [Map Alerts](http://mapalerts.corkcoco.ie/) site and register there with your mobile/email/etc. You can also add your home and work locations for alerts.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/logo.jpg ""logo"")](http://mapalerts.corkcoco.ie/)

Right now they are doing Alerts for Met Eireann Severe Weather Warnings in all of the County and for Flood Warnings in Clonakilty. I assume they'll eventually integrate [Bandon FEWS](http://bandonfloodwarning.ie/) in too rather than running two separate systems.

Other Alerts they will add in the future (presumably on the same opt-in basis) are:

*   Road Closure and Scheduled Road Works
*   Road Gritting and Salting Updates
*   Road Incidents and Accidents
*   Water Service Disruptions and Boil Water Notices
*   Community and Miscellaneous Events
*   Major Emergencies
<div>You can see all the [latest alerts](http://mapalerts.corkcoco.ie/cork-alerts) here.</div>
The system is powered by [Map Alerter](http://www.mapalerter.com/), an Irish company based in Carlow and run by Brendan Cunningham. They already have several other CoCos using the system and I look forward to all counties signing up.

MapAlerter [has an API](http://api.mapalerter.com/) and RSS feeds available and I'll do a post here soon on how to use them for the Cork data. It's a brilliant example of real #opendata being made available rather than being talked about.

I have to assume some of the towns in the county are creating, or have created, iPhone/Android Apps for their town. Alerts would be a very useful addition to those.

Well done to all involved."

Check it out - great pictures (not just car pr0n) and huge enthusiasm. He has a winner on his hands.

New Cork Foodie Blogger,"Ivan Santry has started a top-notch food blog over at [Messy-Chef](http://messy-chef.com/blog/). Recipes, reviews and thoughts. The blog design looks gorgeous too. 

[![Messy Chef](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3277/2709346493_4f774ba9ee.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2709346493/ ""Messy Chef by bandon1, on Flickr"")

Check it out."
New Dianne Curtin Web-site,"Delighted to see that food writer Dianne Curtin has launched [a new web-site](http://diannecurtin.com/drupal/). If you are into food, you should check it out. She has news, tips, recipes and podcasts already. Since the site is built on Drupal, I think we can expect lots more  features to appear over time."
New Honda Civic ad on Channel 4,"One of the best TV ads I have ever seen for a motor car. Must be a couple of minutes long and surely costs a fortune to broadcast. But worth it for them if they are ever to change the UK demographic from 55-85 to 25-35\. They rightly have much younger buyers in Ireland. Just checked and they have [some of the sound effects from the ad on their UK site](http://www.honda.co.uk/civic/) too.

I had a look at the car in [Kevin O'Leary's](http://www.kolgroup.ie/) the other day (whilst on my bike, strangely). Fabulous looking and much bigger than it appears in pictures. Not that I'll ever get one (some day I want to test drive a Type-R), our next car is a [VW Caravelle](http://www.vwcommercials.ie/configurator/index.cfm?fuseaction=variant&modelID=280&bodyID=4222).

[Finbarr Galvin](http://www.finbarrgalvin.ie/) up the road is selling a 1979 Roller. No price tag. Now that's what you need for sitting in traffic jams. Could you imagine arriving into work driving one? Would I have to wear a suit and smoke a pipe before they'll give me a drive in it? Or would the Civic be more comfortable?

New Irish Food and Drink Magazine - EatMagazine,"[EatMagazine](http://issuu.com/phonic_magazine/docs/eatmagazine1) launches today. There will be 20,000 free print copies per month in Dublin initially. It is also available [free online](http://issuu.com/phonic_magazine/docs/eatmagazine1).

I'm pretty stunned that the first issue was all put together by one guy, Mikey Maguire. It's a really impressive piece of work and makes a mockery of much of the so-called professional rubbish you see on newsagents shelves.

Well worth a read.

Nice Car Mate,"That Vauxhall Astra ad is an absolute stonker. I love it. Catches the concept of a petrol-head perfectly.

Ois&iacute;n, my 3 year old, is already well on the road to being a car nut. But somethimes it's just spooky. We were stuck in a traffic jam in Killeagh on Sunday and were stopped beside a new Bangle-era BMW 5-Series. Ois&iacute;n looks out his window and says ""that's the same as grandad's car"". How the hell could he suss that with only the side profile in view when his grandad drives an old-model 7-Series? Then he goes ""the wheels are the same"". Holy crap, I love cars but I never notice the bleedin wheels. Oh I think we may have a future Schumacher on our hands (preferable to a future Irvine anyway).

This is the same child who shamed me at my latest niece's christening on Saturday. We are sitting not-quietly in the church waiting for the gig to start and someone hands Ois&iacute;n a missal. He ""reads"" it for a moment, looks at me and says ""I'll have burgers, chips and ketchup please"". Yes, we are a very religious family........."
No excuses now - Make BCG mandatory in Cork,"For some completely bizarre reason, each regional health board can decide whether to give babies a [BCG](http://www.immunisation.ie/en/ChildhoodImmunisation/BCG/) shot or not as standard. Cork (all of Munster?) is the only region not to. 

Catherine has just pointed me to a story in [The Irish Examiner](http://www.irishexaminer.ie/irishexaminer/pages/story.aspx-qqqg=ireland-qqqm=ireland-qqqa=ireland-qqqid=28504-qqqx=1.asp) about a woman with TB who worked in two creches in Cork. They are now going to have to test every child in both of those locations for infection. 

Other than saving a few quid in the short term, is there any medical reason not to provide it? How would you feel if your kid got TB because some paper pusher in the health service decided Cork people don't need protecting? Maybe they'd like us all to return to the days of Seán Ó Riordáin living in a shed in the garden writing poetry? ""Mar is poll im cheann gach smaoineamh......and the TB ain't so hot either mum""."
Nokia N70 Niggles,"I've had the N70 since April and I'm still in two minds about it. My biggest beef is less with Nokia and more with Vodafone. 

When I got the phone, I checked the firmware and it was at v2.x whilst a check on the web said that the latest was v5.x. I went into Choice Communications in Cork city and asked for an upgrade. It came back with exactly the same version. I badgered the Choice guy but his argument was that the ""system"" decides the correct upgrade and that's what it picked. This is despite the fact that the worksheet had v5.x listed as the newest one. In fact what I figured out later was that v2.x appears to be the latest Vodafone specific firmware. 

This is ridiculous. The current firmware is riddled with bugs and the whole phone is very sluggish. Try pausing an MP3, switching over to the phonebook and receive an SMS - instead of beeping, the bloody thing restarts the MP3 on speakerphone. Great fun in an office!

Does anyone in Ireland have an N70 with v5.x firmware and if so, how did you get it? Is there anyone who will flash one with generic firmware for a few bob? Is there any indication that Voda will ever release a branded v5.x firmware?

Apart from that, I like the size and shape of the phone, the speakerphone is excellent, bluetooth headsets work well (but don't auto-connect for some reason) and I kinda like the Lifeblog idea as a visual history of my phone usage. I don't publish that stuff to a real blog (it only supports Typepad anyway) but it is nice to have on the PC. Third party apps that I like include [Shozu ](http://www.shozu.com/portal/)for auto-upload to Flickr (rarely used due to the idiotic Voda data charges), [Airset ](http://www.airset.com)(calendar sync), [Opera ](http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/)(web browser), [OggPlay ](http://symbianoggplay.sourceforge.net/)(music player), [Frozen bubble](http://fb-s60.sourceforge.net/) (game), [M-SuDoKu](http://phonphun.altervista.org/eng/sudoku.php) (go on, guess), [Python ](http://www.forum.nokia.com/python)(what geek could resist?), [FExplorer ](http://www.gosymbian.com/fexplorer_new.php)(file utility). Third party apps I don't like include [PicoBlogger ](http://www.picostation.com/)(doesn't bloody work at all).

Other gripes with the phone itself are the music player (utter rubbish), number of key presses to send an SMS and the low quality of the camera (for which I had high hopes).

Speaking of music players, can someone please create one targetted at podcast listening? What I need is something that allows me to fast forward quickly and allows me to bookmark within a track. I am sick to death of stopping a podcast 40 minutes in, returning to it later and then spending 5 minutes with my finger on fast forward trying to get back to that point. Maybe even the ability to manually enter a position in a track would be an improvement. I thought Oggplay would solve a lot of my issues but it gets completely confused with my tracklists at the moment so I rarely use it.

Luckily, so far I haven't had the [hot-leg effect](http://irish.typepad.com/irisheyes/2006/06/hot_pocket_in_c.html) that Bernie gets with his.

And finally, to repeat an oft-stated annoyance - would O2 and Voda please get a clue and provide flat-rate data plans like they do in many other countries? Can their number crunchers not do simple sums? 10000 users X crazy price per KB is a much smaller revenue number than 500000 users X €10 fixed extra charge per month.

Non-technical unconferences,"You may have noted my lack of posting on my various blogs recently. The main reason for this is that I was helping to organise a free technology conference in Cork called [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/). BarCamps are neither about booze nor barristers but are grass-roots unconferences where the agenda is only decided on the day by attendees putting themselves forward to speak or to moderate sessions on topics they are interested in.

We had the event on Saturday and it was a huge success. Over 80 people attended from all over Ireland and their backgrounds ranged from college students to programmers to Venture Capitalists. We were thrilled to be able to get tons of sponsorship for everything - the building, the wifi, the food, the drink, the t-shirts, the works!

It made me think that this model of a free adhoc grassroots conference is applicable to far more than just techies talking about the web. And of course I wasn't the first one to have this thought since [WineCamp](http://barcamp.org/WineCamp) was held in California and I see links to [BourbonCamp](http://barcamp.org/BourbonCamp) and [ArtCamp](http://barcamp.org/ArtCamp). 

Rather than having top-down invite-only or pay-through-the-nose events, I highly recommend that people who want to have a get together with like minded others investigate this idea. You could have BookCamp, FoodCamp, FishCamp and with a nod to a very funny gross-out movie: ""This one time, at BandCamp..."".

There is general BarCamp info over at [BarCamp.org](http://barcamp.org/) and the info our our event is at [BarCamp.org/BarCampIreland](http://barcamp.org/BarCampIreland). I ran a blog for a few weeks which you can read over at the [BarCamp blog](http://argolon.com/BarCampIreland/blog). We have the great site set up by one of our sponsors which collects all the blog posts, pictures and links between people. Check it out at [the Backnetwork](http://barcampireland1.backnetwork.com/). If this idea does interest you, feel free to contact me with any questions on arranging them. If you've ever run a kids birthday party, then you are more than capable of arranging a BarCamp.

Nostalgia Week at conoroneill.com,"Given that this blog is six years old this week and [we've started reminiscing about the good old days of Engineering in Merrion Street and Earlsfort Terrace](http://conoroneill.com/2007/04/11/universities-belong-inside-cities/#comment-62217), I've decided that it's officially Nostalgia Week here at O'Neill Towers. 

Knarf reminded me of Jimmy Jamjars at the gates to Merrion Street. Catherine reminded me of The Jimmy Jamjar Awards. I think Teresa won one in 1991 for the largest number of PFOs of any Engineering student.

I nominate our pop-rivetted aluminium boxes which ended up holding bog-roll in Merrion Street as a candidate for best re-use ever."

Not an April Fool,"From yesterday's ElectricNews:

----------------
Irish company Vordel, the XML web services security company, announced the appointment of German firm, SHE-IT as a reseller of its XML security software in the German marketplace. SHE-IT has a strong reputation for delivering security systems integration expertise to leading companies in the financial services, telecoms and industrial sectors in Germany, Vordel claimed.

Not the way to lose your baby teeth,"Poor Oisín is terribly unlucky with his front teeth. When he was 2-ish he fell off a changing table and impacted one of his front teeth up into the bone and split the lip and gum. Nothing could be done except let it heal. That tooth was much shorter than the other one until yesterday. Then yesterday evening, he fell off a stool and did a repeat performance, this time knocking out his other tooth and making a mush of his upper lip again.

Once again, the advice from the doc was to do nothing and let it heal. He rang the dental hospital and they concurred particularly considering they are his baby teeth.

But we are worried about the full teeth and what the likelihood is that they'll come down ok. Anyone else have kids where this happened? I'd hate for the poor mite to have to get implants at an early age. I know too many people with those already.

I hope he gets something nice in town with Catherine today. The tooth fairy gave him a tenner cos she felt so sorry for him."
Now I'm not saying Vodafone read my blog but,"ElectricNews reports that [Vodafone launches flat-rate 3G access](http://www.electricnews.net/news.html?code=9705305).

€49 incl VAT sounds excellent but I'll bet that is on top of a basic plan so there is no way we will end up paying less than €78 EUR per month. Fine if you are in business, silly if you are not. Another wasted opportunity? I'd be ringing them now to sign up if they halved the price.

I think I quoted a tenner as being reasonable. Most of us might stretch to €20 but €49 is yet another gouge attempt by people whole main source of income is a text transmission system designed for system messages.

[tags]Vodafone, 3G, Flat-Rate[/tags]"
Now that I've calmed down,"What a great line-up for the final! Well done to everyone who got through, there is some real quality in there. A ton of my fave Irish blogs are listed. Looking forward to the night of the awards already. Will the concierge mind the baby tho?"
Now THIS is how to make an ad,"The new Vista ad from Microsoft. I think it's an all-time great. Brilliant writing (by Seinfeld I assume). Not once is Vista mentioned, just the logo at the end. 

When you get tired of ""buy buy buy, buy this, NOW, do it now, limited time offer, for you, blah blah blah"", then funny oddball ads like this put a smile on your face. I swear my opinion of Vista has gone up since I've watched this. Now if they did one with George Costanza, I'd go out and buy Vista Ultimate on the spot.

Numb-nut did his permalinks wrong,"None of my recent posts were appearing on [Planet of the Blogs](http://www.planetoftheblogs.com/) and I assumed they were doing something wrong. So I finally mailed them today and they were able to suss that my RSS feeds were all buggered. Why? Because I cannot read simple bloody instructions. I wanted to change from the normal Wordpress link style for posts (e.g. [http://conoroneill.com/?p=178](http://conoroneill.com/?p=178)) to a more meaningful permalink structure ([http://conoroneill.com/2005/11/17/pork-from-china/](http://conoroneill.com/2005/11/17/pork-from-china/)). What did I do? I copied the sample code and forgot to change it for my site. Nitwit. Thanks lads. But even after fixing, the Atom feed is still bunched. So there goes the next hour or two trying to figure out why.

UPDATE: I just got the Atom feed working too. After a ton of googling, it turns out I had to go into the MySQL DB with PHPMyAdmin and hand edit some of the guid entries in the wp_posts table to fix the screwed up old permalink structure. A bit unimpressed that a simple typo in a setting could bugger up the DB like that. But all is well again in Conor-land.

Oh Mio Mai-o,"We've had a couple of very good reviews [of Mio on LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/search?q=mio) and finally got a chance to try it out last Sunday. A brilliant meal in a beautiful but shockingly empty restaurant. We'll be back soon.

Granny Mary shooed us out the door at 5pm on Sunday and we tootled down to Clon to Mio's. Owned by the same people as the brilliant Gleenson's, it is two doors up and upstairs.

[![28092008030](http://photos4.pix.ie/EB/57/EB570D4F18124E95BABEB37E4D39894E-500.jpg)](http://pix.ie/conor/701700 ""28092008030 by conor"") 

The room is beautifully done with a nice Italian feel to the whole place. It was empty on arrival so we got the full attention of the very friendly waiter. A couple of Italian Moretti beers saw us through the meal and we had a hard time deciding what to pick. Both the main menu and specials looked good but with quite run-of-the-mill descriptions, which as as discovered when the food arrived, didn't do it justice at all.

For main I had the Capricciosa pizza which had anchovies, capers, olives and an egg. One of the best pizzas I've eaten in the past ten years. Catherine had a classic Caesar sald with chicken.

Two excellent double espressos finished the evening and we were out off home, fully sated.

Unfortunately not one other person came in whilst we were there. I so hope this was a timing thing and not a regular occurrence since Clon needs a place like this that serves great food in a relaxed setting. I am concerned that the menu outside gives no hint of the high quality of the food and could be mistaken for an Eddie Rockets style place. The prices are a little high but then I say that about everywhere.

If you like great pizza and great food in general but want it in a lovely relaxed welcoming setup then Mio is worth a detour. Next time I'm trying the burger."

Old Chapel Drag Race - w00t !!,"Bloody Brilliant, and we only watched the practice runs.

We positioned ourselves at the finish line on the advice of a steward (""they'll reach max speed there""). It took a while to get going but the organisation of the event was really professional.  Fionn (aged 9 months) screamed every time a bike also screamed across the line. Oisín hid in a buggy, Shibs was unimpressed and Oscar went quiet.

Most of the family left after a few minutes due to the noise, leaving Oscar and myself to enjoy the smell of burning rubber.

I think we have a new annual family event on our calendar. Stunning. I don't think I've ever stood a few yards from a guy doing a wheelie at approx 100mph. Anyone know what speed they were doing across the finish line?

Shutter lag on the camera was terrible so the pictures below are rubbish. I also took some video with the Ixus. Equally bad but gives some sense of the speed.

This bike belonged to a spectator not a racer. 1300cc! Bigger than the average Micra.

One of my career highlights so far was playing a part in the acquisition of FeedHenry by [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com). The day I found out that they were a potential buyer will always stay with me. I have had 2.5 amazing years with them and my opinion has only gone up as time progressed. 

What makes Red Hat special is its culture. They manage to combine an absolute commitment to Open Source with a completely rigorous commercial sensibility. I strongly recommend you read [yesterday's blog post by Paul Cormier](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/blog/what-makes-us-red-hat), President of PnT in Red Hat, on Open Source. 

The reason I've always found nearForm so interesting is that it also has that magical combination of community and commercial, but as a startup. In the coming months we'll be talking a lot more about nearForm's Open Source contributions. It goes far far beyond what most people realise. 

Yet we are also growing at an amazing rate.

One Breast Less,"Catherine discovered Haydn and Roos' latest blog yesterday, it is called [One Breast Less](http://www.onebreastless.com/) and I don't think I need to tell you what it is about.

My granny had a mastectomy due to breast cancer and my aunt has just finished a course of radium so I'll be reading closely. It is blogs like One Breast Less that remind you what a powerful medium blogging really is, one which allows you to get to the heart of a subject without ever needing to think about a publisher or demographics. 

Haydn's recent writing has got me thinking (but not doing yet) a lot about diet. As soon as Catherine is getting a decent nights sleep we'll switch back to the healthy us as we usually do after each baby. I'll be using a lot of the information on [The Diet Cast](http://www.thedietcast.com/) and [My Diet Friends](http://www.mydietfriends.com/) for that.

Opportunity for a Property Developer,"Now that's a phrase you didn't expect to hear in the current economic climate.

One of the reasons we settled on Bandon when we moved to Cork was the classic location, location, location. It really is ideally situated in Munster for access to almost everything - Cork City, Airport, beaches, businesses, school, sports facilities etc etc.

However, this prime location is missing something critical - somewhere people can meet in a modern business context. Whether it's for seminars, conferences, training or bigger community events, we have nothing. There are many organisations (state, semi-state and private enterprise), who would kill for a venue where people from all corners of Munster, Ireland and Europe could meet and get to easily.

The beneficial knock-on effects to other local businesses of having a regular stream of visitors are obvious. At the moment, all that business traffic goes to the city, Clon, Skibb, Kinsale and elsewhere.

Otto's Creative Catering - One of our top 5 meals of all time,"I'm not going to be able to put into proper words how fantastic the meal in [OCC in Dunworley](http://ottos-creative-catering.com/) was last night. We just can't stop talking about it. Perfection from start to finish. But first some history:

When we moved to Bandon two years ago, I asked around about good restaurants in the area. The general consensus was that none of the ones in Bandon were great but that Otto's in Dunworley was fantastic. A few months later I did a foray down there to see where it was and to check out the beach. I thought the road would never end. Finally, just as we arrived exactly in the middle of nowhere, I saw the entrance. We kept going and went down to the beach which is fabulous - small, rocky, interesting, fantastic views. 

[![IMG_1236](http://static.flickr.com/33/42267008_32255de0f3_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/42267008/ ""Photo Sharing"")

So for the next 18 months, we said ""we must we must"" but the drive down that twisty road late at night was putting us off. Then last christmas C&T gave us a voucher for a meal for two there as a thank-you. We continued on with ""we must we must"". A few weeks back, Catherine and her sis Paula decided to have a day of pampering in Inchydoney (they left 30 minutes ago and all 4 children are still alive - even if Sib&eacute;al's lip is bleeding). Paula, the saint, offered to mind our darlings last night so we could head out. One problem is the cost of cabs to get anywhere. Cork is &euro;40, Clon is &euro;25, Kilbrittain is &euro;20 and Dunworley is &euro;30 - all of those are each way! We initially went for Casino house but they were booked out. Then we copped ourselves on and realised that if we did Otto's then we were only paying for the taxi (and booze). So off we went.

The restaurant is up a rutted track through their organic farm. Being on a headland, they have wind-breaks everywhere to help with growing all the produce they use in the restaurant. I'm guessing they have had lots of chats with Joy Larkom, the famous vegetable gardening writer who moved down to the same area in the past few years to retire. She has written several articles since on her wind-break efforts.

The house is beautiful. Looks old and stonewashed but you realise pretty quickly that it is a modern house with (as Hilda put it herself) ""not a straight line in the building). The welcome was really friendly with Otto himself taking the order. I noticed a copy of the Bridgestone Guide on the coffee table in the waiting area. I don't think they should leave it there. The review of their restaurant is the greatest pile of ""right-on"" horseshite I have read in years. At least they did actually mention the food towards the end.

They encourage people to bring their own wine and they don't charge corkage - how many other places do that? I guessed they might have a few organic wines available so we didn't bring any. They had a very short list of cheap (&euro;20) organic and bio-dynamic ones. We went with bio-dynamic Riesling and it was fabulous (both bottles :-)).

On to the menu. Exactly the kind of thing I was expecting - good simple dishes made with their own produce. Lots of salads in the starters and then steaks, pork, fish, offal in the mains. I'd have been happy to eat anything on the menu.

For starters Catherine had a smoked Gubbeen salad and I had a selection of salamis made from their own animals in the Gubbeen smokehouse. As I said at the start, words fail me in trying to describe how fabulous these dishes were. Every single mouthful was an explosion of different intense flavours. The salami was the best I have ever tasted (beating Gubbeen's own offerings in Urru). The salads and the dressing should win awards for perfection. Hilda said we could lick our plates if we liked. I pretty much did that by mopping up every single dribble on the plate with the bread. There is simply no comparison between the quality and flavour of their ingredients straight from the garden and the sort of chlorine-doused salad we now all buy in a supermarket.

We were worried initially that we were going to be the only diners for the night but there was only one free table by the end. The only slightly grating note was the preponderance of Dublin accents (including our own mangled Cork-Cavan-Kilkenny-Wicklow-Meath-Dublin accents). 

Catherine skipped the soup course but I had the consomm&eacute;. I was half-expecting it to be pretty insipid like every other one I have ever had. But this thing had a taste kick like the bullock it came from. Wow. I heard them tell another table that it takes four days to make. I'm not surprised.

Whilst waiting for the mains, I noticed the lovely vine-like plant which covered the entire ceiling of the dining area, which we now realised was a conservatory. Then my eyes refocused across the room - ""oh my god, there are grapes hanging from those vines"". Without a doubt the coolest thing I have ever seen in a restaurant. We had some of them later in our dessert.

Onto the main courses - Catherine had monkfish and sole with a crab cream and I had braised ox-tongue. Both utterly gorgeous. I had been concerned that I was trying to be he-man by going for the tongue but it just melted in the mouth (there is some sort of weird double entendre in that sentence). And for the first time ever in a restaurant, we both kept shoveling into the veg which was a meal in its own right. This is in comparison to most places with their poxy side dish of microwaved mange-tout and other scrag-ends.

Catherine had a selection of ice-creams and a fruit salad mix for desert. Mine was similar - sorbet with fruit salad. Again, the intensity of the flavours was just joyous. Lip-smacking all the way through.

Throughout all of this, the service was wonderfully friendly and attentive but without that horrible obsequiousness that you get in upper-end restaurants in Dublin. We were already planning what we were going to eat on the next visit before we left.

The menu is a fixed price &euro;50 per head. If they were doing food of this quality in Dublin it would easily (and rightly) be double that. They do offer the restaurant for functions and they also do B&B. I'm already thinking about our 10th Wedding Anniversary in two years and my 40th in (oh dear god no) two and three quarter years.

We have two Nokia-crap-cam pictures. One is of the vines which I'll post when I get Catherine's phone off her. The other is the bannister down to the loos - perfection in house design.

Our Food Past or Our Food Future?,"I was given this heavy tome by the publishers to review and months later I'm finally getting my thoughts down. Whilst it is a fantastic collection of recipes and information that all Irish cooks should own, I fear that along with Darina's Forgotten Skills of Cooking, we are looking at our past.

[![](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/9780811866705_norm.jpg ""The Country Cooking of Ireland"")](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/9780811866705_norm.jpg)

The author Colman Andrews is a very well known food-writer and co-founder of the famed Saveur magazine in the US. This may look like a coffee-table staple but it is genuinely jammed with lots of recipes that could easily have been lost forever.

It's clear reading the book that Colman is not claiming to be an expert in Irish food since he defers to many of the Irish greats like Darina and profiles some of our Irish food heroes like Anthony down the road in Ummera. The only time this becomes a problem is when he refers to things being very common when I know that they are small-scale and highly-localised.  The perfect example is fraughan gathering. This is presented as something many people do. The reality is that 95% of the population would have no idea what a fraughan is and most of those live in boggy country areas. Their parents or grandparents may have gathered them but they are now buying Chilean strawberries in SuperValu.

This leads to the biggest problem I ran into when reading it. Quite simply it does not reflect mainstream current Irish eating or food. It is a lens on our food history and it tells us what foodies, Slow Food people and gurus like Myrtle or Darina are interested in, but it has no relationship to where most people are now.

My mother was flicking through it recently and ran into a word I had never heard of: stir-about. It's an old word for porridge. Neither she nor my father had heard it for decades. This is a perfect example of what we are losing as we ""modernize"".

I don't see this as a problem with the book, I see it as a problem with us. Is our future going to be 100% Tesco-ized? Everything pre-prepared, cooked and packaged? Or Tesco-Finest for those with money? Is U.S.-style obesity heading our way? Is the idea of cooking with incredibly small budgets using things like cheap cuts of meat gone and replaced with take-aways and extruded shapes?

Anyone who reads this blog know I love food and love seeing artisan produce do well but at the back of my mind I worry we have gone from ""proper food"" being something everyone ate, due to economic necessity, to something utterly middle-class and slightly sniffy.

The current recession should be an opportunity for this type of cooking to come back but the skills are gone. Is there any hope? What could be done in the education system to bring these skills back?

Having stupid men on the sides of buses telling us how easy it is to cook certainly isn't the answer either. How about replacing compulsory Irish in schools with compulsory cooking? Imagine a government doing something audacious now to solve a future health epidemic whilst finally admitting failure in an 80 year language effort.

Apologies for such a negative post about such a great book but I think I've been depressed since watching Food Inc. Movies like that along with efforts like Jamie Oliver's and Hugh F-W's are mainly just preaching to the converted. How do we convert those who could benefit most from a return to the past?

Colman's book is not the solution but at least it is helping to preserve the knowledge.

In case the review was lost in my brain-dump above, this is a superb book. If you want a broad sweep of traditional Irish cooking you should buy it."
Our Peach Harvest,"Here it is:

"Patrick Kevin Pierce, RIP.","Aged 22, Patrick died in his sleep last monday night. He was buried at Shanganagh Cemetery yesterday after a heart-breaking funeral mass in Shankill. I didn't know Patrick that well, I met him maybe once or twice a year when visiting Eoin and Jill. But the short life of this young man should be celebrated as a example of achievement in the face of overwhelming adversity.

Nine years ago, Patrick was hit by a car and suffered massive head trauma. He was not expected to live. He spent 4 months in a coma. It took one and a half years for him to start re-learning how to speak and how to walk. Many of us would have given up and resigned ourselves to a silent life in a wheel-chair being waited on hand and foot. Not Patrick! With willpower the size of a planet, he refused to consider himself disabled and improved both his physical adeptness and speech clarity day by day. 

It was a humbling experience listening to Patrick speak. Initially I couldn't make out very much, then I suddenly realised that everything was being done perfectly apart from the speed. It was like a strectched audio tape. If you simply slowed down the rate at which you expected to receive each sound, you could understand everything he said. And he was one funny wee bloke when you did listen!  His sense of humour was obviously completely untouched by the accident. I often wondered if he was trying to push his thoughts through a damaged speech-centre or if his brain has re-used some other part of itself to provide speech functions. Either way it was a joy to encounter.

At his eulogy yesterday, his Dad said that Patrick always did whatever the hell he set his mind to and as a result, he fell nearly every day. I've seen some of those falls and they were frightening to be near. But he simply got himself up as if nothing had happened, dusted himself down and continued on doing whatever it was he was trying to do. I don't think any of us will forget that protective hat he had for all those years.

Patrick could not have achieved everything that he did without the enormous sacrifices made by his parents Pat and Barbara. Every parent is going to do their best for their baby boy but seeing what they did for Patrick made us all realise what parenting under extreme pressure really means. I am very sad for the pain that Patrick's siblings are feeling right now. No-one should have to lose a little brother so suddenly. But, as a parent myself,  I am deeply upset for his parents and the grief that they are experiencing after 9 years of ""living on borrowed time"" as his Dad put it.

Whilst we rightly criticise the dreadful money wasting in our health service, the serives provided to Patrick in his rehabilitation were world class by all accounts and once again I heard nothing but praise for the [NRH](http://www.nrh.ie/).

I had never encountered [The Peter Bradley Foundation](http://www.peterbradleyfoundation.ie/) until yesterday. Long may they help young adults like Patrick achieve the independence that they yearn for and deserve.

In the modern world our kids have a multitude of nonsense role-models to pick from. I dread the day one of my boys tells me he wants to be David Beckham. If (and when) they do, I'll be telling them all about young Patrick Pierce and the nature of true character.

My deepest sympathies to all of the Pierce family and to Patrick's many friends."
Peter Schiff and why we'll remain screwed,"Many of you have seen this video on YouTube where investment expert Peter Schiff is shown many times on US TV in 2006-2007 explaining why the US was in a property bubble and why it was all going to collapse. If you haven't seen it, it's hilarious and depressing at the same time.

{{< youtube 2I0QN-FYkpw >}}

I don't claim to know much about investing but when we were moving from Dublin to Cork in 2003 and saw that our house had increased in value more than 400% in 9 years, we took the money and ran. Even in 2003 the valuations seemed idiotic. By 2007 they were in the realms of fantasy land. Of course many people told us we were stupid and if we'd rented the house out in Dublin we'd have made another €200k minimum when we went to sell. But when would we have sold? 2005? 2006? Or, gawd 'elp us, 2008? Did I mention we sold our Eircom shares after 2 weeks? Maybe we do know what we are doing!

Then today I listened to this podcast of [Peter Schiff speaking at the 2009 Austrian Scholar's Conference](http://www.lewrockwell.com/podcast/?p=episode&name=2009-03-15_104_why_was_anyone_surprised_by_the_crash.mp3). It's long but utterly riveting. You think the worst is over? You think G20 is going to sort it all out? Listen to this and be afraid, be very afraid."
"Phew, nearly missed July","It's been said by many others too but [Twitter](http://twitter.com/conoro/) is seriously denting my blogging. Why write an entire post when most of the time 140 chars will do?

But what will be remembered and found in years to come? Watching Chris Moyles on ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" really drove home the importance of historical records. My mother ran into a brick wall with her genealogy research a few years ago once she got into the 19th Century.

It'd be nice if in 100 years there is still something resembling the internet and all of this ""stuff"" that we are all generating on Blogs, Twitter, Facebook etc etc can be found and read by our descendants so they can realise what a bunch of weirdos and wackos they share their genes with.

And on a completely different subject, here are some pics of the veg plot. Total effort expended in weeding and planting this year? Approx 8 hours.

Philips USB Speaker Hell means Cisco becomes the Google of my living room?,"The speakers on the Acer Laptop are a bit puny, particularly for playing DVDs. Unfortunately, the machine does not have a line out, so I decided to get a pair of USB speakers. I didn't need anything particularly special and they had to be just a bog-standard stereo pair due to lack of space. A bit of browsing on Dabs brought up the[ Philips DGX220 Speakers](http://www.dabs.com/ProductView.aspx?QuickLinx=3H8N) at a nice n cheap &pound;23\. 
I received them a few weeks back and was happy to discover that they need no special drivers - XP just handles them out of the box.

Except it didn't.

Weeks of fiddling ensued with no success. The USB composite device would be found and the drivers would load, causing the power light to come on but the install of the USB Audio Drivers always failed with ""cannot find suitable drivers for device"". Nights of googling produced nothing. These are obviously not a popular product as there are almost no links to them anywhere.

I tried everything - install, uninstall, direct connect, hub connect, scour the philips site, scour all the USB sites. But to no avail.

This evening I had one final go. The various discussions of USB speakers in general all indicated that I had to have usbaudio.sys in C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers. I didn't but I did find a copy in C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386, so I copied that over. But that was not enough because I needed an INF file to allow Windows to install the driver and there did not appear to be any file called usbaudio.inf anywhere. A bit more googling brought up a discussion of a Siemens M34A Cordless Audio thingy. Totally unrelated to my speakers but one guy mentioned the use of a file called wdma_usb.inf in C:\WINDOWS\inf. Of course I did not have that either. But I did find wdma_usbinf.bak. Why the hell is that there? Who knows. I renamed it to wdma_usb.inf, unplugged and replugged the speaker and went through the install process, obviosuly picking the ""manual route"" and pointed the device install wizard to the INF file, annnnnnd, it worked!

For gods sake, PCs will never become ubiquitous with their own spot in the living room as long as rubbish like this happens. When I co-founded Advanticus back in 2002, it was on the basis that we were heading into the era of digital convergence where the consumer electronics guys like Sony and Matsushita would deliver on the vision rather than the PC manufacturers. We were just a bit early. 

Cisco obviously believe it too as they have just [dished out $5.3 Billion for Scientific Atlanta](http://www.forbes.com/technology/2005/11/18/cisco-scientific-atlanta-takeover-cx_ck_1118cisco.html). If only Sony and Co would get their act together, they would leave Microsoft/Dell/Intel/HP and their buddies in the dust. However due to  their obsession with DRM (and look what a fine mess that just got Sony into) and controlling the consumer, maybe the winner for living room space will come from left-field and we'll all be converged on our Cisco Home Centers in 3 years time. I've just realised that the Linksys purchase was probably the first step in this. 

Ye know, the tech news worlds blinkered focus on Google/Yahoo/Microsoft/Web2.0 may cause them to miss the huge elephant in the room. Maybe it is time to dip my toe back in the cruel world of the stock market and put more money where my mouth is.

Photos from Farmer's Market on Riya,"Like many geeks, I signed up for [Riya ](http://www.riya.com/)the moment they went into public beta. This is a photo sharing site like many others (e.g. [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/)) but with the twist that it has advanced ""AI"" techniques for recognising faces. So if you upload many pictures of the same people and train Riya a bit, then in future it will be automatically able to recognise those people in future photos and tag them accordingly for search purposes.

Along with the usual sharing features like tagging and albums etc, it is a pretty sweet service. It is still under development and to be honest, I find it very confusing to use. The whole training vs viewing vs sharing is very fuzzy.

For the laugh I used all the photos I took at the Farmer's Market and uploaded them and identified the people whose names I knew. So apologies to Anthony, Don, Ruth, Frank and Dianne but  you've been framed :-)

Obviously, if you really object, then I'll delete the identifiers.

"Pictures, Camera Phones, Picture Editing and that Internet ","At this stage a huge number of people have camera phones and actually use the camera to take those impromptu pictures. I remember asking why anyone would want a camera phone three years ago. What the hell would you take pictures of? Well, it turns out I had no imagination and I now take pictures of everything and anything.

Now most people take the picture and either send it by MMS to friends n family or just show it on the phone to people later. But there is a lot more you can do with them and most of those things are free. The main thing you need to do is to get the pictures off the phone and onto a PC or a web-site. Whilst the network operators here still think it makes sense to gouge us on mobile data charges, the option of sending directly to the web doesn't really make sense here. 

But if you are loaded, then you can do things like:

*   Install [Shozu](http://www.shozu.com/) on your phone and send all your pictures to the photo sharing site Flickr
*   O2 customers can sign up for [foneblog.ie](http://www.foneblog.ie/) and send pictures to that site
*   If you have a Wordpress blog, install [Postie](http://www.economysizegeek.com/?page_id=395) and send pictures from your phone via email to your blog

If you aren't so flush, then there are a lot of fun free things you can do. First tho, you need either a data cable for your phone or a bluetooth adapter for your PC (if your phone has bluetooth). I recommend the cable as bluetooth is the most unreliable slow piece of rubbish ever to leave Scandinavia since the Volvo 480\. For most modern Nokias that is the DKU-5 or CA-53 cable. If your phone didn't come with one, they are on [ebay.ie](http://www.ebay.ie/) for €4 incl P&P. You'll pay a fortune for one in a mobile phone shop so don't bother.

Then you need the Nokia PC Suite software. Another unreliable Scandinavian but has lots of nice things like phone backup which you should really use in case your phone is nicked. This is free and there is a link to it on [Nokia.ie](http://www.nokia.ie/)

I also really like the [Nokia Lifeblog](http://www.nokia.com/lifeblog) software. This grabs all the pictures, videos and text messages from your phone and shows them to you as a timeline. Looks really cool. In theory you can then publish what you want to your blog but for some nutso reason, it only supports Movable Type blogs and not Blogger or Wordpress. I just use it as an easy way of grabbing all the piccies off the phone and uploading the ones I want onto [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/).

So you've got the cable and software installed and managed to download your pictures to your PC. Now what? Well you can put them up on a photo-sharing site like [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) or [Zooomr](http://beta.zooomr.com/home) or [Photobucket](http://www.photobucket.com/) to spread the love. You can set the privacy on pictures on most of these sites so only those you invite can see them. I use Flickr and the free account is pretty good. I pay a few bob for a Pro account which allows me to upload as much as I like. There you can discover simple but powerful ideas like tagging where you add some labels to your photos like ""cork"" or ""hurling"" and then click on ""hurling"" to find all the other pictures on the site with the same label.

You've got your Flickr account and you've uploaded some pictures and you're sharing them with your friends but you think ""damn, I wish I could cut the edge of that picture and remove the red-eye on that other one"". The solution comes winging its way to you from Ballincollig in Cork in the shape of [PXN8](http://pxn8.com/) from [Sxoop Technologies](http://sxoop.com/). This brilliant piece of software allows you to edit pictures on your PC or your Flickr account inside a web-browser! You really have to check it out. It's one of those ""why the hell didn't I think of that?"" sites. No need for special photo editing software on your PC. You could edit the pictures in an internet cafe in Vietnam if you want. And it is easy to use too, check it out. And I'm not just saying that cos I know Walter, this is an awesome bit of software. It'll soon let you add text to the pictures too so you can do wee postcards or posters for people.

And all this from taking a piccie on your camera phone whilst out having a walk. Isn't that internet just the bees knees?

I saw ""The Matador"" on a plane recently and raved about it. Catherine got it out on DVD last night and it still works on a second viewing. It is the story of a hitman with problems played by Pierce Brosnan, who befriends an average joe played by Greg Kinnear. The movie is full of wonderful dark one liners and some fabulous scenes.

As a movie, you'll enjoy it immensely but what will blow you away is Brosnan. He acts everyone else off the screen - seriously! He has finally realised that slick and suave is far more interesting when mixed with sleazy and he just nails his character. The scene where he strides through the hotel looking completely screwed-up wearing nothing but black jocks and ankle boots will stay with me for many years to come.

Playground in Leap - What's the story?,"Headed down to Skibb the morning for a few reasons: give the demon children a sleep, get some fish for a fish pie, go to the excellent playground there.
On the way I noticed a fabulous playground in Leap. Beautiful wooden structures all inside a big metal fence. But then I noticed the sign on the gate ""closed until further notice"". Anyone know why? If it is due to insurance then I'll be forced to go to the nearest courthouse, find a savage claiming compo and headbutt them.

How about all responsible citizens sign a disclaimer in perpetuity? ""I the undersigned do hereby undertake never to sue the organs of the state when either I or my children hurt themselves making use of state property. In addition I shall strive to seek out those parasites who make the lives of all the rest of us more expensive with their professional victimhood and their constant sueing of the state because of the activities of their numbskull children and I shall encourage them to move to the Blasket islands where they can set up a commune and all sue each other"".

Of course, maybe the playground just isn't finished yet.

Please someone make a documentary on TB hospitals in Ireland,"Four years ago I wrote [a quick throwaway post](http://conoroneill.com/2009/01/17/tb-hospitals-in-ireland/) about TB hospitals in Ireland. For whatever reason it bubbles up very close to the top of any google search on that topic. As a result, I have set of comments there which just have to be read. All of them are interesting, many are heartbreaking. The majority are written by people who were either in such a hospital or had a relation in one.

I implore someone to take this information and do a proper documentary on it before it's too late and all of these people are gone. These stories have been hidden for far too long, just like so many other parts of our 20th century history in Ireland.

Is anyone out there up to the task?

Poacher's Inn Tapas Night. Staggeringly good. Epic in fact.,"For a good few years, this blog was all about food. I had lots of restaurant reviews and foodie pics and experiments like making sausages. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, I haven't done much in that area for a long time. Whilst I've eaten lots of lovely food since then, I haven't had much that was truly memorable. Until Friday night.

My parents were down for a visit and we planned to go to [The Poacher's Inn](https://www.facebook.com/poachersinnbandon) with them and big sis, but when we went to book we were told the Tapas night was starting at 8pm and it was only a very limited menu before that. As we hate to eat late, we decided to go to Bandon's other superb restaurant, [Chapel Steps](http://www.chapelsteps.ie/). We figured it wouldn't be too busy around 6.30pm and we didn't bother book a table. Boy were we wrong. They were jammed and didn't have a table free when we arrived. Whilst it was a disappointment for us, I was thrilled for Siobhan and the team. They've got an absolute winner on their hands now.

So back to Poacher's and not only did they have a table, they were happy to give us the Tapas menu early. I was chuffed! We ordered a clatter of plates for sharing. We knew we had to be out by 8pm and were relieved when the plates started coming thick and fast.

Not a single dud. Not one. Everything was gorgeous and lots of it was surprising. The tempura oysters with pepper sauce were a revelation. The sauce on the whole prawns was completely addictive. I could go on and on about the tastes but I think a few pictures are called for. Apologies for the rubbish picture quality. It was quite dark and I couldn't find the option to turn on the flash as a light in the camera app on the phone.

Superb olives:

By 7.30pm I think we'd tried everything on the menu. And then we had the desserts. That thing with the granita was the nicest sweet I've had in years. Seriously.

The others raved about this dessert too:

Rory told us that it was just a one-off experiment but can I implore Poacher's to do this regularly? I know it had 5 chefs flat-out all night Friday so maybe once a month? And have it all night rather than the big-bang at 8pm? We haven't eaten out much recently and it's food like this that will get us out the door regularly.

When we first moved to Bandon, we were told that there were no good restaurants here because it was too close to Cork. So everyone went to Cork or Kinsale to eat. But Urru, Poacher's and Chapel Steps have proven that was bullcrap and was just an excuse for mediocrity in the past.

If we get another couple of places of this quality in the town, it will become a serious foodie destination and rightly call itself the new gourmet capital of Cork."

But then this is Nestle, so it probably does contain plutonium.

Pork from China?,"I set up Google Analytics and AdSense on this web-site for no real reason other than messin. Watching the ads that appear could become a full-time hobby. 

Most of them are as expected - ""Holidays in Donegal or Galway"". I've had a few ""buy sausages and herbs from us"". But one made me do a click-thru on my own site: ""Buy Pork"". 

Hmm interesting. Then I read the detail of the site a little closer, ""Buy Pork from China""!

Ye know, I'd almost be tempted by ""Frozen Pork Sides Origined in Shandong province, China with high quality"". I don't know if I could have a communist in the house tho.

Pork and Sons Review,"I was given this lovely book for Christmas 2007 and finally finished it last month. What initially appears to be a coffee-table resident turned out to be one of the best books on food I've ever read.

The title says it all. This is a book about pork. Every single bit of the pig gets a mention and use. The author, Stéphane Reynaud is the grandson of a village butcher from the Ardeche plateau in France. He runs a restaurant near Paris that specialises in Pork. I want to eat there!

![](http://www.phaidon.com/porkandsons/images/PorkandSons.gif ""Pork and Sons"")

The recipes themselves are fantastic but so too are the notes, anecdotes and pictures and people. This is a book centered on the relationship between a community and its food. The way it is sectioned up is unusual but it works. The ""chapters"" are as follows:

*   Pig-killing time at Saint-Agreve
*   Black Pudding Recipes
*   For the love of Sausages
*   Sausage Recipes
*   Hamming it up
*   Ham Recipes
*   Pates and Terrines
*   Jacquy's terrine
*   Granny Pig
*   Barbecued Pig
*   A piggy Party
*   Wild Boar
It's been quite a while since I've read a cookery book which stirred up such desire to cook but this did it. Whilst I know recession-talk is starting to wear people down, this book will hopefully be part of a return to cooking cheap tasty food with a bit of soul."

Potential - Not everyone gets to be an Astronaut when they grow up,"I'll be reading this site all day.

Consulting - if you're not a part of the solution, there is good money to be made in prolonging the problem.

[Despair Inc.](http://www.despair.com/demotivators/indem.html)"
Project Lifecycle,"I was sent this a while back and I laughed my ass off. Inspired single cartoon summary of my working life for the past 13 years. Check it out:

[Deepak Alur's Blog](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/alur/20050408#project_life_cycle_friday_humor ""Deepak Alur"")"
Quack Quack Quack. Homeopathy doesn't work shocker,"The [BBC has an article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4183916.stm) on the most recent study of Homeopathy showing, yet again, that it is no better than placebo. 

Whilst I consider most alternative therapies to be rubbish being pushed by idiots and charlatans, Homeopathy has managed to inhabit that grey zone where one doesn't want to completely dismiss it.   This was down to a few factors - the fact that it has been around for a long time, the fact that they do seem to get some form of results and finally the desire of those who have followed a formal course of study to be officially recognised and to not allow actual charlatans to calls themselves homeopaths.

&nbsp;A friend of ours is a qualified homeopath By 'qualified', I mean that she followed a formal course for several years and was subject to examinations etc. As opposed to someone who  read a book about it once .. She genuinely believes that homeopathy works. We had a great night a few years back where I had a few drinks and decided to  have a go . We argued back and forth. My main point was that the recent (at the time) James Randi programme had done a proper double-blind test and homeopathy had failed miserably. Her response to this was that she thought there were some  subtleties in succussion  which caused it to fail. This is another way of saying  they shook the water wrong . 

Her belief in the efficacy of the treatment in general unfortunately came across as faith-based rather than fact-based. I was accused of having science as my religion. My point was that science is based around hypothesis, analysis and correction. Homeopathy is based around a set of theories which they refuse to test and validate. 

To be fair, she has treated a lot of people and has seen lots of success. Success of course is very subjective in the world of alternative medicine. To quote the brother of a friend of mine who is a consultant in Vincents -  Alternative medicine that works is just called medicine .

Belief in Homeopathy is one thing, but our friend was also unwilling to criticise any other form of alternative medicine. I guess once you are in the gang you don't want to rock the boat. This includes not accepting criticism of crystal therapy or those morons who hold vials of substances over your belly and can tell if you are allergic to them by how your body reacts to the presence of the vial.

But, to prove how  open-minded  I am, I agreed that I would attend a homeopath to see what they could do for my disastrous stomach which has pumped excess acid every day since I was 16 years old. Only one drug has ever stopped it completely and that is Nexium which you get as part of the triple-treatment for H-Pylori. Sadly, the symptoms returned as soon  as the course was over.  To keep the test fair, I went to another homeopath instead of my friend.

The session went exactly how I expected it to go. Immediate focus on  do you worry much ,  are you protective of your family  etc etc. It went on a for a good hour or two and of course I ended up with a warm fuzzy feeling that the homeopath  cares . She prescribed a course of X, Y and Z. Several variations of diluted water in fact. I took the course - outcome: zero change in symptoms. Re-visit, another set of water vials prescribed - outcome: zero change in symptoms. At this point my patience with happy clappy water had run out and I declined any further  treatments .

Now to provide a balanced picture, we also brought Oscar to have his dry skin and (non-severe) eczema looked at around the same time. In his case there was a definite improvement in symptoms over several months. A score for homeopathy possibly? Well, all the other kids had similar dry skin and they all grew out of it too without treatment. The fact the the treatment also occurred as we moved from spring to summer means we did not have a solid baseline in terms of clothes, heat and sunshine.

As I said, I don't totally dismiss homeopathy, but until the apply proper scientific analysis to what they are doing, it will always remain outside of the mainstream. The final quote in the BBC article from the homeopathy movement is very telling:  <font size=""2"">It has been established beyond doubt and accepted by many researchers, that the placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial is not a fitting research tool with which to test homeopathy.  i.e.&nbsp; we're special, we don't obey the laws of physics and repeatable action-reaction. As long as they think like this, they shall continue to be called quacks.

I have a theory on why is works sometimes. It is the same reason I think Chiropractic worked for me. Chiropractic has two sides to it - the bone manipulation to solve back problems and the  medicine  side. I had great results with sorting out a very sore back that I was suffering from. I did a re-visit in the new year (around 2002) and the guy started messing with this new hammer like thing on various parts of my body. After analysis, he decided that I was dehydrated. An amazing diagnosis considering I had been drinking all christmas. Even more amazingly, several others I know who went to him around the same time were also dehydrated. Must have been an epidemic! He then started doing other diagnoses and at that point I'm afraid I had to stop seeing him. I'm not paying good money for someone to press one finger against my heart and one against my liver and say  oh you are dehydrated .

John Diamond wrote a great book on alternative medicine (sadly unfinished) called  [Snake Oil and Other Preoccupations](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099428334/qid=1127032875/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/026-9605837-5154061) , as he was dying from throat cancer. There is a great quote in there from the chiropractors  double-blind? Oh yeah, we always fail those . Give me patience with charlatans.

So why did Chiropractic work for me? Because it pushed me to fix myself.&nbsp; After a session I would walk down the street slightly sore but erect of posture. For the entire treatment I was making huge efforts to improve how I sat in work, how my chair was adjusted and how I set up my PC. These are things I would not have bothered with unless I had gone to have my back seen. So I have no issue with handing over cash to those guys for my back because in an indirect way, they did fix me. The reverse was true with homeopathy. If I had taken it seriously at all and got caught up in the whole  holistic vibe , then you can be sure I would have given up coffee, spicy food and excess alcohol and I would have seen a major improvement in the state of my stomach and thus homeopathy would have  cured me . 

If it was just well intentioned quackery for non-serious ailments then we should leave them be. But as long as savages like that wan in the West (who should be in jail for manslaughter) are out there telling seriously ill people to avoid real medicine, then we must formalise the control of all forms of alternative medicine in this country.

Quick Health Round-Up on Stomachs and Nuts,"Run off my feet this week so blogging has been even lighter than usual. Two health related stories caught my eye:

[Discoverers of H.Pylori get Nobel Prize](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4304290.stm)

This is fantastic. I've had the treatment and unfortunately it appears I am in the 10% for whom the little bastard bacteria are not the problem. My problem is more likely to be Curry, Coffee and Sauvignon Blanc. 

The discovery that Helicobacter Pylori is responsible for the majority of stomach ulcers is often used by the alternative medicine brigade to beat up ""traditional"" medicine. It was originally found in 1982 but it took until the late 90's before it became accepted as fact. Treatment is a simple three way drug course for two weeks (two anti-biotics and Nexium - the stomach drug of the gods). 

The quacks would claim that mainstream medicine tried to suppress it as they are all in thrall to the drug companies and one dose of three drugs generates a lot less income than a lifetime on Tagamet or Zantac. In fact, mainstream medicine simply insisted that proper scientific testing was done on the hypothesis (including the dreaded double-blind testing that most alternative medicines fall down on). After years of research and testing and trials, it was proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that H Pylori is the baddie in most cases (not over-active acid-producing cells). Most doctors now send those suffering from bad stomach complaints for a test and then treat accordingly. 

Yayy Science!!

Quick reviews of Inov-8 X-CLAW 275 trail runners and Leki Voyager poles,"One thing I've learned as I've dipped my toe into off-road running in Ireland is that we don't really do trails. Apart from forest paths, the bulk of what I've found is wet muddy bog. This causes me two problems - it's difficult to run in it and American-style trail runners are useless in this environment. My poor Altra Lone Peak 3.0 may as well be slick tyres coming down from Mullaghmesha Mountain.

## Ellis Brigham
I was in London a few weeks ago for work and discovered that there is a superb outdoor shop called [Ellis Brigham](https://www.ellis-brigham.com/) in Covent Garden. They have a large selection of Salomon and Inov-8 trail runners, which are designed for the more mud-centric Euro terrain. I was very impressed by the help I got there. It really is a great store and the prices are RRP without any of the uplift you'd expect from that location. 

## Shoe fit and sizing
My concern with all the Salomons is that the reviews say they have a narrow fit. The same is true for a lot of the Inov-8s which are described as ""precision fit"". I don't think I have particularly wide feet but when you have spent years in Vibrams and then Altras, anything narrow feels very constricting. It's taken me a few months to feel completely comfortable in my Skechers GoRun 5 and that's after my little toes were destroyed in the Brighton Marathon.

The other concern in general with running shoes is sizing. I continue to be annoyed by the almost random sizes put on running shoes. I can be anything from 8.5 to 9.5 UK based on the individual model within one brand.

## Inov-8 X-CLAW 275
I trawled through every model that Inov-8 makes on their web-site. My requirements were Standard not Precision fit, not overly large drop and very deep 8mm lugs. Only one model fits that description perfectly, the [X-CLAW 275](https://www.inov-8.com/row/x-claw-275-mens-trail-running-shoes-black/). I emailed ahead to make sure Ellis Brigham had some of my possible sizes in stock in Covent Garden. They did. Once I got there, the big surprise was that a small size fit me perfectly without pinching.

![X-CLAW 275 Clean](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-06-09%2021.41.31.jpg)

The advice from the guy in the store was to avoid hard surfaces or the lugs would wear out quickly. However the site says they are multi-surface with a mix of medium and hard compounds.

## Leki Voyager poles
As we were settling up, I asked what was the cost of the absolute cheapest walking/running poles they had. I've wanted to try out poles for ages but I'm not spending £120+ to discover I hate them. He showed me the [Leki Voyager](https://www.leki.co.uk/trekking-poles-c192/leki-voyager-walking-sticks-pair-p1177) ones at £44 a pair and they seemed fine to me. Rubberised grips and aluminium body. He then showed me a pair of £120 carbon ones for comparison. They weighed almost nothing. I decided feck-it, let's get the cheap ones and see how it goes.

![Leki Voyager](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/leki_voyager.jpg)

I got back to the hotel and then realised I was a moron. How do you fit two poles into carry-on luggage? Luckily you can completely disassemble the Lekis and they fit at a squeeze diagonally in reasonably tall luggage. I gritted my teeth going through LHR x-ray but they didn't bat an eyelid. Hurrah!

## Mullaghmesha Mountain testing
I [wrote recently](http://conoroneill.com/2017/05/01/conors-roundup-of-recent-runs/) about our Mullaghmesha Mountain excitement. Yesterday I decided to have another go. Yup, after a night of torrential rain and ongoing howling wind, I committed to making the same mistake twice.

![Trail Start](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/YDXJ0052.JPG)

This time I drove up the tiny lane beside the castle at 10mph to avoid wearing out those lugs. I parked at the start of the off-road piece of the [Castledonovan Loop](http://www.activeme.ie/guides/walks/castledonovan-loop-walk-drimoleague-west-cork-ireland/) and headed out with the poles and my new Yi II action cam + gimbal (reviews of those coming shortly).

The grip on the Inov-8s was immediately obvious. My confidence going up a steep wet muddy ""trail"" was much higher than with the Altras. The waterproofing was pointless as I sunk ankle deep over and over. I then put away the action cam and started using the poles. It was a real surprise to discover I loved them. I had been worried about them being awkward, heavy or even tripping me up. But they made the incline much easier.

![Trail Mid](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/YDXJ0029.JPG)

After less than a mile I headed back. The wind was incredibly strong and the fog had started to come in. Going down in these conditions is actually more difficult than going up. Despite the added traction of the 8mm lugs on the X-CLAWs, I still slipped a few times. I also took my eye off the ground for a moment and landed on my arse. The poles were a big help on the really steep bits.

I found my feet were moving around inside the X-CLAWs a lot more than I expected. But checking afterwards revealed that I hadn't cinched down the laces well at all. I'll also switch to heel-lock lacing on them as soon as they dry out.

![X-CLAW 275 Dirty](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-06-10%2013.21.35.jpg)

## Conclusion
Two big thumbs up. For Irish mud, the X-CLAWs are perfect. For general hill walking and running, the poles are a bargain. However I'm sure the pole weight would be an issue over distances like 50k. I'll report back on this from the [Chiltern Challenge 50k Ultra](http://www.xnrg.co.uk/events/details/chiltern-challenge-ultra2017.aspx) in July!

Quick Vodafone Fax tip,"Every once in a while I still need to receive a fax. I continue to be surprised by the number of people who don't know that you don't need a fax machine to do this. 

If you are on Vodafone, make sure you have set up a Vodafone email account and then just give out your mobile number preceded with a 5 as your fax number i.e. +353-87-5NNNNNNN. The fax is then sent to a special folder on Vodafone email and you get an SMS to say it is there. You can then logon and download the fax as a picture which you can print out.

If memory serves, the alternative is that you call your voicemail and it gives you the option to forward the fax to another fax machine of your choosing.

Rashers,"At what point in the 1980's/1990's did back bacon take over from streaky bacon? I assume it was all the low-fat food nazis who caused it to happen. Go to Tesco Wilton now and in an entire row of bacon, you may see one crappy pack of ""pale streaky rashers"" on special offer. Oh and pancetta of course, which is tooooooootally different.

I always look forward to bacon in US hotels when I travel because they still understand the art of the streaky rasher. Ultra thin and cooked till crisp. At the other extreme here we have these monster thick slices of bland minimal-fat back rashers which do nothing for me and are like chewing through a piece of rope.

Catherine grabbed a few packs of streaky in Martin Carey's on Saturday. Only €2.50 for a big pack. I put em in a large pan with oil on Sunday morning and cooked them slow for over half an hour. What we were left with was fabulous crunchy bacon that made the ultimate BLT. Throughout the day, as we passed the cooker, each of us would grab a rasher or two. Perfect snack food.

Recipe and Gardening advice by SMS and Web,"We're just playing around with a few ideas on a site called [Jaiku](http://conoro.jaiku.com/) this morning (they were bought by Google a few months back). The idea is that you can have discussion channels on particular topics like technology, politics, Bandon GAA, whatever. What makes it (and other great sites like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/conoro)) so powerful is that you can interact with it entirely through SMS on your phone.

So this morning I created two non-techie ones that I thought might appeal to my more foodie readers. The first is [#recipes](http://jaiku.com/channel/recipes) and the second is [#gardening](http://jaiku.com/channel/gardening). In both cases the idea was that they could be used for requesting advice (in addition to general chitchat).

The #recipes one was suggested by [Michael Kiely](http://festoon.jaiku.com/) and he thought it would be great if you were out shopping and spotted an ingredient and wanted suggestions for mini-recipes so you'd know what else to buy whilst you were there. A quick SMS, a bit more shopping and you might get some suggestions back by SMS.

I thought of the #gardening one and it could also be used in a similar way to #recipes when in a Garden Centre and wondering e.g. is X worth buying, it Y over-priced etc.

Of course you can use both channels on the web too (and obviously type a lot more than 140 characters!).

There are two flies in the ointment. The first is that it'll need more people on these channels to make them work and the second is that joining Jaiku is officially closed at the minute. Both can be solved in one fell swoop by heading over to [Jaiku Invites](http://jaikuinvites.com/), setup by [Ciarán Rooney](http://www.weeno.ie/) and requesting an invite to join.

Give it a go. It's just a bit of fun and I've already had two suggestions on how to cook the fennel bulbs I bought on a whim in Lidl during the week. Any problems using it, just pop a comment here."
Recording Streaming Audio for later listening,"I've been trying to figure out how to record streaming audio so I can listen to it later (and start/stop when I like). Actually it's specifically for [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Quandary Phase](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/). I didn't really enjoy the last radio series and the repeats of the TV series aren't that great either. But it became a technical challenge that I wanted to get to the bottom of. I finally cracked it today. Note that the solution below will not work behind some corporate firewalls but seems to work fine on my NATed setup on a Linksys Wireless Router at home.

Download MPlayer for Windows and all the codecs.

[http://www2.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/win32-beta/MPlayer-mingw32-1.0pre7.zip](http://www2.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/win32-beta/MPlayer-mingw32-1.0pre7.zip)

[http://www2.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/windows-all-20050412.zip](http://www2.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/windows-all-20050412.zip)

Unzip MPlayer and unzip the codecs.Copy the unzipped codecs to the codecs sub-dir of the mplayer dir.

Open a command prompt in the Mplayer dir and type:

mplayer -dumpfile hitchhikers.ra -dumpstream rtsp://rmv8.bbc.net.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/hitchhikers.ra

It streams in realtime so it'll take 30 mins to download.

Listen to ram file later at your leisure using realplayer (or the nifty stripped down, bloat-free [Real Alternative](http://www.codecguide.com/about_real.htm))

Do that once a week to get each new episode.

Don't try this with VLC. I spent ages trying to get it to work before I realised it doesn't support realaudio!"
Regular Service will resume soon,"I have no excuse for the lack of posting here other than the usual busy-ness of life. I'll get back into writing mode very soon. Lots of blogposts and book reviews in my head, I just need to get them out through my fingers.

Speaking of reviews, I hope my loyal readers don't mind me doing a very quick bit of blatant promotion of [LouderVoice](http://business.loudervoice.com/). We have just kicked off our 2008 BES offering. If the mayhem of the markets has you spooked, then you may find our tax-efficient offering interesting. All details over on our [corporate blog](http://blog.loudervoice.com/2008/10/23/investment-opportunities-in-loudervoice/).

So for my next post, should I do a rant on Annaghmore (greatest idea since the invention of the square wheel), a review of ""Drive On"" by LJK Setright (stunning), a review of ""Full On Irish"" by Kevin Dundon (patchy) or something on why I think British Stand-Up Comedy is dead (having seen The Secret Policeman's Ball) ?"

Repentent ex-Citroëniste,"Bless me father for I have sinned. It has been four years since my last Citroën. 

My first car was a Citroën BX which I bought off my sister for &pound;2000 in about 1992\. A complete and utter piece of crap. God I loved that car. A month after I bought it, I discovered the front sub-frame was rusted through and needed to be replaced. That cost over a grand and after that the car sat pointing towards the sky. I also replaced the carbuerettor to improve fuel economy and succeeded in getting it from 20 mpg to 21 mpg. It had some big problem with air temperature too and would choke and die after an hours driving or so. But dammit it was fabulous. Supremely comfortable, utterly ergnomic and very fast for a 1.6 due to the use of plastic for the boot and bonnet and roof. The dashboard was the old style with non-cancelling indicators and sliders and switches where others would have stalks. In a later revamp they removed it to make it more ""normal"". Fools. But eventually it had to go. Rust started winning and the fuel thirst was bankrupting me.

A generic BX:

[![bx_range2](http://static.flickr.com/33/53825882_c485be7b72_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/53825882/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Of course the ultimate would have been a DS or CX but they would definitely have left me penniless. So I went mainsteam and got a 1.1 AX. Not a bad wee motor. Again quite fast for a small engine due to the use of tin foil where others would have used actual steel. So a death trap but a perfectly fine appliance for a few years. It's fatal flaw lay in the electrics and it randomly needed a push start in the morning. Luckily our car-port was on a hill and I could usually do it myself. 

Someone else's AX:

[![ax_small](http://static.flickr.com/31/53825844_3c2734e4b6_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/53825844/ ""Photo Sharing"")

As the pay improved, I set my sights higher and got a 1.6 Xantia. This was a schizophrenic car, being both classically a Citroen with hydropneumatic suspension and nice ergnomic touches but very mainstream in styling. Unfortunately, it was way too heavy and the 1.6 was not powerful enough. But like the BX it was fabulously comfortable and great for long distance driving. It didn't really have too many flaws but was getting old and the lack of over-taking ability was a big problem.

A random Xantia:

[![xantia_crop](http://static.flickr.com/31/53825923_1d87e31352_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/53825923/ ""Photo Sharing"")

With the windfall I got in 2000 from the Integral sale, I could finally afford to buy a new car. I waited with bated breath for pictures of the Xantia replacement to appear. Expectations were high. Finally I bought my monthly copy of CAR (every month since I was 14 years old - how sad is that?) and there it was, the C5, the dog, the car designed by a blind person, the guppy on wheels, the travesty.

Avert your eyes:

[![c5_small](http://static.flickr.com/33/53825901_f852d7d387_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/53825901/ ""Photo Sharing"")

And so I bought the perfectly sensible car for a man with a wife and kid - a Ford Mondeo. Now don't get me wrong, it is a great car. Inoffensive looking, very fast, very comfortable, reliable and handles beautifully. I paid extra for the ESP and it has saved my life on more than one occasion. Without it, there would be a little cross remembering me on the way out of Clifden. I was booting it after Paul Sheehy's wedding when I lost it at 40 mph on a newly gritted road. As the rear end headed towards the rockface at the side of the road, ESP kicked in, straightened the car out and off I went. Whew. 

Any old Mondeo:

[![mondeo](http://static.flickr.com/32/53827580_ab377c7259_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/53827580/ ""Photo Sharing"")

But, but, but the local taxi driver has the same car as me. The car was designed by the same guy who did the last VW Passat. It is a total clone, down to the pattern of the material on the inside of the door. It is an appliance. It does not move me the way a car should move me. I still smile every time I see an old Citroen or a modern Alfa or something rarer like a Lotus or Porsche or Ferrari. I will never forget thumbing from Stuttgart to Munich with Pat Reidy in 1988 to catch a flight home to repeat 2nd Eng exams. We were not given a lift by a passing Porsche 959\. But the joy of seeing one in motion. Ahhhhhh. Eventually we got a lift from a hippie in a Beetle - a car the 959 can trace its genes back to.

So, the Mondeo is fine and I'll probably drive it until it falls apart. It actually no longer makes sense as it cannot take the whole family now. So it'll be replaced either with something small and commutey like a Civic (but a Type-R :-)) or something deeply obnoxious like a second-hand Range Rover.

But then I saw pictures, the like of which I thought would never come again.  [The new Citro&euml;n C6 on Autoblog](http://www.autoblog.com/entry/1234000083058747/ )

Oh my dear god, I have to have one of these. Images of De Gaulle and The Jackal floating through my head. André Citroën has stopped spinning in his grave. Citroën is back and let us all cheer. Style, real style is back baby.

The Telegraph has a review of it too: [Citro&euml;n a Grande Vitesse](http://motoring.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/main.jhtml?xml=/motoring/2005/09/17/mfcit17.xml)"
Report problems in County Cork using this,"So after a small amount of fiddling I have put together a simple system to allow people to report problems like water/gas/electricity outages and maybe car crashes and road blockages in Cork (other suggestions welcome). 

This is by the residents and for the residents of the region. 

Updates are always visible to everyone at [The Cork Problems Page](http://corkprobs.info/).

If you want to send reports then the setup will take you maybe two minutes. From then on you can report problems using a web-page, SMS or Instant Message. 

You need to sign up to a U.S. based service called [Twitter here](https://twitter.com/signup). It's very easy to do. Once you have signed-up, go to the [CorkProbs Twitter Page here](http://twitter.com/CorkProbs) and add CorkProbs as a friend (simple link on the right hand side of page). Wait until you get an email saying that CorkProbs has also added you as a friend.

From then on, if you want to report a problem or a resolution/update then you can do the following: Go to [twitter.com](http://twitter.com/) and type the problem into the wee box at the top of the screen. **Make sure that the message starts with @CorkProbs followed by a space followed by what you want to say**. Click Update.

Within a couple of minutes your message will appear on the [Cork Problems Web Page here](http://corkprobs.info/). You can check this page whenever you want to see what other updates people are posting. Techies can subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://corkprobs.info/atom.xml).

If you like that, but want more flexibility, then you can set up your Twitter account so you send the problem reports via SMS. Just go to [this settings page](http://twitter.com/devices)  and tell them about your phone. From then on, you just send SMS messages to +447624801423 in the same style as before i.e. **first bit is @CorkProbs**

Note that number is a UK one (Twitter does not have an Irish one) so it's a wee bit more expensive than sending it to an Irish number.

People on Google GTalk can also use that to send messages.

Let me know what you think or if you need any help getting set up. I hope we can create a useful resource for everyone in Cork in the absence of any notification system from Cork CoCo. 

Of course there is nothing stopping their employees from signing up and sending updates to it!"
Request for Feedback - Structured Recipes,"If you've seen the various posts I've done over the past few weeks on structured blogging and it has all been a bit beyond you, please keep reading, this won't be.

A discussion had started on the structured blogging mailing list about creating a format for structured recipes. The idea here is that all those people who publish recipes on their blogs would hopefully move to using a common format which provides structure where appropriate but still allows for each person to do things their own way. This provides benefits to both recipe writers and those of us who read and use them.

There are two reasons for this. One is that you end up with a nice simple form to fill out when typing up your recipe which will help ensure that you don't leave out anything critical. But more importantly it will enable a new breed of search tool or recipe web-site which can trawl all of the blogs out there and provide recipes to end-users which are a much closer match to what they want than typing ""chicken recipes"" on Google.

With any approach which applies structure where there was none previously, the critical success factor is finding the right balance between structured information and free-form information. Add too much structure and it inhibits you, add too little and it provides no gain.

So I am throwing this question out to everyone. It doesn't matter if you have written your own cookbook or have only ever read how to cook spaghetti from the back of the packet. What information do you think would be useful to have structured in a recipe on a blog or web-site?

To aid the thinking process, I have done some screenshots from a very nice Recipe Management Tool called [Gourmet Recipe Manager](http://grecipe-manager.sourceforge.net/). Even if you have no interest in this post, I recommend you check the tool out. The screenshots are of the windows it displays to enable you to enter a new recipe. So have a good look at those and let me know which fields you think are important to be kept ""separate"" from the main recipe description.

One way of thinking about it would be to imagine what you would search for if you were on a recipe search site. Is it ""main ingredient"" or ""overall time"" or ""ethnicity"" or ""main vs sweet"" or ""ballpark cost"" or ""skill required"". There are a ton of possibilities but the idea is to find the really critical ones and work from there.

So all you lurkers who read this blog (including the 300 who suddenly appeared from the BBC2 web-site last Thursday - and I'm still trying to figure out why), de-lurk and post your opinions. This is one of those cases where no-one is wrong and all opinions are equally valuable.

There are some techie aspects to this which I will only mention in passing. Skip this paragraph if you are not technically inclined: An XML format was developed in 2002 called [RecipeML ](http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/spec/recipeml-spec.html)to allow different software packages to swap recipes. Unfortunately, it looks like it never took off but that should not detract from the technical quality of the idea. It may form a strong basis for the under-the-hood aspects of this discussion. Having said that, Troy Hakala (one of the original authors of the format) pooh-poohed the idea of trying to do anything with recipes scattered across millions of blogs back in 2003! He does this [as a comment to a post on the OxDECAFBAD Blog](http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/11/14/the-recipe-web). it is worth reading that original post and his reply to see how much things have changed in the blog world since November 2003\. Back then, Troy effectively came up with the same idea as [Edgeio ](http://www.edgeio.com/)(but thought it made no sense).

Anyway, techies and non-techies, foodies and non-foodies, have a look at these, have a think and post a comment.

#### Best programme about food I've seen in over a year. What makes the guy from El Bulli tick?

I've been a big fan of Anthony Bourdain since I read Kitchen Confidential and my opinion of him just grew and grew with the TV shows and his Les Halles cookbook.

I was flicking around Sky the other night and spotted ""Anthony Bourdain decod...."" in the channel guide on UK TV Food. I pressed the info button and was thrilled to see that he was going to meet with Ferran Adria of El Bulli, rated best restaurant in the world for the past two years.

Adria is famous for a type of cooking which some coin ""molecular gastronomy"" and for which Heston Blumenthal in The Fat Duck is also famed. The basic idea is that you analyse what you are doing from a rigorous scientific viewpoint which enables you to come up woth new processes, tastes and textures that more traditional chefs could never do.

At the low-end you have things like ""foams"" which are already hackneyed and being done by people of far less talent in many restaurants around the world. These are whipped up foams of things like carrot so you get taste but no ""body"".

The programme started well with Bourdain saying he didn't think much of this view of cooking. It lacked heart or passion and seemed to be more concerned with shock than taste.

But he headed to Barcelona and was told first to check out a ""ham"" shop caled Jamonissimo. I was in heaven watching them thinly slice various types of Jamon Iberico like Salamanca. The fat was almost melting at room temperature. Pure food porn. The point of the exercise was to give Bourdain some idea of where Adria is coming from in terms of pure taste and pure texture.

Aside: We get small blocks of Serrano and Jamon Curado from my parents when they come back from Spain. Sibéal, aged 3, loves it and calls it Special Ham.

Bourdain then headed to the workshop to meet the team. And it was a proper team where everyone had equal say. Adria just sees himself as the front-man for the team. This was an incredible place where they spend hours every day trying ideas out, rigorously documenting them and then deciding if they could go on a menu.

A few things they showed included cooking sardines in such a way that they looked raw but were fully cooked, searing a peach so it had the texture of fois gras and trying a chemical that you can either taste as bitter or not taste at all depending on your genetic make-up!

Then it was time for the meal which was just mind-blowing. You get up to 32 courses over 5 hours in a restaurant which has 55 chefs and 55 seats. Each course is barely a mouthful or two but each one is amazing in execution. I'm only going to list a few but I was drooling at every one.

Apple Caviar: Somehow they can make tiny balls which have the shape and texture of caviar but burst to reveal a taste of pure apple.

Pasta-less Ravioli: Large globules of pure pea puree held together only by willpower.

Jamon-Tuna: Fat belly of tuna cured like jamon and sliced wafer thin. You get a tweezers to pick it up.

The amazing thing about the whole meal was that it was very relaxed, the restaurant looks pretty standard Spanish style and is not overly formal at all. I have no idea how much a meal costs and I know the waiting list is a year but some day, SOME DAY, I'm eating in El Bulli.

Oh and Bourdain was utterly convinced by the end."

Second eldest's bike kept getting ""borrowed"" by the older kids in the estate until it finally fell apart so we recently decided to get him a replacement at the same time as his older brother.

He is only 5 years old and could not handle gears so it had to be single-gear bike.

The choice in Halford's (Mahon Point, Cork) generally for kids isn't great. But he spotted an pseudo-BMX bike and had to have it. At  €109 (after €50 discount) it was only a tenner cheaper than the 18-speed ATB that his brother got. However it seems to have higher quality components and is still reasonable value.

[![Halford](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1227/726153943_4cb616a700.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/726153943/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Assembly took about forty minutes at home. The handlebars, front wheel and seat were all that really needed to be done. But the axle extensions took the most amount of time due to not having the right tool. 

All of the kids earlier bikes came with old-style crappy side-pull brakes. I now insist on V brakes and this one came with proper ones which are great stoppers. 

He loves the bike and makes sure to lock it all the time to stop the ""biggies"" taking it on him!

Highly recommended.

Review of Buddha Bar Paris,"We all know to expect snooty service in Paris but I've rarely found that and have enjoyed most meals that I've had there. So I was a bit gobsmacked by the Jean Marie Le Pen supporters running Buddha Bar in Paris.

The ""evening"" unfolded like this.

1.  We're at Le Web 3 conference in Paris and we want to get some food. We also want to do so near the NetVibes party later on Rue de Rivoli
2.  Tariq Krim says that it isn't a good area for food but Buddha Bar is ok.
3.  Four of us take the tube over, arrive into Buddha Bar and I ask if they have a table for 8 people (the expected number)
4.  Stormtrooper behind desk snaps ""have you a reservation"". No, sorry, we don't.
5.  Stormtrooper snaps ""for how many?"". We say 8.
6.  Stormtrooper snaps ""how many here now"". Emmm, only 4.
7.  Stormtrooper snaps ""well come back when there are 8"". Oh ok.
8.  We go to the Bar. Then the [beer rip-off story](http://conoroneill.com/2007/12/13/how-to-render-me-speechless/) happens.
9.  Three people cancel on us, so we are now 5 and we go back to desk
10.  Stormtrooper snaps ""yes?"". Emmm, we'd like a table for 5.
11.  Stormtrooper snaps ""have you a reservation"". We were just here 15 minutes ago.
12.  Stormtrooper snaps ""how many here now"". Emmm, 5.
13.  Stormtrooper picks up walkie-talkie and shouts into it. Someone shouts back.
14.  Stormtrooper snaps ""follow that woman"" and turns away from us
15.  Stormtrooper II shouts into Walkie talkie and points down the stairs
16.  We descend and encounter Stormtrooper III shouting into a walkie talkie
17.  She brings us to a table
18.  That's it. We never received any other service from them
19.  After 40 minutes without menus, water, bread or anyone to flag down, we walked out.
If I'd had a few drinks on me I'd probably have found it hilarious but as it was actually the worst non-dining experience of my life. You'd be better off in McDonalds.

We walked up Rue de Rivoli and found a nice pub bistro doing steak, frites and wine. A decent solid meal. I only wish I'd written the name of it down."
Review of Capote (Movie),"<div lang=""en"" class=""hreview"">

    <div class=""description"">

I used to read lots but don't find the time any more. I've always tended to avoid ""literature"". Either non-fiction or pulp thrillers are my staples. I'm one of those people who read ""Catcher In The Rye"" and thought ""so what? tosser"".

For this reason, whilst I'd obviously heard of Truman Capote and knew the basic story of In Cold Blood, I've never had any desire to read it and had no intention of watching ""Capote"" the movie. However I think Philip Seymour Hoffman is incredible and I could find nothing else to watch on Sky Movies last Saturday so I gave it a go.

I'm so glad I did. Capote was obviously a very strange man, utterly manipulative and obsessed with fame but that cannot take away from what he achieved with his novel. As he said himself, this was the book he was born to write. 

In case you don't know, quick synopsis: Capote worked for The New Yorker magazine. In 1959 he spotted a story about the murder of an entire family of farmers in Kansas and decides to go there to cover it. He befriends many of the people involved and decides there is a book in it. They catch the perpetrators and he starts interviewing them, focusing on the more ""sensitive"" one. His empathy with them is quite disturbing. He released ""In Cold Blood"" to worldwide acclaim becoming America's most famous author and never finished another book.    

I don't know if he invented a new genre or not but I realised watching the movie that he was writing the sort of book that would appeal to me. More than straight non-fiction and more important than fiction.

As the movie progressed, I was worried that we would never hear about the night of the murders from the killers (as was Capote) but eventually we did and it felt authentic. At least one of them deserved the death penalty and they both got it which finally enabled Capote to publish. Of course the implication is that he wanted the execution to happen or he would never have a complete book.

The acting throughout is superb and I was disappointed that Catherine Keener didn't get more screen time and that her character of Harper Lee who wrote ""To Kill a Mockingbird?"" was not explored more. His partner remained oddly anonymous throughout too.

Apart from that, a superb film for which Hoffman fully deserved the Oscar.

    <div class=""description"">

Initially everyone hated the idea of Daniel Craig doing Bond. Then the movie came out and they all ate crow. We finally saw it on DVD over the weekend and it was worth the wait.

It's back to the cold, harsh, darkly witty Bond of old with so much of the baggage of thirty years discarded. The only real gadget was a portable defibrillator to restart his heart. The vodka martini line was turned on its head and many of the stunts/action sequences were not ridiculous.

Craig acts well but I don't like the permanent pout. However the dangerous edge he adds is just perfect. As ever the Bond girls were disposable but easy on the eye.

The fight scene on the cranes was the most over-the-top bit but was brilliantly executed and I'd watch it again. There was finally some subtlety in the baddies/goodies with the wild card of the African guys being a nice touch.

Probably the best action/spy movie I've seen in the past few years.

Review of Clonakilty Model Railway Village,"I love finding something great almost on your doorstep that you've ignored for years. We finally took a trip to the Model Railway village last weekend and it was a resounding success. Kids, young and old will have some fun here.

I've lost track of the number of times I've said we must pop in for a look. The closest we got was some of the kids taking the road-train around Clon with their Granny last year. I decided to be brave and take all 5 with me to check it out properly.

It's just on the edge of town past the GAA pitch on the way to Inchydoney.  Lots of space in the car park which also acts as the start/end of the road-train. You are greeted by some lovely old carriages now doing duty as shop and cafe.

[![Clonakilty Model Railway Village - Share on Ovi](http://media.twango.com/m1/medium/0172/58f34cf4bc7b4891a9a19addba3c1360.jpg ""Clonakilty Model Railway Village - Share on Ovi"")](http://www.twango.com/media/conor.public/conor.10114)

For the life of me I can't remember how much it was in, but it wasn't a hell of a lot. Baby got in for free. Our first stop was the indoor play area. Whilst very small (fitting into one single storey room), it's ideal for wet days and all of ours had some fun there for 30 minutes or so. My only criticism is that with two doors, it's too easy for a kid to sneak out. Maybe sliding bolts on half doors would make things a little bit more difficult for them.

[![Clonakilty Model Railway Village - Share on Ovi](http://media.twango.com/m1/medium/0172/82b1df9ea4404e8db78d1f02ce329edc.jpg ""Clonakilty Model Railway Village - Share on Ovi"")](http://www.twango.com/media/conor.public/conor.10112)

We then headed outside and I was genuinely surprised by what I found. Lots of scale models of towns and train stations of the past in Cork. Bandon got pride of place and all were connected together by a long meandering electric model railway.

[![Clonakilty Model Railway Village - Share on Ovi](http://media.twango.com/m1/medium/0172/921c15608ab248549b47125e3d2dec06.jpg ""Clonakilty Model Railway Village - Share on Ovi"")](http://www.twango.com/media/conor.public/conor.10117)

Each child found something different to occupy them. The 2 year old just ran around after the model trains. The baby checked out the models and the three eldest ran around, hiding, looking, and climbing.

The detailing on the model towns really is fantastic and it was a pleasure to see how The Shambles might have looked in the old days.

We finished off with a walk through the cafe and shop carriages and headed home happy after a good 1.5 hours of fun. All of the staff were extremely friendly and the whole place has a lovely feel to it. If you are in the area or just passing through, it's a nice old fashioned relaxing way to hang out with your kids."
Review of Comic Relief does The Apprentice,"<div lang=""en"" class=""hreview"">

Whoever is running Comic Relief this year is doing a wonderful job with all the pre-programmes. Despite myself I'm enjoying Fame Academy but it pales in comparison to the TV gold that was The Apprentice tonight.

They gathered together a bunch of celebrities to raise funds for Comic Relief via a fun-fair in London.

On the bloke's side we had Alastair Campbell, Piers Morgan, Danny Baker, Grant from Eastenders and Rupert Evert. The vicious banter started immediately with Sir Alan. Jibes about selling peerages on street corners were particularly good.

On the birds side we had Cheryl Tweedy-Cole, Maureen Lipman, Trinny, Karen Brady and Jo Brand. Sir Alan had a few digs at Karen who is MD of Birmingham City FC.

I guessed the two strong characters for the men would be Campbell and Morgan and that turned out to be true. Poor Grant was invisible for most of the show and Danny got a few looks in. The pathetic Rupert got all precious on everyone and the poor lamb decided he couldn't handle the camera on him the whole time. This is after the guys came up with the awesome idea of him auctioning phone calls to his Hollywood buddies for charity. Or as Piers put it ""ask Madonna to stop buying babies for a minute and chip in"". So the big girls blouse exited to be replaced by Tim from Apprentice 1.

On the womens side, I was surprised to see both Jo and Maureen disappear into the woodwork. Karen ran the show but Trinny and Cheryl were the front-women. Some of their fund-raising was phenomenal - who was the plastic-surgery-distorted woman who gave them 150k?

Most of the men's ""big ideas"" fell flat but I loved the fact that Alastair and Piers admitted that they were big-picture guys and usually had a swarm of PAs to take care of the implementation. I was impressed with Piers' failed idea of getting the 20 twenty bonus-earners in an investment bank to give 50k each and all arrive on a bus.

TV highlight of 2007 occurred after Trinny did a mini-workout with Cheryl to re-energise her. (On a slight side-note, am I the only bloke out there who thinks that Cheryl is a fabulous looking woman despite the shockin accent?) Anyway, they sit back down and have their heads down doing the numbers. Cheryl asks ""where did you learn to do that?"". Trinny replies ""I learned it from a Russian doctor I stay with in Austria who de-toxes me""....Pause....Cheryl raises her head and looks at the camera. Then lowers it a second later. I collapsed in laughter.

Later she asks Trinny if she suffers from ""that OCD"". I think I love this woman.

The fun-fair seemed to go well. I particularly liked Tracy Emin's coconuts for the coconut-shy painted as breasts.

Overall it looked like the men had out-executed on the day but then the numbers were totted at the end. The guys made over 200k, the women made over 600k! Wow.

More tomorrow night during Comic Relief. I'll be glued.

Review of Guerrilla Gourmet (Ep 02),"After the first travesty of an episode I swore I'd never watch another but the lure of Denis Cotter in Bandon was too much. This is Gimmicky Garbage TV with a half decent programme buried somewhere far far underneath.

In the first episode they send Kevin Dundon to cook a gourmet meal in a boxing club in poor area of Waterford. If you thought that was crass, in this one Denis Cotter set up a vegetarian restaurant in the middle of cattle pens in Bandon Mart!

What drives me insane about the programme is that Denis is interesting, his food is interesting, his walkabout with a botanist eating wild greens was interesting (albeit very Hugh FW) and getting average people to try vegetarian food is interesting. Setting it in a cattle mart is retarded. Whatever ""right-on"" TV exec came up with this whiz-bang idea should have a pile of cow scutter dumped on his desk because that's what this whole series is.

Take all those great chefs, get them to cook from the heart, find out what motivates them, explain their influences and where they trained and you could have a legendary TV series instead of this steaming pile of crap.

Next week Kevin Thornton cooks pork in a Mosque. Or something."

    <span><span class=""stars"" title=""5"">![](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/5outof5.gif)</span></span>

    <span class=""description"">

I'll be honest, I think Heston is fantastic. I love what he does and how he does it. He tickles my engineering brain cells and my foodie ones at the same time. The location of the Fat Duck was the only reason we didn't eat there for our ten year anniversary.

This series, like the first, has him trying to create the ultimate ""X"" each week. This week it was chicken tikka masala. He strangely went to India to start with when most people agree it was invented in the UK. He found two places doing something similar (particularly butter chicken) but neither was very close.

The spices catching on the back of his throat as he wandered around the market was interesting. I've had that effect when using chilli powder, not fun. 

The key to great indian cooking appears to be the clay tandoors which reach temperatures nearing 400C instead of the usual kitchen ovens which max at 250C. What did he do? He built one in the car park of the restaurant in the ground! I swear I was tempted to try it too. His version for home cooks was a stack of bricks in a kettle BBQ surrounded by hot coals.    

His overall approach with the dish was not that crazy, just more precise that any of us would do. He had marinades analysed by MRI to see how deep they penetrate the meat. It turns out that the yoghurt is critical in getting the flavour deep into the chicken. I'm guessing it's the acid?

Unfortunately as the dish progressed I thought it went further and further away from my idea of a tikka masala. In particular the use of coconut milk really seemed wrong. For me a great version is saucy but absolutely not like eating cloying sweet cream of tomato soup. His final result looked far too rich and overwhelming and he just kept adding bits. 

I'll never attempt to cook anything he does but I'll revel in watching the geek's ultimate chef every week.

    <div class=""description"">

House MD is one of those TV series I should hate. It stars Hugh Laurie with a put-on American accent as Gregory House, head of diagnostics at a Princeton hospital. 

It has exactly the same plot every week. Person comes in with confusing symptoms, starts heading towards death, team keeps trying to figure out what is wrong, use wrong treatment, make patient worse, finally just in the nick if time, they figure it out and patient is saved. There is always one rule:

 [![House MD](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1315/965154116_b75f12baa2_o.png)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/965154116/ ""Photo Sharing"")

But it's compelling viewing and is built around the fact that House is a complete misanthrope. He hates everyone equally but does it with such witty invective that you love him.

He suffers terrible pain from a serious surgery on his leg and is addicted to Vocidon (yes, I spelled wrong to stop spammers). This led to a great series of episodes where he made the mistake of pissing off a cop who then tried to do him for a variety of crimes to punish him for taking excess painkillers on the job.

The episode we watched last night had him in a wheelchair for a week as a bet so that he could get his old parking space back which had been given to a real wheelchair user. His argument was that he suffered more walking further with a cane than she did in a motorised wheelchair. 

As we are very bold people and may (or may not) have got our hands on bittorrented copies of all three series, we generally watch a couple at a time.

Fabulous TV!

Review of Hugh's Chicken Run,"This is less of a review and more of a vote of support. Last week Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall kicked off a campaign to get people eating Free Range Chicken. He did this through a series of compelling programmes comparing intensively raised chicken production with Free Range.

Because no-one would let him film in a ""normal"" chicken production unit, he was forced to build his own. He split it down the middle with half as free range and half as intensive. Watching the differences become more and more apparent as the birds grew was a real eye-opener for me. Whilst we mainly buy free range, I had started to become dubious about the differences when I saw the same producer names on both types. But after watching this, I'm a total convert.

Quite simply, the methods used to intensively rear chicken are disgusting. If you want to eat meat that has been sitting in its own shit for its entire 39 day life, go right ahead but apart from any issues of animal welfare, if you want to see where Bird Flu will make the leap to humans in Europe, that's where it'll be.

Hugh's campaign to get shops and restaurants in Axminster using free range were reasonably successful even in Tesco and the local kebab shop. His efforts with a local working-class community  to rear their own birds, whilst laudable, teetered on the brink of condescending. However the emotional scenes during slaughter did drive home the reality of where your meat comes from.

I'd love to know how many people who eat frankenstein chicken also support a ban on fois gras. I know which one I have a much bigger problem with.

I did think the focus on whole birds was mis-directed. Most people only eat a full bird once a week. My feeling is that the bulk of chicken sold is skinless chicken breasts and ready-meals. This obsession with breast meat should be tackled too since it addresses the issue of cost head on. We have 1KG of free range drumsticks sitting in the fridge. They cost €4.99 and will give us a fabulous meal when we roast them up in the oven with some spicy coatings.

One thing that interests me hugely is the numbers angle for a company like Tesco. Looking at it as a simple punter, surely pushing higher margin products like free-range benefits the bottom line? Whilst in the 70's and 80's when everyone was broke, price wars on a loaf of bread could cause people to change supermarket, is that really the case nowadays? I find it bizarre that somewhere like Tesco Wilton will be jammed with ""Value"" chicken plus a few exorbitant organic ones whilst being out of stock of free range constantly. Increasing demand for free-range will increase supply and drive down cost and hopefully make the Frankenstein Chicken just a short term historical aberration.

I was a bit shocked to see the Tesco manger in Hugh's programme using a green-screen VDU. I assumed all their real-time analytics would be in multiple large screen dashboards showing exactly what was happening where in the shop. Maybe that's why Wilton rarely has free range?

There is surely a huge PR coup to be had by the first supermarket which goes 100% free range on chicken and eggs whilst using the ""animal welfare and customer health"" advertising angle?

If you can catch the repeats of this, please do. If not, at the very least sign up for the [Chicken Out campaign](http://www.chickenout.tv) and if you have a blog, add the badge to it like I have done."
Review of Inov-8 TrailFly Ultra G 300 Max,"After the heel-destroying catastrophe of the [Saucony Peregrine 10](/2021/06/07/review-of-saucony-peregrine-10-11/) and my bad fall in the [Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX](/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/), I needed a new pair of trail running shoes that could handle both long distance and typical slippy, mucky, wet Irish terrain.

The hype around the [Inov-8 TrailFly Ultra G 300 Max](https://www.inov-8.com/eu/trailfly-ultra-g-300-max-mens-ultra-running-shoes) has almost been as big as its crazy long name. But the reviews were very good and I still love and use my old Inov-8 X-CLAW 275 on the shorter boggier stuff. The only thing that slowed me down from clicking the buy button was the price. I think €195 is going to be a sticking point (pun fully intended) for a lot of people when other bigger brands are a lot cheaper.

But I really wanted to try something other than Hoka for long distance off-road. Whilst I loved my Evo Mafates, they crushed my little toes and they separated at the join between the upper and the midsole. Like all Hokas ever. And every review of the Speedgoats talks about how narrow they are, so I've avoided them for years now.

Of course the nerd in me wanted to see if the graphene hype was justified. So I eventually talked myself into buying them (LOL, like I wasn't always going to relent). 

![Clean](/images/2021/06/inov-8-trailfly-ultra-g-300-max-clean.jpg)

Sidebar: Inov-8 please fix your website for non-UK customers. Those multiple location/currency popups are infuriating and it means that deep links to your site never work for international users. Ultra Damos FKT story was basically unfindable from outside the UK.  

Sidebar 2: Oh hey Hoka, exactly same problem with your EU site and links. Lads, this stuff isn't hard, sort it out.

Back to the review.

First impression was ""oh my god what's that abominable smell?"". It's like every nasty semi-industrial thing you bought from a no-name vendor on Aliexpress packed into one box. Whilst it didn't fill my office as badly as Ginger Runner's, there's still a definite niff, even after a few runs. But that's not important. (And a low-temp wash with some Vanish sorted it out)

The upper is a little stiff but works well and seems to size big (I had the same issue on the X-Claw). I suspect the UK-US-EU sizing is different depending on what country unit the manufacturer uses internally. So an Inov-8 44 is much bigger than a Hoka or Nike 44. If you use EU sizing, maybe go down a half or 1. But I could get good lockdown with the laces and had no issue with my foot sliding around.

The cushioning on my first 5 mile run in [Castlefreke](https://www.strava.com/activities/5376075616) in West Cork, Ireland, was excellent and the midsole was nice and flexible. It seems Inov-8 can do max cushion well!

The lugs are fairly shallow but wide so I wondered what their preferred surface would be. Grip was superb on grit, grass and mud. But a static test on a wet slab showed it wasn't grippy at all on that surface. Which was a disappointment for me, since that was one of the drivers for buying them. 

I followed that with a 3 mile run on [The Seven Heads](https://www.strava.com/activities/5415408198), also in West Cork, which consisted of a dirt track, grass and road. The grass section is a great test as the fields are very sloped and the grass was wet. I've slid badly there in several other brands and the lock-down on a old pair of Altra Lone Peaks was so awful my entire foot twisted out of the shoe and it came off. I had none of those issues with the TUG 300M which was a great result.

Finally I did an 11 mile hike yesterday on the [Sheep's Head Way](https://www.strava.com/activities/5425613675) (yes, in West Cork, Ireland) on a lot of very challenging surfaces. Tons of bog, mud, rocks, heather and steep up/down on hills. And it chewed it all up. I didn't slip once and I was completely comfortable the entire way around. Which is very cool, considering my 60 miler three weeks previously and my ongoing IT Band issue. I didn't test wet rocks too aggressively due to nervousness over the recent fall but the testing I did showed no problems. Oh and my toes were not crushed!

The only problem I had was my feet getting soaked from the get-go. And that's where I think Inov-8 can meet the market half-way on price. A Gore-Tex/GTX version of the TUG 300M would be a killer shoe. Since it's not designed for fell-running or the really gnarly stuff, they should do everything they can to make it the ultimate long-distance multi-terrain off-road shoe. And Gore-Tex adds a massive degree of extra comfort for that use-case. Do that at €195 and the complaints about price would drop hugely. As it is, despite being a great shoe which is now instantly my main MUT go-to, that price point is problematic.

In summary, it's a fantastic long-distance trail running shoe that might not quite live up to the Graphene hype but easily competes with the big boys and hopefully will give hundreds of miles of use.

**UPDATE:** I'm afraid my update after two longer (10 mile and 13 mile) runs is much less positive. In both cases the runs were on quite rough terrain with lots of mud, bog, rocks and steep ups and downs. These were on The Beara Way and The Kerry Way. On the first one, my feet were sliding around badly inside the shoe. But tightening the laces enough resulted in me having horrendous pains on the top of my feet after a few miles. The Trailflys also proved lethal on wet slabs. Absolutely zero grip. I basically skated across the slabs. On the second run, the problem was blisters. In over ten years of running, with lots of off-road, I have never got a blister behind my little toe. Plenty on the toe itself, sure, but never behind. It felt like there was something rough on the inside of the shoe rubbing the side of my foot but I found nothing afterwards. I suspect it's down to the upper material which is too stiff. Finally, once they get wet, they weigh an absolute ton. So overall I'm afraid these are not suitable for traditional Inov-8 terrain and seem to be much more suited to long distances on easy groomed dry trails.

    <div class=""description"">

My birthday meal out this year was to Jacques in Cork City. I've heard lots of complimentary things about it over the years and both my sister and parents have had great meals there.It's a little awkward to find being on a side-street of a side-street and it turned out to be much smaller than I expected and jammed full. 

The room isn't great. Very bright with spotlights on the ceiling and old pictures of the city on the walls. We both thought it lacked character and didn't feel the place for a romantic quiet meal for two.

I loved the look of the menu and had a hard time deciding what to get. For starters I had lambs tongue which was quite tasty but nothing to go crazy about.

![ ](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/192/499399703_256392f97c_m.jpg)

Catherine plumped for Asparagus and Gubbeen Salami which looked great and she really enjoyed.

![ ](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/499351814_be98691a7b_m.jpg)

Wine for the night was a decent 2005 Pouilly Fumee.

![ ](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/227/499399529_536ad97987_m.jpg) 

Mains were the big let down of the night. Catherine did better with some hake on greens. Nothing wrong with it, just utterly forgettable.

![ ](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/219/499400139_7ebdd2c02e_m.jpg)

Mine was a bit of a disaster. I went with scallops on cauliflour puree. The scallops were ok if a bit insipid (frozen perhaps?) and the puree was good. But they burnt the potatoes in the stack and it ruined the plate. I know mistakes happen but when you burn something, you know you've burnt it, yet they still put it on a plate and served it to me.

![ ](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/220/499351386_4092684a72_m.jpg)

I should have given it back and complained but I couldn't be bothered. At that point we were both just disappointed with the whole experience.

Catherine wasn't grabbed by any of the deserts and I went with dates on orange. Not too bad but a bit middle-of-the-road.

![ ](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/218/499400523_4c9e513db7_m.jpg)

In fact I think that phrase defines the whole meal. Nothing massively wrong, just nothing to blow your socks off.

However, value was excellent, coming in cheaper than most meals we've eaten out in the past year. 
Maybe we just got them on a bad night since I've only heard positive things about them but to be honest I doubt we'll be back.</div>

    <div class=""summary"">Interesting product from Dunnes Stores. Decent meat and an unusual cut from an Irish Supermarket</div> 

<div><span class=""stars"" title=""4"">![](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/4outof5.gif)</span></div>

    <div class=""description"">

Catherine spotted these Kettyle products in Dunnes the other day and bought the rib-eye. Unlike most steak sold in Irish Supermarkets, this one is totally vacpacked.

I've read Hugh F-W complain about supermarket vacuum packs as they are usually full of blood too so that the meat does not dry mature properly. I found it interesting that this was entirely a dry vac-packing. 

It comes in a very nice disply package with tons of info about the long ageing process (but not how long!) and how to cook it. The company itself is based in Fermanagh.

The meat looked fantastic, dark ruby not ""still with a pulse"" like most Dunnes meat of previous years. It was riddling with marbling and was a perfect size for one.

I cooked it pretty rare and it was lovely. Dryer than I expected given the marbling but very tasty. A huge step beyond standard Dunnes stuff. 

I'm just thrilled that Dunnes are trying something a bit different from the usual sirloin/fillet that you get in every supermarket in the country. Very few people (including myself) have any clue about cuts of meat any more. Do all the great cuts that we ignore just go into mince now? I find a good rump steak to be far preferable to the ubiquitous sirloin.  

Keep an eye (pun intended) out for this great product. The one I had was €5.33 for a decent cut of meat.

    <span class=""description"">

This was our final dinner in London and I had very high hopes. I've been a fan of Giorgio Locatelli since the wonderful Tony and Giorgio TV series in 2002\. He came across as a great cook with a sparkling sense of humour.

It's just at the back of Marble Arch tube station and is in an ""Italian restaurant looking"" building. The door staff were friendly enough and the counter was piled high with his new book. We were shown to a table with only one couple near us. Unfortunately they were the stereotypical loud Yanks who must have spent 20 minutes discussing wine with the sommelier so we could all tell how much they knew.

Our waitress come over and greeted us with a with a characterless ""buona sera, good evening"", handed over menus and told us the specials in a style more suited to someone reading death notices. She also mentioned a special cocktail of the evening involving strawberries which we both went for and enjoyed.

One expects a bit of friendliness and chat in an Italian restaurant not robots repeating learned lines and clearly not giving a crap what you think of anything. But that is what we got for the entire meal. It was like the place had been taken over by the Red Army Faction. Had Giorgio just cut their wages? The grumpiness and curtness got to the level of being funny. ""You finished with the breadsticks?"" ""You finished with the bread?"".

The wine list was extensive and completely beyond me but I had taken a dislike to the sommelier too having listened to him at other tables. So I picked one of the few things I recognised, a pinot grigio, and went with that. Actually I think a normal waiter asked for our selection, we must not have deserved a sommelier. The wine started slightly harsh but got much better over the meal. 

They then proceeded to fill our glasses every five minutes with approximately 3 millilitres of wine. The glasses spent 90% of the time empty. I finally gave up towards the end and said ""you may as well keep going"" which caused a pained smile to appear on his face.

The food? Good but not incredible by any means. Catherine had some salad to start but a week later she has forgotten the details. I had a very tasty dressed cress salad with sweet onions and some fantastic salami which they described it as cured neck of pork on the menu.

We both decided to skip the meat course as nothing grabbed us at all and we went with pasta as mains. We also both picked specials - this is something I do more and more now. I work on the assumption that it is their freshest stuff and they will try to impress with it.  

Mine was a ravioli of oxtail in a tomato based sauce. It was excellent. Deep flavours and lovely textures but about half the size it should be for a main.

Catherine had a red mullet based pasta dish with tomato sauce. We both assumed the fish would sit on the pasta but it had been broken down into tiny pieces and mixed in . Whilst it was tasty enough, it could really have been any fish and disn't impress as much as mine.

I went with the special desert which was a fig based tartlet. Good but not particularly memorable. Catherine had the usual chocolatey thing which was ok but again didn't stick in the mind.

Two quick coffees and we were done. Barely 1.5 hours. The bill arrived and we were out the door without one person asking us if we had enjoyed the meal.

I had heard that this was one of the top three Italians in London, if not the best. I had also read somewhere that they were after a Michelin star. Based on our experience they haven't a hope, I've had friendlier and more genuine service in a McDonalds.

    <span class=""description"">

Recently Anthony Creswell of Ummera mentioned a maze down near Kilbrittain [in the comments](http://conoroneill.com/2007/08/15/worst-growing-season-evah/#comment-88356) of my blog. We had some visitors down from Dublin over the weekend and decided to give it a go on Saturday. I couldn't find the address of Rathclaren on the map but we headed towards Kilbrittain in any case. Luckily they have the maze well sign-posted from the village onwards.

We pulled up outside the house and rang the bell. A very friendly young boy came out and explained the whole thing and provided maps, a guide and pens. He also followed us up to get us started. 

You can do the maze to varying degrees of difficulty. Easiest is just to follow the map, get to the middle, ring the bell and get out again. If you are up for something longer then they have clues scattered all over the maze which you collect, match to letters and then solve the anagram. This means you have to investigate every nook, cranny and dead-end. Finally you can try doing it map-less!

They tell you to bring your mobile in case you get lost and this is a good idea. The field is 5 acres in size and you could easily get disoriented. Of course 8 years in the Scouts as an expert map reader meant that I survived to tell the tale.

It is €5 per person with under fives free and they also have some picnic tables if you want to eat. The Pink Elephant and some beaches are close by, so you could really make a day of it.

We had three adults, a baby in sling, my five year old and my three year old. Initially the kids were unimpressed and griped but they soon got into the swing of it when we found the first clue. They loved ringing the big brass bell in the middle. We took the easiest shortest approach which was lucky as it started raining just towards the end. I could see it being a real challenge without a map as the corn is very tall at this stage so you have no frame of reference.

It was great fun and I could see it being brilliant for parties with older kids. You could even hide surprises and prizes in the maze and have a big feast once they are done.

Great fun, good for you and a really smart dual-use facility. Highly recommended.

    <span><span class=""stars"" title=""2"">![](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/2outof5.gif)</span></span>

    <span class=""description"">

I decided last Christmas that I was never again watching or buying anything that Nigella Lawson did after her horrendous TV series. The fake family scenes recorded during the summer were just ridiculous.

But I'm a sucker for punishment and just finished watching an episode of her new series which is all about cooking quickly, a theme which has been done a thousand times. Oh how I wish I'd watched the rest of ""Crisis At Jimmy's Farm"" instead. 

There is just one word to describe this series - ""fake"". From the getting out of bed to the frankly objectionable scenes with her poor children, nothing about it is real.

Whoever advises her, whoever produced this and whoever directed it need to find new careers because this rubbish is one step below Big Brother. 

As someone who is currently grossly overweight I will also happily comment on her weight. A huge part of her popularity has been the come-hither nonsense and hair flicking. I'm sorry but that just doesn't work any more when you are heading into Demis Roussos Kaftan territory.

But what about the food? A mix of good and bad. I object to any show which is about cooking and uses Thai curry pastes. What is the difference between using them and saying ""empty a jar of Dolmio Bolognese sauce over the mince""? 

The steak and white bean mash was a variation on an Avoca recipe we use all the time. The Avoca one is nicer but I'd still recommend what Nigella did. 

I liked the idea of the chickpeas and rocket with chorizo and scallops as it includes a lot of things I like but when it was dished up it looked terribly dry. [Caroline Bibliocook's](http://www.bibliocook.com/archives/2005/11/chickpea_and_ch.html) chickpea, spinach, tomato and chorizo dish is far superior and we use it all the time. Caroline's dish is also great for feeding veggies as you just cook off the chorizo separately.

Dreadful dreadful TV but with the possibility of an acceptable spin-off book where the food can sing and the claptrap is minimised.

    <span class=""description"">

Of all our anniversary meals in London last week, this was the one where I wasn't sure what to expect. Would it be overly formal and stuffy? Would it be filled with Gordon Gekko types and Russian tycoons?

The restaurant is in The Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge not far from Harrods. This is one of those high-end hotels where you even wait to be seated in the bar. We had a quick tipple and then wandered into Petrus itself at 6pm. It is behind an unassuming door at the end of the hotel lounge area.

The greeting staff were very friendly and gave us a seat mid-room beside the wall looking out over everything. We were first to arrive which initially caused us to be slightly tense but we needn't have worried, we were in the hands of the most professional waiting staff I have ever encountered in my life.

We didn't even look at the main menu and decided immediately to go with the ten course tasting menu. The charming sommelier came over with a selection of champagnes and the wine list which was less ""list"" and more ""novel"". We both had a glass of the Rose champagne which was gorgeous and a bit different from the usual (yes we drink champagne every day, cough). 

I was wayyyyy out of my league with the wine. They started around £40 and went to over £4000\. I just chanced my arm and picked a £55 bottle of Crozes Hermitage Graillot. The tone for the evening was set when I asked the sommelier if he thought it would work ok with the tasting menu. He could easily have been snooty about our cheap bottle but said ""spicy, fruity, an excellent winemaker, good choice"". What a star.

The Maitre d' then popped over and was wonderfully lighthearted. We had pre-warned that it was our anniversary so he claimed that the restaurant was empty since they had decided to close it for the night just for us. 

I know I'm going to get some of the dishes slightly wrong here so bear with me. We started with an amuse bouch of hummous + crisps and triangles of sweet crunchy coated fois gras (yeah yeah PETAphiles, go talk crazy to the McNugget chicken farmers, we know the story). Fois gras was great but the hummous was the best I've ever tasted. If I could make it that creamy and light, I'd eat it every day.

We then got a tall shot glass of frothy mushroomy soup which hit the spot. Next up was more fois gras with fig compote, spiced pears and almond puree. The sommelier offered us a glass of sweet wine to go with it. Normally I hate that but I was blown away by how absolutely perfectly it melded with the food in my mouth.

The scallop with braised onions and bacon was one of the most perfect portions I have ever eaten. Dear god he made the foam taste of bacon, the man is a legend. I can still taste it in my head. 

Roasted partridge, sweetcorn, cobnuts and tarragon jus was another piece of food joy. Who knew sweetcorn could taste so nice?

Turbot with baby gem, capers and raisin puree was one of those course where you'd lick the plate if you were at home. It's only recently I've realised how gorgeous cooked lettuce can be.

Roast saddle of venison prune puree and pommes boulangere suited me beautifully but was overly rare for Catherine. I'm not a fan of the treacley intense sauces that are often put with game. With this (and several other dishes) the waiters came with a little sauce boat to add some jus to the plate. This one was much more delicate than I expected and better for it.

At this point we were starting to get a touch full. The room had also filled up and I revelled in watching an efficent machine in action. These guys were awesome, constantly moving, serving, checking and doing it quietly without fuss. If you want to know why some places get Michelin stars and others don't, just come here and look. I just checked and realised they have two stars, not one. They deserve them. I've eaten in two other Michelin starred places - The Commons and Patrick Gilbauds. Neither comes close in either food or non-obsequious service. 

I loved watching the sommelier decant wine for the table beside us. The was the full works with candle and side-table and pre-tasting by him to make sure it was ok. I'm guessing that bottle cost a smidge more than £55.

At no point during the meal did we overhear any other conversations despite being reasonably close to other diners. The mix of people was refreshing too. No obvious footballers, football club owners, mobsters or movie stars. Just average looking people there for the food not the scene. 

We had two desserts, one of which still has me thinking. It was a vertical cylinder of ultra-thin white chocolate filled with a fantastic creamy filling. How the hell did they make the cylinder? Both desserts were awesome and I loved the plum sorbet.

We decided to skip coffees and nibbled on petit fours whilst waiting for the bill. Once paid, the Maitre d' popped over again to make sure we enjoyed the meal. We were more than effusive in our praise. 

Then he dropped the bombshell ""Chef Marcus Wareing is here tonight, would you like a tour of the kichen?"". Would we? Would we? I nearly ran!

Marcus (as best buddies I can now call him that) was on the hot plate in a tiny kitchen. I was shocked at how small it was. No noise, no histrionics, just another efficient people-machine. There was a chef's table facing him and they appeared to be having a great time. We were introduced and he wished us happy anniversary. I'd happily have dropped dead from clogged arteries there and then.

We were shown around all the other stations (the opposite of stations of the cross) and saw some incredibly fine detail work happening. The guy on caviar must have the steadiest hands on the planet. For the first time ever I realised that they have different heat in different parts of the kitchen. A cold gale blew from the pastry area. 

Both of us lost the ability to speak intelligently and just stared and nodded and said thank you over and over.

We left with the biggest smiles you have ever seen on two people's faces.

I doubt we'll ever top that night.

Still smiling.

Review of Saucony Peregrine 10 / 11,"This won't be a long review. Whilst I was enjoying running in the Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX, I knew the grip wasn't great on the rougher stuff. After googling around a bit, the [Saucony Peregrine](https://www.saucony.com/en/peregrine-10/43084M.html) had lots of solid reviews as a reliable decent everyday trail running shoe. Version 10 was on discount due to the recent release of version 11, so I grabbed a pair from [Alltricks](https://www.alltricks.com/F-11912-chaussures-running/P-1506839-saucony_peregrine_10_mutant_orange_men?utm_source=alltricks&utm_medium=emailing-auto&bvdata=IT_7_EN_alltricks_order_confirmation) in France.

![Peregrine 10](/images/2021/06/peregrine10.jpg)


My initial impressions were quite favourable. Despite being relatively heavy, I didn't notice the weight. And also despite some negative reviews about the grip, I found it superb on mucky and wet boggy ground. They were also totally fine when running on roads and lanes approaching trails. I went up half as size from my usual, as recommended by various reviews, and that seems to have been good advice since they fit me well.

But but but, oh my god the heel pain. It started on the first run and I assumed it was just a glitch. Then I tried a section of the very hilly [Beara Way](https://www.strava.com/activities/5188546588) towards Adrigole and I had to turn around after only 4 miles, the pain was so bad. Finally, I did a very rough 11 mile loop [around Gougane Barra](https://www.strava.com/activities/5222600669) and the pain was even more vicious. The uphills in particular were horrendous.

I assume this is what the other reviews refer to as the ""narrow heel"" but I've honestly never encountered anything like this and I have bought a *lot* of running shoes over the years.

I had to completely stop using them but the after-effects are still with me over a month later. I did the [Sheep's Head Way 60 miler](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/) in my Hokas and had the pain on-and-off in the same spot throughout. When I got home I realised I had a pinball sized bulge on the back of my heel that took several days to subside. I assume my body surrounded the point of aggravation with fluid. All of this was due to whatever issue the Peregrines had caused. An 11 mile hike yesterday in my new Inov-8 TrailFly Ultra G 300 Max (review coming next) had some residual pain too. But it wasn't terrible so hopefully I'm on the mend.

The reviews of the Peregrine 11 say that nothing much has changed in the design, so my warnings apply to them too. In fact, I found another review referring to heel pain. 

I don't know what is causing the problem but it's bizarre that the company who gave me my favourite running shoe in ten years (the Endorphin Speed), could get something so basic so wrong.

Honestly, just avoid them."

On our yokel trip to London recently we spent an afternoon in the Science Museum. One Elec Engineer and one Mech Engineer had an incredible day bouncing from exhibit to exhibit. 

There are too many things to describe but a few of the highlights for me were.

The entire Space exploration area:

The Spitfire exhibition:

Disappointments? They had nothing on computing since the 1970's. I'd love to see a display going from the Altair through the TRS-80, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Apple II, IBM PC up to a modern ultralight laptop. Ditto one on mobiles from the original analogue bricks right up to the Nokia N95 and Apple iPhone. 

It was of course filled with school kids who had clearly been brought by non-science teachers ""count how many stars are in the flag there, children"" as opposed to ""think about landing on the moon in this, children"".

There is a big gadget shop at the entrance which we found hard to leave at the end. A lot of the stuff was gimmicky but there was plenty of genuinely interesting ""sciencey"" things.

You owe it to yourself and your kids to go here and have a blast but enjoy yourself too. We are where we are today because of the things on display there.

UPDATE; I think [this explains](http://www.tnmoc.org/index.htm) the lack of computers.

This review originally conceived November 1982:

My Dad contacted a workmate of his in the UK to see if they could get me one of the new ZX Spectrum home computers. I've wanted one of these since I saw the announcement but they are very expensive (over £100) so we went with the 16K model instead of the 48K.

It was finally purchased in WH Smiths and we met the guy up in Portlaoise on his way home.

I've never owned anything so complicated and was very excited opening the box and taking out the computer, the power supply, the manuals and the tapes. I hooked it up to our TV and to the power and then started twisting the tuning knob for that station.

But no matter what I did, I couldn't get a picture on the screen. I didn't know if it was the TV or the Spectrum. Cunningly I found the ""beep"" command in the manual but that didn't seem to do anything either.

Our neighbour is a TV repair man and he came around a few days later. It turns out that our Ferguson's tuner couldn't tune that low. So he replaced it and I couldn't believe it when he tuned in the Spectrum and I saw ""Copyright 1982 Sinclair Research"".

The Horizons tape that came with it got boring pretty quickly but the couple of Psion games are good. I have just started learning BASIC from the manual and it is really easy.

I have also just begun buying magazines that are all about Sinclairs and I'm learning about all the games that are available and how the computer works inside.

Some of my friends have Speccys too and one of them realised that we could buy a cable to connect our two tape recorders together and copy games onto blank tapes. Sometimes we have to spend a long time adjusting the tape heads to make it work well. But the games are incredible even if they take ages to load.

I love the games from Quicksilva and Ultimate Play the Game but recently I discovered that most games are now written for the 48K Spectrum. A bunch of people in the magazines advertise memory upgrade chips and I ordered one of them using a sterling bank draft.

It was scary opening up the Spectrum but cool to see the processor and ULA. The socket for the memory chip was obvious and I pushed it in. It worked perfectly!

I hope to learn how to write games and maybe some day I'll be as famous as Matthew Smith who wrote the incredible Manic Miner. I read that he is creating something even better. But what is ""Monty Python""?

The Spectrum is miles better than anything by Commodore or Atari and has many more games than the BBC. It's the best present I ever got.

    <div class=""summary"">This started well but has gone all to hell recently. 2 hours late last night and missing tons of stuff</div> 

<div><span class=""stars"" title=""1"">![](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/1outof5.gif)</span></div>

    <div class=""description"">

Both myself and Catherine have raved about Tesco home delivery in the past. For the first few weeks that we used it, they couldn't put a foot wrong. Then about a month ago the rot started to set in. The man problem was that they  were missing the delivery slots by over an hour in some cases.

Last night they hit rock bottom. When they got to over an hour late, Catherine rang to see what the hell was going on. Half an hour later the driver rang to say that the order had been cancelled by ""someone"" but he still had it and would deliver it. So for a 6pm-8pm slot, we got our stuff at 10pm. His litany of excuses were frankly ridiculous.

Then we saw the list of missing items. Who are they trying to kid? They obviously just gave up as they ran out of time. No Mince. Mince! FFS! Scallions? Nappies? Grapes? Come on,stop treating us like idiots.

Before I forget, the eggs were broken and the lettuce was under a carton of juice. 

It looks to me like they have decided to take the RyanAir approach, have cut everything to the bone and are using too few staff for too big an area. Or worse, maybe it is just old school Ireland where shite is good enough. 

It isn't.

Oh and whilst it is possible to get through to phone support, both the online complaint form and the contact emails are broken. 

UPDATE 1: Catherine rang Tesco and got through to Scotland who told her to ring Wilton. She finally got through to Home Shopping Manager who was courteous and deeply apologetic. She admitted last night was a total disaster and some orders had to be sent out by taxi. It does sound like they are trying to restructure things in there for the better. But the 1 star rating remains until things actualy improve.

    <div class=""description"">

I have to hand it to the BBC people who select the participants in The Apprentice, they always do a superb job. The hard of thinking on Channel 4 who pick those for Big Brother could learn a lot from them.

The first episode was on last week and it delivered everything we've come to expect - top class pseudo-reality TV with a perfect combination of different personality disorders.

The first test was simple; run a static and a mobile coffee kiosk and see who makes most money. But before they even got to that we had the knob who tried to get the name of one of his real-world customers (Certus) as the team name. He got snared big-time. I liked the women's selection of ""Stealth"" as their name. A pointless twist was then added whereby they switched the team-leaders' teams at the last second.

I think everyone on the planet has had a cappuccino at this stage yet one of the teams bought normal ground coffee for their machine by mistake. We also had the quantum physicist who bought 200 litres of milk for the day. A clear case of the ongoing mismatch between gravitational theory and quantum mechanics. Perhaps the ""frothing causes milk expansion"" coefficient is the one they have all been missing to create the grand unified theory?

Both team leaders seemed hell bent on screwing up their own chances by either pulling their vans from good pitches or leaving them in bad ones. I loved the fact that the female team leader (Jadine) felt that the most important part of the ""Eclipse Coffee experience"" was the logo done in powder in the froth. Was she forgetting that this was a one-day test rather than the creation of the next Starbucks?

The nice harmless man (Andy) in charge of the women was pretty useless but well intentioned and got the boot. The physicist will be following him very soon.

Interesting that over half of each team was not shown speaking at all for the entire episode. Are they doing the dark horse thing or was it just an editing approach where they introduce different characters on different weeks?

An added bonus for Irish viewers is that we appear to have a paddy on it and I may know someone who went to school with her.

Wednesdays, 9pm, BBC1

Don't miss the follow-up programme ""You're Fired"" at 10pm on BBC2\. It looks like Badger still doesn't know the meaning of the phrase ""stepping up to the plate"". Will someone please tell her it has nothing to do with dinner?

Review of The Artful Eater,"This is an unusual book made up of a collection of 18 discourses on individual ingredients which were originally distributed as a newsletter. It was first published in 1992 and I was given this 2004 edition by my sister.

[![More LouderVoice Reviews](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/3star.gif)](http://www.loudervoice.com/)

Initial impressions of the book are extremely positive; the writing is of very high quality and the opening treatise on salt catches the imagination. From then on however it seems to alternate between wonderfully interesting chapters and workmanlike almost Wikipedia-style dry listing of facts about certain foods. Very much in the ""did you know"" school of writing.

The good episodes are very very good with those on Country Ham, Eggs and Coffee being my particular favourites. He finishes on the coffee one and it is the highlight of the book. I really hadn't a clue about that ingredient and learned a huge amount in a few compact pages.

One thing that may annoy some readers is the quite parochial US view of the food world displayed in the book.  One almost feels as if he has never travelled outside of its borders. Of course Europe has to be mentioned in the chapter on mustard (another decent one) and apples (slightly disappointing) but I found the writing on dairy and beef to be very one-dimensionally American.

It is one of those books I'm glad I read and I recommend you give it a look if you want a slightly different view of food from a clearly obsessive character."

    <div class=""description"">

After the dire Streets of New York, I didn't have high hopes for The Departed but I loved every minute of this movie from start to finish.

This despite the fact that both Damon and DiCaprio usually annoy the hell out of me. However they both delivered the goods, as did Mark Wahlberg who was fantastic, Martin Sheen who was good and Alec Baldwin who I'm always happy to watch whispering. Add to this Jack Nicholson in his best part in years and you have one hell of a cast.

Basic story is that you have two cops trying to bust open the Irish mafia in Boston. One is on the task force but is actually a mafia mole, the other is undercover and gets into Nicholson's gang. The tension throughout comes from the ""will they get found out"" on both sides.

Towards the end it gets very gory but this does add to the story and there are a few real surprises.

If you're looking for a good solid thriller/drama with a bit of blood, this'll do the trick

    <span class=""description"">

This book has been on my ever growing pile of unread books for a long time. I finally took it on a flight to San Fran so I could make a dent in it. The format is perfect for picking up intermittently since each piece is from a magazine or other publication.

The range of articles is wonderful, ranging from ""Woody Harrelson: Culinary Muse"" about that cretin and the raw food movement to ""Food and Loathing in Las Vegas"" where he and the great Micheal Ruhlman do the frankly bizarre Vegas food scene.

Passion screams from every paragraph that he writes along with a sense of embarassment that he doesn't deserve the fame that he has. This actually stuck me when watching Top Chef recently where he was a guest judge. The competitors were in awe of him but as he points out in several pieces in the book, he was just executive chef in a French-style brasserie in New York. He ain't no Thomas Keller.

This is just a thoroughly enjoyable book where you'll like the writing and like the man. I know have a bunch more places I want to eat in around the world including some stalls in a mall in Singapore!

Review of The Old Post Inn,"We got a voucher from my mother-in-law for The Old Post over a year ago and finally made use of it last weekend. It consisted of one night's stay plus dinner. I've previously [given it top marks](http://conoroneill.com/2007/03/21/review-of-the-old-post-inn/) in a review last year and had eaten there several times before, all good.

We arrived up about 4pm and they weren't fully open yet but some hand waving got us in and up to the room. They had told us on the phone that the rooms are being renovated in the spring and it really can't happen soon enough. Our room really worn out and the bathroom in particular needs to be gutted. One thing that annoyed me intensely was the broken toilet seat. Not only is it unhygienic, it'd probably only take €30 and 20 minutes to fix. But that seat is my abiding memory of the place which is unfortunate as most other aspects are fine.

We headed down for dinner later and found the place hopping. The building is really cosy and I love the genuine friendly local staff. We had a drink whilst reading the menus and waiting for the table. A good selection of my kind of food with a list of each individual supplier impressed me.

The meal overall was good but I felt it could been brilliant with some more attention to detail. Having said that, they were under pressure in the kitchen with a very full dining room and apologised for a delay at one point with a mini-dessert. To be honest we hadn't even noticed.

For starters I had carpaccio of beef with a rocket salad. The beef was gorgeous and delicate but overwhelmed by the over-dressed rocket. You should definitely try it but ask for the salad on the side so the meat can sing. D'wife had prawns with a nice onion marmalade.

The champagne sorbet was very boozy but beautifully flavoured.

My main was Peking duck on celeriac which, whilst very tasty, had flabby soft skin instead of the expected crispness. Catherine had a duo of fish on risotto. The fish was lovely but the risotto looked more like long grain rice and had non-diced stringy rocket it in.

Her dessert was three mini creme brulees which weren't very distinctly different in taste and I had a gorgeous tarte tatin.

Through the meal we had a bottle of Sancerre Dominique et Janine Crochet 2006 which was fantastic and I'd try again.

Being a popular local venue, the portions are seriously big (the side veg was a meal in itself). I always leave there bursting and I need to show some restraint in future!Our room suffered a bit from dining room noise and the place didn't really quieten down until after 1am. But that's to be expected. Breakfast the following morning had both fresh fruit and a really tasty full Irish. Service again was top class and friendly.

Once the rooms are revamped, I'd recommend The Old Post. It's a lovely part of the country and you'll come away refreshed. Oh and to echo [a topic I wrote about](http://www.argolon.com/2008/02/08/irish-smallmicro-businesses-and-the-web/) on my business blog yesterday, they really need to get themselves a web-site!"

    <div class=""description"">

We threw a surprise 60th birthday party for my mother-in-law in The Old Post last weekend. We had eaten there several years ago when it was good but not awesome. All reports recently have said that it is now in the awesome category.

We had a private function room with over twenty people and they did a great job all night on service and getting everyone's food out at the same time.

The fixed four-course menu had tons of seasonal ingredients and lots that I would happily eat. The waitress came to take my order and I couldn't remember the exact name of my starter so I said ""the little bird to start"" ""then the sorbet"". She wondered if I'd be ""going with bambi for the main course"". Ye know, she was right.

The food was wonderful and avoided those tarry intense sauces that are often served with game and overwhelm it. Beautifully cooked, great flavours and top class meat.

The house wines were all excellent and the desserts were spot on.

Since it changed hands, it looks like they no longer have a web-site which is odd. They have a bunch of BandB rooms which we want to try out at some stage.

To get to it, exit off the Cavan bypass at Butlersbridge and follow the signs for the restaurant itself. If you are anywhere in the area, it is worth the detour.

Review of The Poacher's Inn,"The Poacher's Inn is the nearest eatery/pub to our house. In a previous incarnation as Ted Amber's it was an ok pub and a pretty poor restaurant that was barely above the level of a carvery.

The place was bought maybe 18 months ago (or even longer?) and reports have been steadily good. I had a pub lunch there recently and was very impressed so we decided to try the full restaurant last night.

It started badly with no record of the booking we had made a few hours previously but they slotted us in and we were first to dine at 7pm. Service was genuinely friendly throughout with none of the fake bonhomie you often get. The place itself is above the pub with sloping roof, an intimate feel and tables not too close together.

I liked the look of the menu immediately since they were unafraid to have seafood up-front and center. A small set of starters and mains always impresses me more than the kitchen sink approach where you know the freezer and microwave are the main cooking tools.

We were both interested in similar dishes so we made sure to get different things. Missus went with a ""Tapas"" starter and I went for ""Thai"" fish cake. I put both in quotes because I'm not sure how accurate either description is. But that doesn't really matter since both were gorgeous.

The Tapas was a wonderful selection of mussels, shell-on langoustine, salmon, goats cheese, hummus and olives. The fishcake was a big ball of crab and prawn, jam packed with flavour and with a plum sauce (more like diced plum than sauce but beautiful nonetheless).

For main I had scallops and cauliflower puree which was cooked to a tee and very tasty. D'Wife had seabass on a bed of risotto which she adored. In all cases the fish appeared to be ultra fresh and so much better for it. The side veg was a bit of overkill even tho I enjoyed one I couldn't identify (Fennel? Celeriac?). The big chunky chips were very tasty but we didn't need them to be honest.

Both of us were too full for desserts which did look lovely. I'd like to have seen a couple of lighter ones on the menu tho. We went with double espressos instead which were fab.

It wasn't that cheap, coming in at €103 including €27 wine but we thoroughly enjoyed the meal, the music and the feel of the place. As I said in the summary, it is such a joy to have somewhere this good within walking distance of the house. The reputation is clearly spreading too since I have a lunch invite there for next week where the person said ""the chowder is gorgeous"".

A big hurrah, Bandon is finally becoming somewhere that foodies can visit. Take that, Clon!"
Review of The Pressure Cooker (RTE),"The advertising for this programme had me hating its subject before it had even started. It depicted Dylan McGrath, who runs Mint restaurant in Dublin, as an obnoxious Ramsay-knockoff desperate to win a Michelin star. Two minutes into the show I wanted to turn it off. I had no interest in seeing this pompous, arrogant jumped-up little asshole.

Then the rent-a-critics and old men were put to one side and Dylan was allowed to speak. The scales fell from my eyes and I saw a driven, brilliant, witty creator at work. A Ramsay knock-off? You bet - everything that is right about Gordon, I saw in this young guy. Relentless work ethic, constant striving for perfection, inability to suffer fools and a desire to make magical food.

The show focused on his seeming need to win a Michelin star and kept showing clips of other chefs advising him to be patient, build a good business, lose the obsession, stop being so cocky. After a while they got very boring indeed. As Dylan said ""this is Ireland after all"". I was thrilled to see the programme-makers really dig into his motivations, demons and formative experiences as a chef. His quips about collecting gooseberries with his Granny spiked the usual nonsense about where a great chef comes from.

His food is highly stylised and for a short while I was reminded of the infamous Conrad Gallagher. I was surprised the naysayers didn't mention his name in fact. But the thing that struck me about the plates they showed was that they seemed unique and they looked gorgeous. The trip to his salad guy in the UK was a joy. Two obsessives discussing baby salad leaves in the shape of butterflies. Dylan mentioned that the guy had gone bust a few times. You could see why.

And then the highlight of the programme. After little more than a year and a half running Mint, he got his star. A lesser programme would have cut to scenes of the old bluffers looking bashful and apologetic. They didn't need to, the message came across loud and clear; this guy is going to be huge.

Please please please RTE, make more programmes like this. The desires I expressed in my last review were all fulfilled by this show. Please tell me why it's only a once off. I guess it is costly to make deep, incisive, educational, moving television. So dump the fluff and make more of these. Now, where's the telephone number for Mint......"

This restaurant is part of the Orchard pub in Cavan. It is always busy and serves bog standard globo-food like wings, burgers, salads etc.

In the past it has been very hit and miss but we had a fine meal there last week. Nothing special but nothing wrong either.

Simple feta and sundried tomato salad was good with a decent dressing. Too large tho. Wife's deep fried brie a bit tasteless but ok.

Mains were a reasonable stuffed chicken breast with ok veg and spuds for me and generic pasta dish for Catherine. They offered her chips or potato with that.......

Good bottle of house Italian red plus two other drinks and we were out the door in less than an hour for slightly over €80.

You could do a lot worse. +353 (0)49 433 1819

    <div class=""description"">

Malcolm Gladwell's book really rocketed him into worldwide fame. Everything he has done since has been eagerly awaited. I only got around to reading The Tipping Point on Thursday and I'm glad I finally did.

The basic idea behind the book is that there are identifiable conditions and actions which cause something to become wildly popular or successful - things that become epidemics (in the wider sense of the word). He describes each of these and then backs them up with a continuous stream of convincing examples.

Some of the examples given include the enormous sudden reduction in crime in New York in the late 90's, the massive success of certain shoe brands and books, the global phenomena that were Sesame Street and Blue's Clues and a ton of others.

He picks out common attributes, context and actors in each one. In the case of the actors in any success he identifies The Connector, The Maven and the  Saleman. Each of these plays a different role in making something successful.

Some of the concepts he describes include:

*   The Law of the Few
*   Stickiness
*   The Power of Context
*   The Magic Number 150
*   The New Product Cycle

I found his material on children, learning and kids TV programmes particularly interesting and accurate.

It's a very light read and he race through it. Something useful or entertaining on every page.

Now I'd better go out and buy Blink.

Review of The Trail Runner's Companion by Sarah Lavender Smith,"I [wrote about my first 50k](https://conoroneill.com/2017/07/23/the-chiltern-challenge-50k-conors-first-ultra-marathon/) a few weeks back. I still smile every time I think about it. I'm already signed up for a 40 miler in the [Glen of Aherlow](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1506) in September (3 loops, so I have a get-out-of-jail) and I'm trying to decide what my first 50 miler will be. Suffice to say, I'm really getting into this whole trail running thing. And one of the main reasons for that is the brilliant work done by YouTubers, Instagrammers and Podcasters in this area.

My two fave Ultra/Trail podcasts are [Ultra Runner Podcast](http://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/) and [East Coast Trail and Ultra Podcast](http://eastcoastultrapodcast.com/). They are verrrrry different beasts (pun intended) but both awesome resources for getting excited, inspired and educated about ultra running. Eric on URP is often joined by [Sarah Lavender Smith](http://www.sarahlavendersmith.com/) and I always look forward to those episodes due to the depth of her knowledge and utter likability.

Which brings us to books about running. I have to admit I'm not having a lot of success with these. Most of them are written by runners, not writers, and you can tell. I was genuinely sad to find Lizzy Hawker's book to be basically an unreadable mix of ""and then, and then"" with fortune cookie quotes. Lizzy is an absolute legend of a runner and I'm in awe of her achievements. At the other end you have books like ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Running"", written by Haruki Murakami, a famous author. I have to admit I found this mind-numbing too. I have a few others on the Kindle I've started but given up on. I even gave up half way through Dean Karnazes audiobook. And he's another person I idolize.

So to-date, I've only really enjoyed three books about running: 

1. [Born to Run](http://www.chrismcdougall.com/buy-born-to-run-from-these-sellers/) by Christopher McDougall
2. [Nowhere Near First: Ultramarathon Adventures From The Back Of The Pack](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nowhere-Near-First-Ultramarathon-Adventures-ebook/dp/B01KW37P5M) by Cory Reese
3. [The Trail Runner's Companion](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trail-Runners-Companion-Step-Step-ebook/dp/B071WDHGCW) by Sarah Lavender Smith

Born to Run is that got me into running in the first place and would make even the most dedicated couch-potato excited. It's also the reason I ran in VFFs for a few years. Christopher's other book, [Natural Born Heroes](http://www.chrismcdougall.com/buy-natural-born-heroes-from-these-sellers/), is also a must-read. It's sorta about running but really it's about a lot more. 

I discovered Cory's book in Sarah's book. As I mentioned in my 50K post, I read the entire thing the night before my first Ultra and it was a huge help in settling my nerves. Cory is funny, genuine and full of grit. Even if you don't run, buy the book, it'll make you want to do more.

And so on to The Trail Runner's Companion. I didn't just enjoy this book, it's the one I'll be reading over and over. It's a practical instruction manual for doing ultra trail running well. It's mixed with lovely anecdotes and all of the nuts and bolts instructions are done in a really approachable way.

The more I read it, as I approached the 50k, the more I realised just how badly I'd prepared. It turns out that running around a few Irish forests and hills for 4 or 5 miles, plus doing a few road marathons, is not really how you approach an Ultra. Of course I bought the book so close to the event, that I had no chance to actually implement her advice. 

The really important aspect of the book is that anyone of any level of ability can use it. I find a lot of online advice assumes you are already a fast runner and you are just transitioning to trails. Sarah doesn't do this. So a blob like me can still apply her instructions without ending up in the physio's office with everything torn and out of action for months.

If you want one take-away from the book, it's ""do more hill repeats"". Something I avoid like the plague but which I'm really going to have to embrace.

I said it in the last post and I'll say it again - ""Inspirational"" should mean ""Inspired me to action"". And that's what books like Sarah's do. You read them and you think ""ye know, I could do that, I just have to try"". There are things I have no interest in ever doing like 24 hour track loops. But there are others that I am now seriously considering. Events like OCC, CCC, UTMB, JFK50 and hell yes, even Western States (I know, I know). Sarah's book gives me the training map for getting myself to a place where these are not ridiculous ambitions for a heavy 49 year old who staggers around 26 miles on a regular basis.

I'll extend something I wrote in 2015 after the London Marathon:

> If you told me in 2008 that I’d ever run a 10k, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2009 that I’d ever run a half marathon, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2011 that I’d ever run a marathon, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2014 that I’d ever run two marathons in 5 weeks, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2015 that I'd ever run 5 marathons in a year, I'd have laughed at you. And if you told me in 2016 that I'd ever run 50k cross-country, I'd have laughed at you.

I'll update the quote again next year :-)

Finally, I couldn't do a post about running this week without mentioning [The Pacemakers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b092l5gd) documentary. It ties in perfectly to what I'm saying above. It's about a group of highly competitive athletes who are attending the World Championships. The twist is that they are all over 90.

The trailer:

I want to be 95 and running down a track against some other 95 year olds and trying to whip their assses. Don't you?

<div><span class=""stars"" title=""4"">![](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/4outof5.gif)</span></div>

    <div class=""description"">

Our eldest was badgering us yesterday that we never eat in ""proper restaurants"" so we scooted into town with the plan to either go to Captain America's (a first for all of us) or Wagamama nxt door (which I'd eaten in last year).

We arrived up and made the snap decision to go for Wagamama. It was before 5pm on a Saturday and was almost empty. We got a full bench to ourselves and sorted out the kids seating arrangements. There was a baby seat for baba.

Crayons and play sheets were provided immediately and the waiter gave us the kids menus and stayed until we picked the kids food. Chicken and Noodles all round. The food arrived in less than five minutes. These are people who know how to deal with kids!

![Chicken and Noodles](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1425/820269919_3cc20c6bf8.jpg) 

I was thrilled that the three eldest and dug into food which they would not normally touch. They loved the soy based sauce and the only bit they really didn't like was the salad leaves.

![Noodle eating](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1002/821142694_093fffd1b2.jpg) 

The highlight for them was the kid's chopsticks. 

![Chopsticks](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1059/821143978_64a9bddb6f.jpg) 

Only tiny drawback on the kid-front was that the baby seats are too low and babba whacked her head off the edge of the table twice.

The kids all got an apple-orange juice mix which was clearly freshly squeezed. I had a similar one with addition of passion fruit and it was gorgeous.

Catherine went for Chilli Chicken Men and liked it overall apart from the huge chunks of courgette and the undercooked peppers.

I had  classic Yaki Soba which is very like Singapore Chow Mein which I've always loved. Nice and spicy, lots of chicken and shrimp. My kind of chinese food.

Catherine had a Japanese Iki beer which she loved. I tasted it and thought it was fab too. Later that night I was in Boqueria and drank nothing else. Try it out.

![Iki Beer](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1322/821146952_5c62a9be1f.jpg) 

Ice-cream for the kiddies rounded it off nicely 

Loos were all separate lockable cubicles which is pefect for multiple bringing kids too.

I really can't say anything seriously negative about this place. The food is not incredible by any means but it is simple, tasty and is much more preferable to filling yourself to the gills with stodge before drinks. I can see why Wagamama is a global phenomenon. 

€83 for two adults and four kids is pretty good value too.

Rosmini Community Event Needs Your Help,"I'll keep it short and sweet. If you know of any family-friendly comedians or mind-trick guys who would be able to perform on March 26th in Bandon, can you get in touch with me and I'll pass it on to the Rosmini Centre people? They do have some budget for it, so pro or semi-pro is fine.

Also the dog owned by one of the kids who was going to perform has gone missing. Please keep an eye out for a sheepdog in the Crossbarry area. If the same happens to you, I encourage you to post it on [LostandFound.ie](http://www.lostandfound.ie/lostform.html)."
Rosscarbery Surf Turf n Tar - An instant classic Half Marathon,"This is going to be a post full of superlatives. 

When I first heard about [Surf Turf n Tar](https://surfturfntar.com/), I was instantly excited. I'd done most of the course in chunks already and it's currently my favourite place to run. You have every sort of terrain and views, all in a compact area.

![Surf Turf n Tar](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/surf-turf-ntar.jpg)

The race started just opposite the Celtic Ross Hotel and headed down a little road. You hear of elite ultra runners ""blowing-up"" at 50 miles. I blew up at 50 yards where both calves cramped badly as I tried to keep up with my wife. 

So much for my brand new schoolgirl 2XU compression socks helping with that.

![2XU](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-05-20%2007.57.06.jpg)

As we ran along I was trying to figure out how the hell we were supposed to get across the inlet/estuary. There's always at least some bit of stream there. We bounced out on to the sand at that really cool house right on the water and ran across the sand. A few foot-dunks in puddles confirmed that wearing Altra Lone Peak 3.0 trail runners was the right choice :-) And then I spotted it, a pontoon bridge across the stream! The wee geniuses. 

Over we ran to the relatively newly finished cliff walk and immediately dropped to a walk. Damn that's steep.

Along the road in Owneahincha and then into the ""beware the bull"" field. I was really looking forward to this section as I'd finally get to see the old Castelfreke building up close. It's private property with lots of ""stay out"" signs so it was a real coup for the organisers to get permission.

Every time we got to a steep bit, people passed me as I was only power walking (and still in pain with my calves). But when we hit the downhills, I bombed past them like a small child with my arms outstretched relying on the grip of the LPs to keep me off my ass.

The forest bits were as lovely as always with amazing smells of wild garlic. Then the heavens opened and we were all saturated. But it was exactly what I needed.

I really like new trail above Long Strand and hope the planting of native species to replace the removed poxy pines continues.

Back on to the road and up to the bastard Long Strand. This is my third race which goes out on to that torture chamber. It's not the fact that it's a beach which hurts, it's the fact that the weird sand never becomes dense. Every footstep sinks in deep. Your legs are like lead by the end of it.

Here it is back in March on a foggy day.

![Long Strand](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-03-30%2015.22.26.jpg)

Then up the really steep hill I love to the best view in the area, past the holy cross. and another high speed bombing session down the other side of the hill. 

Only 3 miles left now, so it should be a doddle. Noooooo, into the dunes of Owenahinca for more soft sand. The evil evil brilliant geniuses.

Back up over the cliff walk and surely it's just a jog along on the road? Nooooooooo again, as we're directed out on to the Warren beach and then on to sand that's even softer than Long Strand. I'm almost staggering at this stage. And the tide is coming in close to the markers. 

Finally the 13 mile marker. But where the hell is the finish line? The hotel is a lot more than 0.1 of a mile away. So I jog along the road, turn a corner and hurrah, the finish line. 

Seriously, this is the kind of course that makes you want to run all the time. It may have taken my calves 6 miles to loosen up but who cares? I can't congratulate the organisers enough. Everything was absolutely brilliantly done and it's the best Half marathon course I've ever run.

And the most amazing part of the whole thing? The medal was made of chocolate!

![Medal01](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-05-20%2013.41.53.jpg)

RTE finally has a new Darina and his name is Martin Shanahan,"With a single episode, the greatest TV show RTE have made about food in at least 25 years. Martin Shanahan jumps out of the screen, grabs you by the scruff of the neck and demands that you watch him and start loving fish.

After decades of dreary formulaic yawn inducing food programmes on Irish TV or worse, the ""crayzzzzze kooky"" shows, someone in RTE finally saw an episode of Jamie Oliver and realised what was missing - personality.

Where has Martin been hiding all this time? In the kitchens of the rightly legendary Fishy Fishy in Kinsale? He's a force of nature. He is everything that made Darina a legend - knowledge,passion, humour. But he goes far beyond that, he's an absolute TV natural. He belongs in front of the camera. Dammit he _owns_ the camera.

![](http://dynimg.rte.ie/00033429-250.jpg ""Martin Shanahan"")

Honestly, I was rivetted for 30 minutes. It is perfect food TV. This show doesn't just have potential, this could go global. With sub-titles of course. Joke joke!

And the fish, lord the fish. We're not having our regular Friday Chicken Tikka Masala tonight, we are doing the mackerel dish that Martin showed instead. He had that much impact. And that's the other thing, every bloody RTE food show tells you how to do dinner party food. Who the hell has dinner parties? Martin shows you how to cook gorgeous tasty healthy food quickly, for you!

If you missed the first episode, kick yourself hard and just be thankful RTE now has it on the [RTE Player](http://www.rte.ie/player/#v=1071348) (even if it built on the proprietary dying Realplayer technology, but that's a topic for another blogpost).

Hopefully this show will also be the kick up the arse Kinsale needs to start living up again to its long-undeserved 1970s ""Gourmet Capital of Ireland"" tag. Quick, name five places in Kinsale you would travel an hour to eat in. Exactly.

Top Chef is the only food TV show for years that I actively look forward to seeing each week. Martin Shanahan has created a second."
RTE Radio Show Downloads,"I'm not a radio person so I tend to miss a wealth of interesting programmes, particularly in the evenings. I have only just found out about [Winter Food on RTE1](http://www.rte.ie/radio1/winterfood/) presented by Cork's own Clodagh McKenna. I was very happy to see that recordings of the show (and archives) were available. Unfortunately there are a few problems, but I have solutions to some of them:

[1] The shows are in Real Player rm format rather than MP3\. Luckily my MP3 player is Real Audio on a Palm so it isn't actually a problem for me.

[2] There is no RSS feed for this programme. RTE actually do have RSS feeds for their top level stuff like the news but not fine-grained to enable me to subscribe to updates on Winter Food.

In fact, what the hell is stopping them from going the whole hog and embracing podcasting properly and making all of their programming available via something like Podcast Alley? Today FM do it for Gift Grub on iTunes but obviously we don't want anything which makes people install that dire software on their PCs. They should have a look over at [The Restaurant Guys](http://www.restaurantguysradio.com/sle/rg/) in New Jersey - a food programme on a commercial radio station (WCTC) that is fully setup for MP3 downloads to anyone worldwide.

Does anyone know what RTE's intentions are in this area as a publicly funded broadcaster? It would take minimal capital investment to set this up. I know I'd spend a lot more time listening to RTE programmes if I could dictate when I get to listen to their output on the move.

[3] You can't actually download the files for later listening, you have to listen to them in realtime on your computer. This is the same stupid limitation set by BBC radio which I found a solution for when I wanted to grab the H2G2 broadcasts from last year. Follow my instructions over at [this post ](http://conoroneill.com/2005/05/17/recording-streaming-audio-for-later-listening/)(mainly to do with setting up [MPlayer](http://www2.mplayerhq.hu)), find out when the programme you want was broadcast e.g. February 18th and then download it using MPlayer using a command line in a DOS prompt like the following:

mplayer -dumpfile winterfood20060218.ra -dumpstream rtsp://streaming2.rte.ie/2006/0218/18022006rte-winterfood.rm

Unfortunately this downloads in realtime so it'll take the full half hour to grab but when it is done you'll have a Real Audio file to use to your hearts content.

If you need MP3 then you'll have to grab [LAME from here](http://www.free-codecs.com/Lame_Encoder_download.htm) and copy it to the same dir as MPlayer. Then execute the following two commands:

mplayer winterfood20060218.ra -ao pcm -ao pcm:file=winterfood20060218.wav

lame -f  winterfood20060218.wav winterfood20060218.mp3

Note that the mplayer step above takes up crazy amounts of disk space (3 meg real audio file becoming a multi-gig wav file) and you may run out if you have a small hard drive.

Of course, what would be far better would be a little script which ran once a week and grabbed the latest episode for you and converted it if needed. I'm gonna have a bit of spare time in the next few weeks so I may hack some travesty of a script together and make it available here.

The above instructions apply to any of the RTE programmes which they make available for later listening. You do have to figure out the ""path"" to the file which you do as follows: right-click on the ""listen to this show"" link, save it to your desktop, open the smil file in notepad and find the rstp path in that file and use it in place of the rstp link in the command line above. Hardly slick.

Run Forest Run trail race report. Loved it!,"As you may have read in my previous post, I've been dipping my toe into running off-road. The phrase ""trail running"" still seems pretty rare in Ireland where I see ""mountain running"" mentioned more often, and ""fell running"" in the UK.

Last week my wife spotted on the [Running in Cork blog](https://corkrunning.blogspot.ie/) that there was a trail run on in Castlefreke/Rathbarry on Sunday 18th called [Run Forest Run](https://www.facebook.com/Run-Forest-Run-175750705775650/?fref=ts). It instantly got me interested as it was [a] nearby and [b] only 5 miles long. I have just spent 11 days sick on and off after a trip to Vietnam. Top tip - don't brush your teeth with the tap-water, even in a high-end hotel. I'm doing the Berlin Marathon next Sunday, so the big question I wanted to answer yesterday was ""am I well enough for Berlin yet?"". 

For the laugh I asked my 14yo and the 17yo sons if they wanted to do it with me. I was shocked when they both said yes. Their mother then added the sweetener of €20 for the winner between the three of us. Neither of them have done much more than a bit of running in school, so I was very impressed by their enthusiasm.

You can see the Strava route and Ordnance Survey map below. A lovely mix of path, trail, road, forest and beach in a beautiful part of West Cork.

Unfortunately, Sunday morning welcomed us with lashing rain. But what the hell, in for a penny, in for €20. The start/finish was the [Galleyflash Rowing Club](http://www.galleyflash.com/) on Kilkern lake. A few people were there when we arrived and sadly the numbers didn't really grow. In the end, they dropped the 5km and only 19 of us lined out for the 5 miler. I figure there were three reasons for turnout: [1] the rotten weather [2] the Charleville Half Marathon with nearly 1000 people was on the same day and [3] the lack of much publicity for it. 

![Lake](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_113913.jpg)

But we didn't mind in the slightest.

![Start](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_115939.jpg)

Off we went and we quickly ended up at the back of the field. But the two boys looked solid and we were doing a decent pace for n00bs. They slowed down a bit going into Castlefreke Woods and then grinded to a slow walk going up the first hill in the woods. 

![Woods](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_121814.jpg)

We picked the pace back-up and did the road stretch quickly. Then on to the nasty-assed hill up to the large cross. 

![Hill](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_124653.jpg)

The downhill was brilliant fun and we ran the whole thing. Here's a video which gives some sense of the fantastic location and views. Apologies for the relentless heavy breathing.

{{< youtube _NhKnpDfQXI >}}

The final mile on the beach was brilliantly horrific with huge patches of soft sand you couldn't avoid. Then back on to the road for a bit and to the Rowing club. The 14yo came in first of us, having found a great second wind. The 17yo hurt his achilles on the beach and came in last. But I was incredibly proud of them both. 8.4km is no joke off-road in the lashing rain when you have done no training for it.

Tea and biccies sorted us out before we drove home.

I really want to thank the organisers and helpers for a superb event. Everything was absolutely top notch from the signage to the stewards. I'd particularly call out the young guy at the end of the beach who had to stand there watching 3 slowly moving bodies in the rain for an interminable duration so he could tell us where to go.

I'll be making lots of noise about this event next year to try and drive up the numbers. Honestly, even if you've never run before, you'll love this route and the terrain.

The [IMRA also did an event here](https://www.imra.ie/events/details/id/1339/) in February. I'm aiming to do that if it's on next year.

If you know of any other trail events like this in West Cork, do let me know!

Oh and yes, I think I'll be fine for Berlin.

Update 1: There is now a [Running in Cork post](http://corkrunning.blogspot.ie/2016/09/results-photos-of-run-forest-run-5m-in.html) about it and a [gallery of pics on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Run-Forest-Run-175750705775650/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1445859345431440)."
Salt Lick BBQ Driftwood Texas - Can I have a franchise please?,"We brought the rain with us from Cork and it lashed down as we were driven out to the Salt Lick BBQ which is, as they (and probably Ned Flanders) would put it ""a heck of a long way out yonder"". It is also in a dry county where the sale (but not consumption) of alcohol is illegal. I think many of my Irish readers have probably had some sort of aneurysm reading that last sentence. Imagaine trying to create a dry county in Ireland. Well maybe in Leitrim after the last person leaves.
Joe kindly brought a cooler full of beer (which is the legal way to deal with it). He also pointed out that in some dry counties, the restaurants give you the booze for free but ask that you might take it into consideration in the gratuity. Where there is a will....

I predicted we would be the only patrons due to the horrendous weather. Nope, the place was jammed - on a wet monday night. That tells you how popular it really is. Joe told us that one one summer weekend they sold 5000 lbs of meat. I jest you not. My plan for tonight was to make some progress towards that 5000 number.

It's a real rustic place that looks like a bunch of sheds clustered together. A lot of smoke has been generated here over the past many years:

I immediately imagined people in wheelchairs being thrown out of fast-moving pick-up trucks.

Then their menu decided to insult everyone over the age of 60 (I think maybe they are joshing here):

Mmm, mmm, ribs and sausage:

Did I get seconds? Darn tootin I did!

The food was awesome. The brisket, oh dear god, how do they make it so succulent? Even the sides were great - slaw and potato salad. Cormac did point out rightly that a big pile of creamy mashed spuds would have made it totally perfect.

We asked about the cooking of the food. The brisket gets 14 hours, the ribs and sausage a lot less. This is the main prep area. I'm not sure if this smoker is for show or is really used:

[![Image108](http://static.flickr.com/42/87669775_f1666a4b82_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/87669775/ ""Photo Sharing"")

It really is an incredible place doing the same very small set of fabulous food for many years. We could all learn from their focus. As I'm such a total geek, I had to buy some merchandise. The t-shirts are hilarious and I obviously had to get their triple back of hot sauce, dry rub and BBQ sauce. There'll be smoke in Bandon soon:

This sign got me all excited until I remembered that nationwide does not mean Ireland. Damn. They will ship a cooked 5lb brisket in the US for $49.95.

What amazes me is the value for money. $15.95 for all you can eat  of top quality food. I would love to see what this could be done for in Ireland.

A great night had by all and a long bloated trip back to the hotel.

Jack K may be the devil. The following morning we had a business breakfast in the office and he had arranged breakfast tacos. Oh no, I was still full from last night. Actually, oh yes. Eggs, bacon and cheese with chilli and salsa. Perks you up for sure. Then lunch; the evil swine gets BBQ from Rudy's, whose byline is great ""the worst BBQ in Texas"". This was also superb. Lunch:

And to round it all off, the spawn of satan takes us for dinner at a Surf n Turf joint called Trulucks. Great seafood and awesome steaks. I had a top chat with Timmy D about Food Franchises which might work in Ireland. Some of his ideas has me crying with laughter into my food.

I'll be going back to Trulucks once I get my pants taken out. Our kind hosts rolled us back to the hotel. It is now the following morning and I don't think I'll be eating for a week. I shudder to think what Jack has arranged for breakfast today. Beef sushi?

Saturday in Dungarvan,"We spent Saturday in and around Dungarvan visiting Catherines cousin Maria. They live near Clonea Strand which is a fantastic beach. Myself and the boys whiled away an hour or two digging holes and filling them with stones. We stayed in the [Clonea Strand Hotel](http://www.clonea.com) - a good mid-market place with some fantastic (non-ironic) 70's interiors. Big high ceilings and open stairs. Beds could do with replacing but a top spot with great kids facilities. The three monsters loved the new Kids Loft with climbing frames, slides, tons of plastic balls etc. Good pool too. Shockingly Oscar thought it was better than Disney Paris. Mentalist.

We had dinner in the [Tannery](http://www.tannery.ie). Knew it was going to be good but it was fabulous. Very friendly staff, interesting but not ridiculous food (e.g. Creme Brulee of Crab) and a wonderful building. I had a duck ravioli on puy lentils and chuocroute to start. Nearly licked the plate. Of course I had confused charcuterie and choucroute yet again and was expecting pig parts, not sauerkraut but it was delish anyway. Two itsy bitsy teeny weeny quail for main were literally finger-licking good and the semi-freddo with pineapple was just the right mix of sweet and tart. Catherines Crabby thing looked fab, her monkfish was the size of a small child and she rated her chocolate fondant thingy as the best desert she has had in a long long time. The only tiny glitch was a poor young-fella thinking that 1 D espresso on an order was decaffeinated espresso rather than a double. Ok so I laughed. Meal was very good value too. Run, don't walk, run to this restaurant as soon as you can."
Sausage Semi-Success Satisfies,"And so on to attempt number three. This time I followed the advice of Podchef Neal and others regarding keeping everything as cold as possible when trying to mince the pork. So I stood outside for half an hour.

More usefully, I put the mincer attachment in the freezer for the day and used meat which had barely defrosted. Lo and behold, the meat flew through the mincer. I was using the coarsest holeage (I'm tired, I have no idea what the right term is for that) and so had to run the meat through again. Even tho I had re-cooled eveything (I lay in a bath of ice water for 10 minutes), it must not have been enough because the second run had a bit of jammage (feel free to use that new word in conversation). But still far far better than before.

[![One giant sausage](http://static.flickr.com/35/98659331_ff956895ff_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/98659331/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I went with a very simple flavouring of a hint of parsley, sage, thyme and oregano all fresh from the cat wee area at the front of the house, a good blast of white pepper and some salt. I probably didn't use enough bread crumbs. This time I went with hog casings which are the bigger ones. The fillage was a bit fiddly but went fine and the linkage was a disaster with the resulting sossies ranging from 1 inch to 6 inches (or 0.25cm to 3cm on a female ruler).

[![Sausage Links](http://static.flickr.com/34/98659358_92a73da295_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/98659358/ ""Photo Sharing"")

The hangage went fine overnight and I cooked them up the following morning. During frying I realised my biggest mistake - overfillage of the sausages. The meat started pushing out through the ends of the casings and after ten minutes I must have had over a centimetre of liquid in the pan.

[![More sausages sizzling](http://static.flickr.com/43/98659386_1b21590c5e_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/98659386/ ""Photo Sharing"")

It was therefore no surprise that they were very dry again and the texture was too dense due to the lack of bread crumbs. But they tasted really great, as good as shop bought in my humble estimation. I had them with a lovely organic egg from Tesco and some very succulent Danish rashers from the same source.

I highly recommend that you temporarily buy these tasty offerings from Denmark, at least whilst Riots R Us are having this week's riot on the topic of cartoons. Next week's riot will be back to the usual topic of why America is the great satan and will be protesting NBC's cancellation of ""Jihad Idol"".

Actually, it might be a good idea to stock up on bacon in general. At the rate our dear president is offering to swap our rights [for improved business in the Middle East](http://www.breakingnews.ie/2006/02/12/story244376.html), she'll probably have got the eating of pork banned in Ireland by the end of her trip.

Three attempts at sausage making and still not perfect. A lesser man would give up and just buy Denny. But then I've been cooking steaks for 20 years and I still get that wrong on a regular basis. I think the next attempt will focus on keeping them juicy. One question I still have on filler is whether the 20% or so that is recommended is by weight or volume. It'd surely take a whole hell of a lot of breadcrumbs to make up 20%?

Science Week in November,"There is a wonderful bunch of things planned in Cork as part of [Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.ie/) which will hopefully increase the interest in science amongst kids. The target audience is 10-16 year olds but I'm sure we'll drag our 8 year old along to some of it.

It is on from 11th Nov to 18th Nov in various locations around the city. I believe the HQ is City Hall and local tech companies will have stands there. Many of the events will be in UCC.

Check out the web-site [for a full list](http://www.scienceweek.ie/sw2007/results.asp?sregion=Cork&saudcat=%25&) of what is happening and make sure to book the ones that require it.

I'd like to go to ""It's Elemental! Role of elements in our everyday life""."
Science Week: Invention of the future,"Today's [Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.ie/) question is ""**What invention do you want to see most in the future**"". This is an easy one to describe but it'll be a long time coming. I want to see an inexpensive non-invasive home medical diagnostic machine that can detect and diagnose a wide range of problems on its own and via a data-feed to the relevant medical experts.

The benefits of such a machine could be enormous

*   Massive reduction in GP queues
*   Reduction in incorrect self-medication (e.g. anti-biotics for viral infections)
*   Prompt addressing of potentially dangerous conditions
*   Diagnosis by subject-area experts globally rather than by potentially incompetent local hospitals
*   Blue Sky: Your own portable MRI with ""lump"" detection

We are starting to see this sort of thing appear here and there, from equipment for diabetics to portable defibrilators to the awesome sleep-apnea equipment by the [BiancaMed](http://www.biancamed.com/home/index.php) guys. Some day we'll get to the point where your health isn't in the hands of a dysfunctional bureaucracy and you'll control your own destiny."
Science Week: Invention which helps work,"Today's [Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.ie/) Question is an easy one ""**Which invention has helped you most with your working life?**"". Of course it is the internet. The highlights of my history with it are as follows:

*   1990: Learned it existed when I started Masters in UCD
*   1991: Figured out email, Usenet news, Gopher. Discovered ftp.funet.fi and the world of shareware
*   1992: First job in S3\. Email only. Figured out ftpmail to download programs overnight on 14.4k modem
*   1994: Found out about the web. Used Mosaic for the first time
*   1995: Discovered Free software, FSF, GPL, Open Source OS called RTEMS and GCC.Yahoo, Excite, Altavista, Lycos
*   1996-2000: Web developed and so did I. Online purchasing, Google, Yahoo mail, IOL, indigo, eircom.net, ISDN, Netscape, Mozilla, Internet Explorer, Geocities, homepages, animated gifs
*   2001-2003: Startup with ISDN only. Discovered SEO, dmoz, blogging, RSS
*   2003-now: Live it and breath it 16 hours a day. DSL, mobile, ATOM, Reviews, Semantic Web, Web 2.0, Social Networking, IM, Skype, Firefox, Widgets, Flash

The greatest invention in my lifetime and my job would not exist without it."
Science Week: Next gadget purchase,"Today's [Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.ie/) Question is ""**What’s the next gadget that you want to buy?**""

The next gadget I buy hasn't been created yet. It'll be when Nokia take the N95 and the N810 and merge them into one product. 

This:

[![Nokia_N95](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2309/2031909610_2da5fbc251_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2031909610/ ""Nokia_N95 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

plus this:

[![nokia_n810](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2337/2031909316_40c489969d_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2031909316/ ""nokia_n810 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

It will have:

*   Quad Band Phone
*   5MP Camera with xenon flash
*   HSDPA 3G Data
*   Wifi
*   Bluetooth
*   Stereo Bluetooth Audio
*   GPS
*   Touch Screen
*   Slide Out Keyboard
*   Run a variant of Linux
*   TV Out
*   Accelerometer
*   Massive Battery
*   Take massive memory cards
*   Offer full PDA functionality and sync with both desktop apps like Outlook and online apps like Goog Calendar
*   A music player designed for podcasts (remember last spot, bookmark, speedy seek within track)
*   VOIP
*   SIP
*   the same dimensions as the N810
*   A price tag of less than €400

I don't ask for much really, do I? Actually, this device would make me the ultimate ""mobile warrior"". The need for a laptop would almost disappear for a lot of my travel and I would have a swiss-army penknife of gadget functionality."
Scoozi's - Good for a Friday night bash,"Maria, our summer student, finished up on Friday. We bounced around a few ideas for nosh and settled on something we figured everyone would like - Scoozi's on Winthrop Ave just near the GPO in Cork.

Great buzz in the place on arrival and no delay getting seated (well it was 5.30 on a Friday). A bit disappointed that there was no beer on the menu - I had imagined big jugs of the stuff in the middle of the table.&nbsp; A few bottles of Chianti did the trick and the hard-liquor-drinkers just had to wait for the pub. Most people has the bruschetta for starters. I have read one review of the place and the comment on the bruschetta was that it is not what you expect but it is tasty. I have to second that. I'm a sun-blush tomato addict and they were covered in em. Having said that,&nbsp; it was really just door-stopper toast with melted cheese! 

I had a pizza whose name evades me (Ciprioconi, Ciccatori, I dunno) - anyway, olives, cheese, pepperoni and anchvoies. Not bad at all but I did think the base was bought in rather than cooked on the premises. And I was stuffed after it.

The others had a variety of pizzas, pasta and burgers. The pasta looked only ok but the burgers looked fantastic - particularly the buns used. I couldn't fit dessert and had a top-notch double espresso. The others loved what they got&nbsp; - and again huge portions.

The best part of the night? Meal for 6 with 2 bottles of wine - &euro;168\. That is just great value for what we received. Service was top notch and the tip reflected that.

So if you want something that is fast, tasty and great value then check them out.

p.s. pints afterwards in The Long Valley. A Cork institution I'm told. Loved it, my kind of pub - old, not jammed, music not blaring, good pints,  interesting  loos. Definitely going back."
Sean O'Sullivan on The Late Late Show. Just Watch it.,"This is probably the first and last time I'll ever post a clip from the Late Late Show. Despite Tubbs excruciating interviewing style, Sean O'Sullivan blew my socks off. From a family of 9 with a dead-beat Dad to huge success. He runs his current business, Avego, from Kinsale. We need more people like him talking about Engineering and Creativity together. If you want your children to create the future, nudge them in that direction.

13 minutes really just left me wanting more. Given that the Late Late cannot compete for ""celebrity"" guests with the UK chatshows, how about more time on fewer meatier guests like this from now on?

See where the NAMA Properties are on Google Maps,"Well done to Gavin Sheridan and the crew at [The Story](http://thestory.ie/). They took NAMA's pathetic PDF release of the properties it owns, extracted the data into the fantastic Google Fusion Tables and then [mapped the results](http://thestory.ie/2011/07/30/nama-enforcement-properties-mapped) into Google Maps.

Go on, you know you won't be able to help yourself. I immediately zoomed into Bandon to see what was there. Surprisingly few properties actually.

[Head on over to the site](http://thestory.ie/2011/07/30/nama-enforcement-properties-mapped/) and click on any dot of interest to see what property it is. Some of the locations will be off as they rely on Google accurately converting text addresses to lat/long. Of course if we had a Post Code system in Ireland, we wouldn't have that problem. What's the current prediction for that? 2015?

Shockingly - Yayyy Vodafone,"So [I bitched about Voda](http://conoroneill.com/2006/08/22/yayyy-nokia-boooo-vodafone/) ([twice](http://conoroneill.com/2006/06/14/now-im-not-saying-vodafone-read-my-blog-but/)) and the fact that I couldn't upgrade the software on my N70 mobile. Then Ciarán, an old workmate, pointed out that I could get the phone unlocked by just calling customer service. 

It turns out that they have to ask Nokia for the unlock codes for the N-series, five days later they texted me the code and now the phone can work with any SIM card (like [Roam4Free](http://blog.roam4free.ie/) for example). I never knew they would do this so good on them. I'm still on a long contract with them so I guess they don't really care.

I then re-tried the software upgrade of the phone ([as previously described](http://conoroneill.com/2006/08/22/yayyy-nokia-boooo-vodafone/)) and the beauty worked! I have no idea if it is related to the unlocking or it is just a coincidence but I now have the latest (bar one) version of the N70 software and I'm a happy bunny. 

The main obvious change is that it just seems faster, particularly the SMS menus. Hopefully they have also fixed the idiotic bug where if you paused an MP3 that you were listening to and then someone called you, it would play the paused tune at full volume for the world to hear rather than the ringtone.

If you have an N70, [go get the upgrade](http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,8764,95599,00.html). If it doesn't want to upgrade you, call Voda and get the phone unlocked.

Sir Clive Sinclair R.I.P. - My Hero,"Sir Clive Sinclair died [on September 16th 2021](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/16/home-computing-pioneer-sir-clive-sinclair-dies-aged-81) after a long illness. I knew this had been coming for quite a while based on internet rumblings but it's still a shock to know that the man, whose brilliant mind changed the life of a small kid from rural Ireland, is gone.

![ZX81](/images/2021/09/sirclive_zx81_tv.png)

I've written many many many times over the years [on this blog](https://www.google.com/search?q=conoroneill.com%3A+sinclair) and on [my tech blog](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=conoroneill.net%3A+sinclair) about the ZX Spectrum and Sinclair in general. And I'm going to do it one more time.

I always refer to that school trip from St Kieran's College in Kilkenny to Dublin in late 1981 or early 1982 where one of my schoolmates brought me to the Grafton Arcade and into Tomorrow's World, the main computer shop at the time. I can't put into words how mind-blown I was. At this stage I think I'd only been near the Apple II in school. To be able to touch and play with real computers was the most exciting thing I'd ever encountered. 

Then I saw the ZX81 and it was love at first sight. In comparison to all the clunky behemoths with their clear 1970s heritage, here was something that was tiny and modern. And ""cheap"". I had to have one.

As always, I went deep and started buying the relevant magazines. But then something incredible happened. They announced the ZX Spectrum. A ZX81++, with colour and sound and movable keys! The ZX81 was soon forgotten and I badgered my parents for months until eventually, just before Christmas 1982, a co-worker of my Dad arrived back from the UK with a 16K Speccy from WH Smith.

![48k](/images/2021/09/48k.jpg)

And as I said above, my life changed forever. I'm not sure I buy into the idea that the ""you would have gone down this route anyway whether via Commodore or Acorn or Oric or Dragon or Amstrad"". Price was critical and it was always Sir Clive's best and worst motivation. £99 was manageable whereas even the Commodore 64 was out of reach. And one of the big differences between Speccies and the others was how easy/cheap it was to build your own electronics for them. Which eventually resulted in me doing Electronic Engineering rather than Computer Science. 

![Hey Hey 16k](/images/2021/09/hey_hey_16k.png)

I love having that appreciation of both hardware and software that I first got when I opened up my 16K Speccy and inserted a bunch of RAM chips to turn it into a 48K, followed later by an all-new keyboard/case.

![Electronics](/images/2021/09/electronics.jpg)

Sir Clive was a terrible businessman and flawed in so many ways. If there was a cheap way of doing things, he always picked that. Sometimes it resulted in perfection like the Spectrum. Other times it was a disaster like the Microdrives and C5. Even as a teen I could see he was making dreadful mistakes with things like the Interface 2 or QL. But it didn't matter, because he created the Spectrum.

The design of the original 16K and 48K was down to the genius of [Rick Dickinson](https://retromash.com/2018/04/27/rick-dickinson-zx-spectrum-designer-a-tribute/) and I think it still looks modern today, the way Braun designs do. In fact it looks a lot better than the Raspberry Pi 400, which is in many ways its spiritual successor rather than various modern retro devices. Read that article linked to Rick above to see his utter brilliance as a designer.

![Pi 400](/images/2021/09/pi400.jpg)

Last year in the depths of lockdown, I finally treated myself to an Amstrad-era 128K +2 so I could play newer (late 80s LOL) games but it just doesn't have the visual and emotional impact of the original.

![128k](/images/2021/09/128k.jpg)

I could write paragraph after paragraph about my 1982 Speccy, which still works perfectly and it now has an SD card adapter and HDMI out! 

I could write even more about the innovation that happened in the UK around the late 70s and early 80s leading to an ARM in every computing device.

But I think I'll spend today thinking about that brilliant man and his sometimes crazy ideas and how much I owe him for making me (and keeping me) excited about the potential for technology and people to do amazing things together.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I'll probably play Hey Hey 16K at least 5 or 10 times.

Sitting on the Dock of the Bay,"A last minute decision to pop down here for Sunday lunch turned out to be a total success. Fantastic seafood in a relaxed atmosphere with serene views of Clonakilty Bay. If they could just do something about parking, it would be perfect.

I've eaten in Deasy's once before and thoroughly enjoyed it. For some reason they popped into my head this morning and I hopped into the car with four of the five monsters to see if they were still doing Sunday Lunch. The usual crawl to Clon ensued followed by the twisty road to Ring.

I knew the parking had been bad but time had dulled my memory. It's brutal. Four spaces in front of the pub and then you have to travel a few hundred yards to find a roadside spot. Fine as an adult, a total pain (and dangerous) if you have kids. I had to circle three times before parking. Just in case, I ran down and discovered that they didn't open for lunch until 1\. So we headed over to the newly revamped playground in Clon. This looks great but now seems much more oriented towards older kids. My middle-uns were scared to climb the ladders to the slides.

Back we trotted to Ring and luckily one of the four spaces was free and we parked right at the door. It was still pretty quiet at 1pm but people arrived bit by bit over the following hour. We were seated towards the back which made sense from a safety perspective. The staff and owner were very friendly throughout. The lack of a baby-seat was a bit of a pain but not the end of the world. After seeing the usual stroppiness of our four demons, they gave us some crayons and colouring sheets which calmed everyone down.

The menu is a big step above what you'd expect from a rural Irish pub. The three course lunch menu is €30 and looks great value to me. However, as our family meals are all about speed, I went straight to the main courses. Initially I was concerned that there was nothing very child-friendly on the menu but then I copped myself on and realised they should be eating the same stuff as me.

So I ordered three half portions of Monkfish and Fennel Risotto with puttanesca salsa for them and a Hake with Lemon Butter and Swiss Chard for me. They arrived reasonably quickly on adult stopwatches but an eternity in kid-time. I tried to explain ""cooking on demand"" to the kids but failed.

Of course all them said ""yeuch, I'm not eating that"" as soon as the plates were put on the table. Rather than get hassled, I let them be and started on my hake. Never ones to miss an opportunity to annoy me, two of them asked to taste the hake and both decided they loved it, the little sods. I split mine between them and then took over their plates of risotto. Dishes of lovely baby spuds and one of the best selections of vegetables I've ever seen in an Irish restaurant appeared too.

Myself and the two middlers had a bit of everything. Baby would eat nothing. 2 year old wouldn't touch anything until near the end, at which point he let me feed him a mix of fish, risotto, carrots and spuds.

Oh, I nearly forgot to say, the food was fantastic. The fish perfectly cooked, the flavours subtle and not overpowering, the vegetables beautiful. Apologies for the lack of pics and menu details but I really had my hands full.

The two boys began messing too loudly so it was time to go. The bill for the food plus three 7-ups and a Ballygowan came to a refreshingly low €53\. We'll be back very soon avec wife and fifth child so I can sample more and have both hands available to eat with."
Six Go Mad in Macclesfield,"We finally bit the bullet and took a trip to Frank, Helen and the two boys in Macclesfield en famille. The six of us headed down to Cork airport last saturday morning bright and early. 

The Servisair genius at check-in put us in three separate rows. She was either as thick as two short planks or bitter over her fabulous career. Either way, Catherine had Fionn, I had Ois & Shibs and poor Oscar had to sit on his own for take-off. We managed to get on the plane without too much hassle. I'm sure there were plenty of dagger looks into the backs of our heads with people muttering ""did they have to bring alllll their children?"" and ""would they ever hurry the fuck up and sit down"". I know I do when I'm travelling alone.

We then realised the plane was half-empty so I was tempted to get off the plane and bitch-slap the cow at check-in. But the very nice BMI Baby ladies on the plane let us move around after take off. I think Osc was secretly delighted that he was in his own row, particularly when I told him that I was 14 before I flew anywhere.

The flight passed without incident apart from Oisín insisting he needed a slash as we were landing. They wouldn't let us move and I started seriously wondering how much urine the puke bags might take before bursting. But the wee star held on until the terminal.

We got a Corolla Verso which is very swish inside compared to the Zafira but a bit smaller so the bags were a squeeze. I had printed out AA route instructions door to door and headed off confident that the trip would take 30-40 minutes even if Catherine fulfills the ""women can't read maps or directions"" stereotype perfectly. 

As we approached the exit roundabout, we saw a sign for the first town we needed to get to, but when we reached the roundabout, it was nowhere to be found on any of the signs. Panic. Take wrong exit. U-Turn, take another exit, damn damn we're on a motorway, no fuck, I don't want to go to Birmingham, or poxing Sheffield, exit exit. OK, we're on the A34, that sounds familiar. Bugger, wrong direction, another U-Turn, sign for Wilmslow, hurrah my built-in compass managed to get us on the correct road  without having any clue what direction I was pointing in or where Macclesfield actually is.

Highlight of the car trip was seeing ""The Cock Inn"". Someday we'll get the opportunity to stop near there and ask someone ""How far is the cock inn?"". Yep, all the maturity of a 12 year old.

We then passed thorough Over Alderley, Upper Alderley, Nether Alderley, Mini-Alderley, Semi-Alderley, Under Alderley, High Alderley and Congleton (pronounced ""Maudelin""). About 1.5 hours later we arrived. We hadn't seen James since he was a squirt and he has turned into a strapping young 3-year old boy. We'd never  seen Mattie and he is a wee bundle of grins and took to us all like old friends.

Constant rain meant we couldn't really go anywhere but we were happy to hang out and catch up. Our monsters were happy to demolish the other kids playroom. Oisín thought he had died and gone to heaven when he saw the box full of Thomas trains.

The main thing that always strikes me about the UK is that all of the old bits are of such fabulous quality - the houses, the roads, the playgrounds, the parks. It's a pity the new bits from the 60's onwards all look so cheap and nasty.

A night of lovely food and booze ensued after a bracing walk in the lashing rain to a playground.

Conor woke up the following morning feeling like one of the children was jumping up and down on his head. In the voice of Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons ""Worst Hangover, ever"". Can I just offer my undying gratitude to the creator of Ponstan?

Helen stuffed us again with yum food and we headed off early afternoon. We made a half-arsed attempt to find Old Trafford and failed. We both got a tingle of fear/excitement when we saw a sign for Moss Side. Oooh, are we in a bad area? Ooh, scary pyjamas.

Of course the damned flight was delayed but our gang behaved quite well despite them not being able to understand how you could get a burger and not get a toy. We arrived back on Sunday around 10:30pm. Exhausted and kinda chuffed at how well it had all gone.

Big Thanks to the Manc Crew for putting up with us. Twas a brave offer to invite us over. We'll do it all again when they are in college."
Six Years a-Bloggin today!,"17th April 2001, I got an account on this thing I probably heard about on Slashdot called Blogger. I just saw it as an easier way of keeping my personal homepage (which I think I started in 1996 on Indigo) up-to-date.

How wrong I was. The second blog post was 7th August 2001.

For the first 4 years, the blog mainly consisted of baby announcements of my friends and my job situation. In 2005 I finally started doing it very regularly, moved to a Wordpress blog and now look at me. In the next 4 weeks I'll be [launching a business](http://www.loudervoice.com/) built on blogging.

I can't claim to have foreseen the profound impact that blogging would have in many areas. As with most things I get involved in, it just ""seemed like a good idea at the time"". I've been very lucky over the years that many of those ideas turned out to be genuinely good.

I've gone from one reader (Catherine) to several hundred per day. Thanks to all of you for stopping by and leaving comments. I hope I've written the odd useful thing and made you smile once or twice.

I encourage anyone who has ever felt like expressing an opinion to more than their mates down the pub to give blogging a try. It takes less than a minute to get a blog over at [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) and writing blog-posts is easier than sending an email. If it turns out you have no long-term interest, well you've probably wasted less time than your daily commute.

Here's to another six years of conoroneill.com

Cheers!"
Skyping with Bluetooth,"[Skype](http://www.skype.com) and Bluetooth are a match made in heaven. My home set-up is an Acer Laptop with a very nice [teeny Neon Bluetooth USB Adapter](http://www.shop4memory.com/memory/bluetooth-dongle.asp) which I got from [Shop4Memory](http://www.shop4memory.com/) in Celbridge. I also got the latest [GG Telecom](http://www.gg2002.com/) [GG03a Bluetooth headset](http://www.shop4memory.com/products/bluetooth-headset.asp) from them. This is Bluetooth 1.2 compatible, but more importantly can be paired to up to three devices. So with a quick button press, I can switch it from working with the Nokia mobile to pairing with the laptop to pairing with the work desktop. 

It's then a simple matter of telling Skype to use the Bluetooth as the Audio Input/Output device and you can now make Skype calls using the headset and wander (not too far!)  around the house.

I purchased €10 work of Skype-Out credit and was initially using some of it for the conference calls I make to the US when I'm working from home. But I suddenly realised that I could use the US toll-free numbers to dial-in to the conference calls from Skype. So these calls are now free! The quality can be patchy at times but is no worse than that from many of the people who dial-in using their mobiles.

As an experiment, I am going to try the same with [Gizmo ](http://www.gizmoproject.com/)to see if the quality is any better. It is a fully standards compliant VOIP tool but with many of the same bells and whistles as Skype. I prefer the idea of standards compliance rather than the proprietary lock-in of Skype. If I get a chance I'll try it today and report back.

If you do get the Neon Adapter (and I do recommend it), then make sure to install the latest [Blue Soleil Bluetooth stack from IVT](http://www.ivtcorporation.com/products/bluesuit/index.php), as the older ones which ship with the adapter don't work well with the Nokia PC Suite.

SMALL UPDATE: I bought $10 credit on Gizmo so I could test the performance connecting to POTS. Unfortunately the planned conf call was cancelled. But I dialled into the US Conference Center number anyway. Initial impression was that the voice quality I was hearing was better than Skype. Also, I often get failures in Skype with keying the conference passwords - the DTMF must get overly-distorted. I had no issue with Gizmo. So looking good overall. Next test is to find out from others how I sound on it and to see if they do free calls to US toll-free POTS numbers like Skype.

UPDATE 2: I'm in the international departures lounge in Logan. Customer needed to talk to me ASAP and I didn't want to use the mobile, so I chanced Gizmo. It worked like a charm. I didn't have the headset set-up so I was talking at the tiny built-in mic on the laptop and used my normal walkman-style headphones to listen to him. I asked him how the quality was and he thought it was fine. Particularly impressive when you consider the level of background noise and the constant tannoy announcements (Some poor announcer sap actually said ""Mr Goldfinger please contact the SwissAir check-in desk""! Check it out.

Slight colour blindness,"This would be funny if over 2000 people hadn't been murdered by terrorists in the past thirty five years on this island.

I was just reading the latest edition of my local Bandon Opinion and saw an ad by Sinn Fein Bandon encouraging people to wear the Easter Lily.

Let me just quote the important bit: ""combining the green, white and saffron of our national flag"". Green......White.....SAFFRON? Which national flag are these cretins referring to? That of Tuvalu maybe or Micronesia or maybe Latvia?

Obviously Sinn Fein is now run by middle class foodies who like nothing better than a delicate saffron flavoured risotto.

Just when you think they are getting a clue, you are reminded of what you are dealing with.

Slow Food Cork City Spring Supper and Slow Film,"I found out about this movie/grub combo that is on next Tuesday (28th) on [The Slow Food Ireland](http://www.slowfoodireland.com/events-page23713.html) web-site. Clodagh McKenna describes it as follows:
> A showing of the new Irish film 'Short Order' in the Kino cinema, Cork at 7pm and following the film a spring supper at Cafe Paradiso at 9.30pm (there will be a half an hour gap so you can have a drink at Reidy's bar)
> Short Order is a new film from Irish director Anthony Byrne. A colourful, tongue-in-cheek surreal musical-comedy, starring Emma de Caunes, Jack Dee, Paul Kaye, John Hurt and Vanessa Redgrave. It’s a magical night in the lives of our protagonists: Short Order Chefs, Masterchefs, Delivery People, working out their philosophies between bites of honest to goodness, onions, garlic, lemon and rum drenched prawns, house special Osso Bucco (featuring the freshly chopped fingers of Bill Dodging Customers). A little bit of life, love and wisdom come together over one night in the culinary underbelly where life is a buffet and everything is short order.
> Please note that tickets for the cinema have to be purchased through the kino 021 427 1571 and tickets for the supper through cafe paradiso 021 427 7939\. Tickets for the supper are only available for cinema ticket holders and supper tickets are limited.  Cost: Film - €8, Supper - €35 (this includes a glass of organic wine)
I booked for myself and Catherine earlier. There was a wee bit of confusion about how/where you book but I think it is like this: The Kino does not accept Credit Card bookings on the phone but if you only want to see the movie then deal with them exclusively.

If you want the movie and the meal, then ring Cafe Paradiso and they will let you pay in advance for both the meal and the tickets. You still have to pop in at some point to get the tickets. When I was booking this afternoon, they had 15 people booked for food out of a max of 35 so get your skates on if you are interested.

Small AllFreeCalls problem,"I decided to try out [AllFreeCalls.ie](http://AllFreeCalls.ie) this afternoon. I had to ring Casio Customer Support in the UK about my poxy unfixable watch and my guess was that it would a longish call. I rang the access number and a voice told me that I would be charged at local rates and to enter the number I wanted. I entered the UK number and got through to the queuing system in Casio immediately. I did notice a reasonable amount of noise on the line which I assume is a VOIP artifact. I was asked to press ""2"" on my phone which I did, repeatedly, to no avail.

I hung up and re-rang the number using [Gizmo](http://www.gizmoproject.com/) (I have Call Out credit) and this time my keypress worked fine. So it looks like the DTMF tones are getting sufficiently distorted that they don't work on AllFreeCalls.

Not a huge deal and it will affect very few people. And still a sweet service.

A question popped up today when my wife had to ring her sister in the US. The sister was on an Irish mobile. Just wondering if [a] AllFreeCalls can handle that scenario and [b] how much the call would cost both parties? A perfect candidate for [Roam4Free](http://www.roam4free.ie/) but she has a company mobile.

And no, the Casio people still couldn't sort out my dodgy watch. Grrrr."

I generally don't make New Years Resolutions but this years is fairly simple - this blog will actually have posts on it about Bandon itself over the coming months. There are a ton of interesting things happening here and the place has changed hugely since we arrived 2.5 short years ago. It's about time the place was given a bit of good PR.

Smooth n Easy Upgrade to Wordpress 2.0 and Connections Reloaded,"If anyone who worked for me ever attempted a double simultaneous software upgrade, I'd fire them. But as I'm the boss of me, I can do whatever I like on my blog. Last night I upgraded the blogging software to [Wordpress 2.0](http://www.wordpress.org/) and moved the Blog Theme from [Connections](http://vanillamist.com/blog/?page_id=64) to [Connections Reloaded](http://www.ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/wpthemes/connections-reloaded/). Huge kudos to Matt and Donncha and all the others at Wordpress for the trouble free upgrade and to Ajay for doing such a slick improvement to Connections.

AS far as plugins go, I had varying degress of success. I dumped the [""Recent Posts""](http://www.semiologic.com/software/recent-posts/) plugin as I never liked the way it presented the data. If anyone misses it, let me know. I tried the [""Live Calendar""](http://www.jonabad.com/livecalendar/) plugin which is very slick except it does not seem to work when the blog is installed in a sub-directory, so I disabled it until I can figure that out. I am about to install the [""Postie""](http://www.economysizegeek.com/?page_id=395) plugin upgrade which allows me to send pictures to the blog via email (and therefore directly from my phone). The older one worked well in test but I never used it in anger. The [""WP-DB-Backup](http://www.skippy.net/blog/category/wordpress/plugins/wp-db-backup/)[""](http://www.skippy.net/blog/category/wordpress/plugins/wp-db-backup/) plug-in continues to work like a charm. The [""Simple Tags""](http://www.broobles.com/scripts/simpletags/) plug-in needs database changes to work on WP 2.0 so I'll leave that until I have a bit more time.The [""Subscribe to Comments""](http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/) plugin worked without change.

One thing I am very interested in trying is the [""Structured Blogging""](http://structuredblogging.org/resources.php) plugin. I'd love to do my reviews in a structured way without going totally overboard and losing the ""make it up as I go along"" aspect of my reviews. But the site for it is pretty poor and it is not clear if WP 2.0 is supported and I'm not going to waste my time trying in case it isn't.

The [Archives](http://conoroneill.com/archive-index/) page now works ok if you want a nice way to browse old posts.

I have also started a [Links](http://conoroneill.com/links/) page. Currently there are four:

[Bandon Parish](http://www.bandonparish.ie/) - Run by the local Catholic church but with tons of general non-religious info and a great resource.
[Bandon 400](http://www.bandon.ie/) - Set-up to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the town last year. Should be the main portal for the town but appears not to be given much love and attention
[Scoil Bhride Crossmahon](http://www.crossmahonns.com/) -  Best National School in the area
[Kilbrogan House](http://www.kilbrogan.com/) - A fine looking B&B. A great resource with info and links about the locality.

If you find any problems with the site changes, please add a comment."

SOHO SOLO Ireland,"I gave a talk today about blogging to the West Cork [Soho Solo](http://www.sohosoloireland.com/) Networking Meeting in Clonakilty. I previous gave the same one to the East Cork group. It was very well received and I hope we see a few new blogs coming from them. If you are not aware of Soho Solo, it is a very worthwhile project. As their site says:

> The aims of the project are to identify Small Office Home Office Workers(Soho Solos) in the South West of Ireland, to encourage others to relocate or return to the region, to promote Small Office Home Office Working and to offer support to these ""new"" entrepreneurs.

If you fit that description, I would highly recommend you contact them as they offer great support for what can be a very solitary endeavour.

Sometimes the customer is an idiot,"Our 9 year old tv has gone on the blink. It was a great 32"" Philips Matchline job whose only drawback was that it wasn't widescreen. We started on the hunt for a replacement on Saturday. Tried Soundstore, Harvey Norman, Xtravision, O'Dwyer's and a few online places. 

Result? It is nearly impossible to get a high-end 32"" CRT TV any more. Philips, JVC, Panasonic and Sony have a tiny selection of wide-screen boxes with less functionality than four years ago.

The buying public have decided that they would prefer to pay triple the money for an LCD thing with a narrow viewing angle, awful reflections, crap black and rubbish brightness. Why do I feel like the record fanatics in the 1980s who tried to hold back the CD tide? I guess I am not part of the iPod generation which values form over function; ""who cares what it does or how much it costs, it's sooooo cute"".

Bah. I also have to make the horrible admission that I am seriously considering a Samsung TV. Has the world gone mad? Next thing I'll find myself buying a <strike>Daewoo</strike> Chevrolet car. Neverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

Granny Mary was down for a few days and was a wee star to mind the bairns whilst we went out for a quick bite. We both had a hunger on us for steaks and headed towards Paidrigín's which we have never eaten in. They were full. So we tried Broly's to discover that their night-time offering had not lasted and they were shut (a big pity, I really liked what they did). We were flummoxed until I suddenly realised that Sorrento's, the Italian place smack bang in the middle of Bandon, probably did steaks too.

We ate there once over two years ago and were not really impressed but they went under new managment and I have heard some good things in the comments on this blog about it. The menu in the window confirmed a decent selection of steaks.

They were reasonably busy but not full so we got a table. The menu was pretty standard Irish-Italian  fare with Spag Bol, Lasagne etc but they also had a fine looking selection of pizzas, good specials and the steak list really did look good. 

To start, Catherine had what was described as foccacia but was actually a hard dough base with tomato etc on top. She didn't think it was very good. Throughout the entire meal, there were people collecting pizzas, so we must check them out with the kids the next time.

I went with the same thing that I always do in an Italian, Antipasta Misto. It was good with salami, parma, chorizo, sun-dried toms, artichokes and these really tasty little preserved mushrooms which I have never had before. It came with a bunch of frissee/rocket type salad which was undressed since they had that old-fashioned (but should have a revival) oil/vinegar combo on the table. Only criticism would be that I'd drop the chorizo for something like bresaola or another italian salami.

Catherine changed her mind on the steak and plumped for the creamy monkfish special. I got the Gorgonzola steak. Whilst we were waiting we eyeballed the plates going to all the other tables. Big portions of tasty looking nosh. Ours arrived and were equally big.

The steak came with some baby spuds, more of that salad, a nice ratatouille-style veg mix and the sauce which wasn't as ""blue"" tasting as I expected. But the steak, holy cow the steak. I think maybe one of the best I have had in the past year. No joke. A big chewy blood-dripping hunk of cow. Absolutely perfectly cooked. I had asked for sirloin in preference to fillet but I think it might have been rump which is a much tastier cut. The menu said it came from a local craft butcher so it was probably either from Dan or Martin and both of them do really great beef. I relished every mouthful.

Catherine's monkfish was fine but not great. The monkfish had been cut up small rather than being done either as medallions or as one piece. The sauce was a bit heavy too. She did polish it off tho.

We went for the old reliables Tiramisu and Panna Cotta for dessert both of which were good. Two double espressos finished the whole thing nicely.

All through the service was friendly and attentive but not in our faces. I had a glass of house red which was spot-on and the sparkling water was San Pellegrino which I like.

Total came to €78 which is pricey for a local place. If it had come in under €70, I'd have been happier. But the reality is that the steak I had last night beat the one given to a dining partner in Isaac's during the week and you'll find Isaac's in most food guides. The Sorrento's one was cheaper, bigger and far better cooked.

This is a local restaurant doing unpretentious, tasty meals with solid ingredients. If you are in Bandon and feel like a decent plate of food, go have a look.

Spicendipity goes live!,"Many of the readers of this blog are surely also fans of [The Humble Housewife](http://tast.ie/), Deborah Hadley. She has just launched a fabulous new web-site called [Spicendipity](http://spicendipity.com/) selling homemade sauces and 100% natural spice mixes and baking mixes.

![](http://spicendipity.com/images/logo.png)

Debz had me won over just by saying ""BBQ sauce"" when she first revealed what she was putting together. We love the idea so much, the prize we are giving away on LouderVoice for the best review at Taste of Cork is one of her [BBQ Hampers](http://spicendipity.com/proddetail.php?prod=bbqgiftandcat=8). This little beauty contains:

*   Two bottles of her signature Two Brew BBQ Sauce to slather your chicken, ribs, or steak
*   One Italian Seasoning Mix, perfect for dips and marinades
*   One Tex Mex Spice Mix, ideal for spicy dips and meat rubs
*   One Beer Bread Mix for the perfect accompaniment to your meal
*   One Brownie Mix for the perfect ending
*   A BBQ cookery book, grill tongs, bamboo skewers and a tea towel to mop it all up with.
You can visit the site right now but it doesn't officially launch until tomorrow. Get those orders in!

p.s. another fab site design by [Sabrina Dent](http://www.sabrinadent.com/) too."
Spongebob The Lobster,"I finally did it - down to Union Hall with all four of the darlings and we bought a lobster. Poor Ois nearly had a heart attack when the guy in the shop leaped towards him with the lobster in his hand! Oscar just wanted to know how I was going to kill it. That kid worries me sometimes.

So here he is, just home, Spongebob.

Overnighted in the fridge covered in wet newspaper. Into the freezer for 2 hours and then straight into boiling, heavily salted water as per Sophie Grigson.

Also made my first ever mayonnaise. It split and I put too much oil in it. But other than that it was perfect ;-)

The lobster wasn't great to be honest. Very disappointing - tiny amount of meat which was a bit stringy and didn't have much flavour. Not worth €19\. Back to crab.

And now for the bridge I mentioned recently. No it is not a pedestrian bridge and yes that is a van coming towards me:

Spoofer of the year award,"Just spotted this over at [Alex Barnett's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/05/14/597452.aspx). His Dad sent him [a link to some video footage](http://img.dailymail.co.uk/video/cabbie.wmv). I have tears rolling down my face.

> See link below for a glorious, hilarious mess-up by the BBC. A producer rushed to the reception area and mistakenly took a mini-cab driver to be a interviewed live on BBC 24 news as an ""expert"" on the internet about the Apple case. [There is a video link](http://img.dailymail.co.uk/video/cabbie.wmv) - see the hilarious expression at the beginning on the cabbies face when he realizes it was a case of mistaken ID - he then bluffs his way brilliantly through the interview.

I'd love to have this guys ability to think on his feet. What's even better is that it was supposed to be Guy Kewney, one of the most famous computer journalists in the UK. He's a tall white guy with a beard!

Still playing with Wordpress themes,Haven't found anything I'm entirely happy with yet. Any opinions on this one?
Stormhoek not quite stonking but pretty damned good,"My bottle of [Stormhoek Sauvignon Blanc 2005](http://www.stormhoek.com/) from the [gapingvoid freebie](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001646.html) arrived by courier this evening. I was going to wait until tomorrow to review but one dead linux server has fast-tracked the opening.

[![IMG_1454](http://static.flickr.com/29/43079659_2ba40ab4f7_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/43079659/ ""Photo Sharing"")

It uses a screw-cap which I support 100% for Sauvignons. I am sick to the back teeth of getting ruined bottles of Sancerre and Pouilly Fumé with their crappy corks.

On opening, a bit of a sniff tells me that it is along the same lines as other South African Sauvignons and not like the Marlborough ones. So it's pleasant but without the nose punch you get off a Villa Maria.

A few mouthfuls and I am well happy. Very decent wine. I am no Jilly or Oz, so comparisons to cut grass or mongolian ecky-ecky ftang flowers shall have to be left to others who are more knowledgeable. This is the type of wine I put in the eminently quaffable category. It's not blow-my-socks off fantastic but it beats all Chilean Sauvignons I have drunk in the past two years. Besting the Chilean giants at their own game is something to be proud of. It is also the best South African Sauvignon I have tried to date.

Negative points? A bit thin and lacking in depth so maybe not brilliant for skulling back whilst watching Green Wing on a friday night but an absolutely perfect partner for food. 

I'd love to know what the price point for this is. Most of the Chilean/South African Sauvignons come in at €10 to €12 in Ireland. The New Zealand ones are more €12 to €16 (apart from over-rated Cloudy Bay at €26). If this is at the same level as it's peers then I think Stormhoek will have a very strong seller on their hands. 

You Orbital boys have a distie yet in Ireland? Maybe it is time for me to diversify [the company](http://www.argolon.com/) into wine.

Now back to deciphering the arcane mysteries of fsck with two glasses of wine inside me.

UPDATE: I am an ungrateful pup. At no point above did I say thanks to Stormhoek, Orbital and Hugh for the lovely bottle of free wine. Thanks all.

Structured Blogging Event Aggregation,"I spent quite a few hours last night working through many of the Event/Calendar sites on the web to see if any of them supported the automated collection of events from blogs which use the hCalendar format in structured blog posts. So far I have found tons of discussion but no actual implementation. Does anyone out there know of a site which does this (or know of one under development)?

The ones I checked were:

[Upcoming](http://www.upcoming.org/): I see quite a few mentions of Upcoming in this context but nothing obvious on the site
[Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/): Nothing at all
[Zvents](http://www.zvents.com/): Ditto but looks like it might be a fit
[OpenEvents](http://www.openevents.com/): Pay only so couldn't find out
[Eventful](http://eventful.com/): They mention it on the site as coming so fingers crossed.

[Evite](http://www.evite.com/): Doesn't look like a good fit.
[WhizSpark](http://www.whizspark.com/): Pay only so couldn't find out
[30 Boxes](http://30boxes.com/): Might be a good match too but didn't see anything about it.

Structured Blogging Plug-in Review,"<div class='hreview'>   <div>

How about this for a bit of recursion - I am reviewing the Structured Blogging Plug-in for Wordpress using the Structured Blogging Plug-in. I think the basic idea of it should suit a lot of the posts on this blog which tend to be reviews. 

Installation was a breeze and it seems to play ok with WP2.0.

Criticisms so far? 

[1] It seems to slow down the load of the ""writing page"" by an enormous amount. 
[2] The simple Star Rating system for reviews is a bit limiting. Most people want to give a range of scores for different aspects of things - acting/directing/cinematography for movies and food/service/ambiance/value for restaurants. Don't even think about getting AA Gill started on the topic of star ratings. And most wino's, ahem, wine experts, would faint at the thought of a star system for wines.
[3] Where the hell have the rich text editing controls from WP2.0 gone? Actually I hate them but the plug-in seems to even had got rid of the simple controls (what the hell is the html for strikethrough again?)

After a bit more testing, I'll probably use it when appropriate. Feedback appreciated.

In the original draft of this posting, I used the ""Tags"" feature of the plug-in. Don't bother as it does not create hyperlinks over to those tags on Technorati. So the tags below were done (as always) by the great [SimpleTags plug-in](http://www.broobles.com/scripts/simpletags/).

StructuredBlogging.org site re-launched,"The totally revamped [StructuredBlogging.org](http://www.structuredblogging.org/) site has gone live. [Richard MacManus](http://www.readwriteweb.com/) and the gang have done a tremendous job and I think it is now communicating the whole idea in a far more effective way than it did in the past. They explain it far better than I can here so go and have a read.

If you read this blog regularly, you will have noticed some posts which appear to have more structure than others (mainly my reviews and event notifications). It takes no extra effort for me to do the posts in that form and in fact, in some ways, makes it a lot easier. So even if there was no other upside than making reviews easier to write, I would be happy to make use of the Structured Blogging software.

But the long term aim of the effort is to enable new web-sites and services which can make use of that extra structure and create systems we haven't even dreamt about yet. This is one of those efforts which is very dependent on average bloggers like me generating the content in the first place so I am happy to do my little bit and get my own benefits too.

Richard very kindly mentioned me in [his announcement of the re-vamp](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/structured_blog_1.php), but to be honest I did very little and should have helped more. Also, I have been very remiss in not following up on the structured recipe ideas which was tossed around recently. Unfortunately a new work location with a shockin' commute is chewing up a lot of my time (and the garden is in a brutal state!). I really do want to get started on this again as there is already discussion on the microformats site about [a recipe microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/recipe-examples) to which I should contribute.

If you have a Moveable Type or Wordpress Blog (not wordpress.com), I really really encourage you to install the [Structured Blogging plug-in](http://www.structuredblogging.org/) and play with it. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by its utility. And once some of those new services start being rolled out, you'll find yourself wayyyy ahead of the game!

If you are interested in some of the ideas on where Marc Canter thinks this is all going, [have a read of the roadmap](http://www.structuredblogging.org/roadmap.php).

The Pubsub guys who do a lot of the work on structured blogging have [their own announcement here](http://sandbox.pubsub.com/blog/?p=53).

Also, if you wonder about the importance of microformats which underpin structured blogging, well a certain [Bill G is a fan](http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/03/we-need-microformats-bill-gates).

Finally, Bob Wyman of Pubsub [has a superb post](http://bobwyman.pubsub.com/main/2006/04/edgio_open_crai.html) on the open web vs the closed web and how structured blogging is part of the open revolution. In fact there are many compelling arguments being made on the structured blogging mailing list which I wish were being re-published by their authors on their blogs.

Support Action Breast Cancer Fundraiser,"One of the most powerful blogs I read in recent years was Roos Demol's [One Breast Less](http://onebreastlessinireland.blogspot.com/). I'm thrilled she has re-started it and she is involved in an Action Breast Cancer fundraiser.

Please head over there and show your support.

Support Action Breast Cancer,"I should have posted this weeks ago but I've been a wee bit busy. Our friends Haydn and Roos let me know about an event that is on October 29th in The Brogan Inn from 8pm to 10pm.

""It Must be the Music"" is a night of Musical entertainment in aid of Action Breast Cancer, brought to you by Laoise O'Hanlon, joined by a variety of Cork women singers, including Kay Deering, Jamie Harper Kingston, Roos Demol, Bernie Harrington, Sinead Tracey, Jenny Bradley and Molly Lynch.

The accompanist is Deirdre Long and the MC is Ciarán Bermingham

Tickets are only €15 and are available from Roos on 086-8508548 or An Tobairín on South Main Street, Bandon.

Lots of discussion about it [over on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=161806457163827) if you want to know more."
Support KildareStreet.com if you care about democracy,"Most people in this country seem happy enough to have it run by [imbeciles](http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1102/308186-finance/) and [criminals](http://www.moriarty-tribunal.ie/), so it’s a relief that some people actually care.

The [official web-site](http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/) which holds the records of the Oireachtas is the kind of incompetent mess that can only have been designed to be that way on purpose. Luckily John Handelaar built [KildareStreet.com](http://KildareStreet.com) a few years ago to shine a light on the goings-on in the Dáil and Seanad. Not only does it contain all of the records but it lets you request things like “email me when the clown I voted for actually speaks in the Dáil”

![KildareStreet](https://www.kildarestreet.com/images/kildarestreetcom.gif)

Sir Humphrey and his minions made a concerted effort to kill KildareStreet a while back by changing all of their data formats, but they underestimated Mr Handelaar and it is still going strong.

You might not think this is an important resource until the day it’s gone. We live in a country where the insiders rely on a compliant uninformed populus and a complicit media. It’s scary how critical KildareStreet.com is to our inept democracy. A tiny glimmer of hope in this third-world banana republic.

But John and Sabrina can’t afford to run this out of [the goodness of their hearts](https://medium.com/@sabrinadent/an-open-letter-to-stephanie-lord-who-is-gutted-about-kildarestreet-com-22a37aaaf148). So go now to [donorbox.org](https://donorbox.org/kildarestreet) and vote with your wallet."
Sushi Saturday,"8 years after I first bought a tube of wasabi to make sushi, I finally managed to get everything in one place and made my first ever batch. I followed the instructions in ""[Rachel's Favourite Food for Friends](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0717139999/qid=1145733210/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_3_2/203-0253879-1863917)"". It turned out damned tasty but not exactly pretty. I'm sure sushi experts would cry over my efforts. Some pictures below. In case you are wondering, the kids medicine syringe was to measure out 30ml of rice vinegar. I wasn't in the scouts for most of my youth for nothing!

One question - why does the seaweed smell of fish?

Sustainably Slow Event on July 28th,"Anthony and the gang in [Ummera](http://www.ummera.com/) are hosting a Slow Food Event on the 28th. All the details over [at their blog](http://www.ummera.com/wordpress/?p=80). In a nutshell:

> There will be a number of small artisan producers displaying, tasting and selling their products. There will also be several organisations and companies who are involved in matters of a sustainable nature, solar panels, wetland construction, vermicomposting, permaculture, wind and hydro power.

Well worth a trip down to a beautiful location and a fabulous building."
Sweeeeettttttttt Caroline,"I raced back to Bandon from Ballymaloe, jumped into the interview suit, thanked Mary and Claire for risking their mental health by minding our four for two days and shot off with wife riding shotgun to Killarney. The Cork-Killarney road is now my most hated road in the country. 30 mph from Crookstown to a few miles outside Ballyvourney.

We arrived about 30 minutes before the meal was due to start. Caroline was looking fantastic. Not for nothing that she had most of the Class of 1990 UCD Elec Eng competing for her attention way back when. None of us are bitter that she married a teacher and part-time rock star, no not a bit, not a jot. Dave himself looked pretty damned delish - even to a confirmed heterosexual like myself.

This picture shows the bride in full flight.Take it from me that Dave looks just as good from the front.

[![IMG_1570](http://static.flickr.com/33/55579947_85eab7b68c_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/55579947/ ""Photo Sharing"")

We are now at that age where we only see batches of the old gang at weddings and special occasions. Caroline had gathered a fine selection of engineering misfits and their partners and we got on to our usual topics as if we had seen each other only yesterday.

As the wedding started so early, most people were well-on by the time we arrived. My awesome capability for alcohol meant that I had caught up after a pint.

I had been talking to Claire, Dee, Paul, Brian, Conor and Maria before I finally refocused to realise that the room we were in had one fantastic view. I only managed to get a picture of it on Monday in lashing rain but it is still pretty wonderful:

[![IMG_1576](http://static.flickr.com/25/55580498_2180f45395_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/55580498/ ""Photo Sharing"")

The meal was spot-on, the cake was fab and I loved the wine. I was too bloated to move after that.

First picture is of the final two contestants in the Bernard Manning Lookalike contest (with Paul there for scale):

The entertainment then began and the band turned out to be the best damned wedding band of all time. I am not bloody joking. The lead singer looked like Jennifer Ellison and absolutely nailed ""River Deep, Mountain High"". I did not want them to stop. I forced Wifey up for a few dances but sadly my belly gave severe head injuries to several small children and the dance floor had to be evacuated.

We had a great old catch-up session and realised that the men are all still as immature as we were in Ios when we put laxatives in Tom's cocktails and shaved Paul's legs. The women folk are just lucky to have us :-)

Maria tells Conor-Dub that he was always her favourite Conor.

Jill tries to give Conor a hug and convince him that he doesn't need to lose weight. Her arms won't fit around.

That picture causes Conor to go on the GI diet and give up drink until Christmas. Starting tomorow, I swear.......

D'Wife faded at around midnight and I started getting dopey around 1am. I looked around and Paul was asleep in a chair, Brian was gone (presumably to bed), Conor-Dub ditto, so I hit the sack. Turns out the boys were only re-charging their batteries and kept going until 5am! I missed the singing session and the DJ. I could say that they make me feel old but I've always loved my bed. My sources (Maria) tell me that Caroline and Dave also headed to bed around 5, but not before Caroline had asked Maria if she could borrow her ""OK"" magazine. Hot stuff in the wedding suite alright.

The following morning, we grabbed breakfast around 10am and they all started apearing just as breakfast ended. I felt grand, Conor-Dub looked like he was still drunk and Brian appeared not to have slept at all. So a successful wedding by all measures.

It looks like we are nearly out of weddings now. A few stragglers left (Mark, Mark, calling Mark). We could try and badger Quigs and Lolly but I don't think they are for turning. So next thing will be the 40ths and then (oh, it pains me to even think it), the 20 year reunion.

So Caroline and Dave - well done, we're chuffed you finally did the deed. Enjoy Prague and then enjoy Bishopstown even more.

The excess of booze means I took only a tiny few photos. They are all in the [Flickr Photo Set of the Wedding here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/sets/1203847/). If anyone has other pictures of the day that they want to share, feel free to mail them to me and I'll add them to the set.

UPDATE 1: Maria has sent on a bunch of much higher quality pictures. They are in the Flickr photo-set now too.

Systematic Evil,"I can't bear to read the report. It sickens me to think what those evil scum covered up over the years.

I'm not a religious person but I take some comfort in imagining everyone involved in the systematic abuse of children in the 20th century burning in the eternal fires of hell.

Some comfort in imagining every priest, every brother, every nun, every bishop, every arch-bishop, every cardinal, every papal nuncio, every pope who knew anything about what was happening in this country and DID NOTHING, being raped by satan every day for eternity.

The [Catholic Church in Ireland](http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/) should have all of their lands seized immediately, held by NAMA and sold off when the economy recovers. That money should be ring-fenced to build the best system in the world to take care of children in need in Ireland."
Tapenade Bistro on N7/N8,"This newish place is in the Midway FoodCourt, Portlaoise and is nearly successful in its attempt to do something a bit different.

I had to drive up to Dublin recently (having become over-used to the train) and stopped at Midway on the N7/N8 interchange to grab something to eat. I had spotted a newish place in there the last time I'd stopped for coffee and I thought I'd give it a try. They call it a ""healthy bistro"" which may actually put a lot of people off since there is plenty of ""normal"" stuff to eat.

[![Tapenade Bistro Midway](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2188/2097587794_8c781a5cb6_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2097587794/ ""Tapenade Bistro Midway by bandon1, on Flickr"")

The main things that they serve are three hot dishes, lots of salads and a variety of drinks including smoothies. Unfortunately the hot dishes did not look appetizing at all. They had meatballs in tomato sauce, sausages in gravy and burgers in gravy sitting in standard catering kitchen bain-marie trays. But they also had rice and mashed potatoes in the same setup. All looked untouched for hours. Having said that, the meatballs sounded nice so I went with that. No pasta, so I picked rice.

With that you get two salads and I went for a carrot one and a potato one. I also ordered a raspberry and mint smoothie and a latte. €18.50 all in.

[![Meatballs and Salads](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2097588018_e5365e4c92_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2097588018/ ""Meatballs and Salads by bandon1, on Flickr"")

The meatball and sauce was very nice (not as good as my own obviously :-) ) but as expected the rice was a dried up horror. The salads were extremely good and the smoothie was genuinely the best I have ever had. The background taste of mint was just perfect. Decent machine-based latte.

They could easily fix the carb problem by doing what I do at home. Cook up the rice (or pasta), drain and then run under an ice cold tap for several minutes until all heat is removed. Then when person orders (or kids arrive in), you pour boiling water over a portion in a sieve. No more claggy, shrivelled up, dried up carbs. I know there is a danger if you don't do it properly with rice but it's never been a problem for us.

This place really is a good idea. I still query the ""healthy"" marketing given the target audience and they have to fix the way they do carbs. I hope it succeeds because I'd happily make it my default stop on the Cork-Dublin route.

Taste of Cork a huge success,"We've been looking forward to this for months and it did not disappoint. An overwhelming success for the organisers and the exhibitors. We had a fantastic few hours last night, sampling and chatting. Go!

Whilst the reports on this year's Dublin Event varied, we had a strong belief that Cork would be good simply due to the smaller scale. Auntie Fi babysat the kiddies and we drove in to County Hall for 5.30 on the Friday evening. There was some confusion over buses but we got there quite quickly (you could just as easily walk to be honest).

[![LouderVoice at Taste Of Cork 2008](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3192/2617452975_30f8828c4c_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2617452975/ ""LouderVoice at Taste Of Cork 2008 by bandon1, on Flickr"")

I've never been in the City Gaol. Amazing! What a fantastic site and building. We're definitely going to be back for a tour with the kids soon. The place was hopping even at 5.45 and we immediately took a quick recce to see where everything was.

Our first port of call was Bubble Brothers and we chatted with Austin and Christopher. They had the LouderVoice review wine collars in prime position which was fantastic. We kicked off with a Brightwater Sauvignon and I think I had a sparkling Rose which was top notch.

[![Bubble Brothers Sign](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/2618291096_1d20e22eed_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2618291096/ ""Bubble Brothers Sign by bandon1, on Flickr"")

Right next door was Kay O'Connell's fish and we got a small pack of their sushi which was fabulous. They were all part of a large stand containing all the English Market vendors. The legendary olive stand was there too. Yummmm.

[![Kay O](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3110/2617470383_5ae6ac01d4_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/2617470383/ ""Kay O"")

We then just bounced from stall to stall trying samples of this and that, sipping on wine and just relaxing. The crowds did start to build and some things, particularly the demo tents and wine tasting became too full so we avoided them.

We ran into the wonderful Debz and Mr Debz of Spicendipity fame and had a fun time wandering around with them. Debz recommended some sausages and satay that she had tried.

The Woodford and Bourne wine tasting seemed to be of Torres which seemed a bit pointless as surely your local Esso garage has the full set? There were also a few stands which were just there for the sake of it rather than it providing much benefit to them or us e.g. SuperValu, Denny(!), Tropicana, Lindt. I was initially excited that Innocent Smoothies were there but it was just the usual dolly-birds handing out samples.

Some of the other highlights for me were Glenilen Farm and their mousse/cheesecake, Urru with their amazing cakes, Jane Russell's sausages, Arbutus duck rillettes and fois gras and many of the wine stands.

We realised we hadn't really had anything substantial to eat and headed over to the ""meal"" area. Earlier we'd had the Fenn Quay souffle and beetroot which didn't look great but tasted wonderful. Unfortunately when we arrived back, there were massive queues for them, Ivory Tower and Ballymaloe House. We gave up and headed back to O'Connell's for more sushi expecting it to be quite. Boy were we wrong. Totally mobbed! I queued for what felt like half an hour and got more fab sushi and some beautiful oysters.

We got to 9.20 and they were no longer selling the florin vouchers you use to buy all the nibbles, so off we trotted home.

My guess is that there are still plenty of tickets available for today and tomorrow due to people's concern about the weather. You'll meet some lovely exhibitors, eat some great food and have a few drinks. Not the cheapest few hours you'll spend, but worth it once a year.

I've got some videos [here on Qik](http://qik.com/videos/public_search?query=taste+of+cork) (pretty low quality)

TB Hospitals in Ireland,"I made a quick mention of the old TB hospitals [in a blog post](http://conoroneill.com/2007/03/28/five-children-have-tb-in-that-creche/) about BCG almost two years ago. As far as I know there were lots of them. Peamount, which we drove past many times, opened in 1912 and there was also Cappagh and others.

I just got a lovely email from someone who was in such a hospital in the 1950s wondering if I'd got any feedback. Unfortunately I hadn't. So I thought I'd just pop this up with the aim to allow anyone to give their thoughts, reminiscences etc of these places. Good and bad. Feel free to pass on to anyone you know who had TB back then. Of course commenters can remain anonymous/pseudonymous."
TCB Baby - Taking Care of Business,"I finally got to see [Bubba Ho-Tep](http://www.bubbahotep.com/) recently. What an odd but completely beguiling movie.

I sat down to watch it with a bunch of pre-conceptions and expectations. A low-budget ($500K) movie starring Bruce Campbell as Elvis and Ossie Davis as JFK fighting a mummy in an Old Folk's home in East Texas - how could you not have ideas as to what sort of movie it would be? I spent a summer in Stuttgart during college working in an old folk's home. Most of them thought they were Leni Riefenstahl or Field Marshall Goering.

From the first frame I knew I had it all wrong. The plot moved forward extremely slowly, action was minimal, the movie was very short, much of it was a voice-over and the horror was totally non-horrific. Enough normally to make me hate it (I think it's why I cannot watch 99% of the stuff made in Europe - I sit there thinking ""do something for the love of god""). In this case however, the writing was some of the best I have heard in years - not one word or line went to waste. The acting was superb with both Campbell and Ossie Davis at the top of their game. But most of all it is side-splittingly funny. Snot out the nose funny. Giggling hours later funny. And it's been a hell of a long time since I heard the word Kemosabe in anything.

They obviously managed to get a good distribution deal as we were able to get it in the Xtravision in Bandon. Don't watch it if you are tired but it is a movie not to be missed.

A few sample quotes courtesy of [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281686/quotes):

JFK: Just what are you getting at, Elvis?
Elvis: I think you know what I'm getting' at Mr. President. We're gonna kill us a mummy.

Elvis: Don't make me use my stuff on ya, baby!

Elvis: It'd been two presidential elections since I'd had a boner like that.

Elvis: LBJ is dead
JFK: Well, that ain't gonna stop him

[killing a scarab beetle]
Elvis: Never, but never fuck with the king!

Elvis: No offense, Jack, but President Kennedy was a white man.
JFK: They dyed me this color! That's how clever they are!

JFK: He had me on the floor. I had his mouth over my asshole!
Elvis: A shiteater?
JFK: I don't think so. He was after my soul. Now you can get that out of any major orifice of a person's body. I read about it.
Elvis: Oh, yeah? Where, man? Hustler?

Elvis: Now the two key words for tonight - ""caution"" and ""flammable"".
JFK: Also ""watch your ass"".

Elvis: T.C.B., baby."
Techie updates have moved,"I know the tech stuff annoys the foodie readers here and vice versa. So last week I started up a new Posterous blog over on [conoroneill.net](http://conoroneill.net/). It is much more high volume than this blog and consists mainly of pointers to interesting tech stuff, opinions thereof and the odd funny bit. So basically pretty much anything except food/Bandon, which will remain here.

I'll do the odd cross-reference when it makes sense. And hopefully the volume here will improve over the Spring as I get into a gardening groove. next post up is one on Jimmy Doherty's ""From Crop to Shop"" which may be one of the most educational programmes about food broadcast in the past ten years."

Thank You Dave,"We discovered over Christmas that you can in fact put 5 children, 2 adults and all their stuff in a Zafira+Roofbox and go from Cork to Kilkenny to Cavan to Cork. Hurrah.

On our trip back from Cavan on the joke's of national routes known as the N55 and N62, we got to Roscrea and Oscar decided to puke. We caught most of it in a nappy bag and then I dropped the bag as I exited it from the car. We pulled into the McDonald's carpark at the roundabout and proceeded to change both Oscar and Fionn. 

A McDonald's employee appeared and asked if we needed any help, we did. He headed off and got black sacks and a roll of kitchen paper. He introduced himself as Dave and stuck his card in my pocket. He then apologised for heading off but his shift was over. Two minutes later he reappeared with a cup of water for Oscar to wash out his mouth and another one of 7-Up which he told us to shake flat so it would settle Oscar's stomach (a trick we've used many times in the past).

Dave then left with the message to give any of the bits to staff and to just say that he had said so. I was so impressed with this guy. All of this help was unprompted and was deeply appreciated by us. I thought he was just one of the new-style Helper's in McDonald's which are a fantastic addition but when I checked his card later, I found he was the manager. 

Anyone who thinks McD's are going away any time soon had better wake up and smell the lattes they now serve. McD's are finally realising that customer service is just as important as the burgers to retain customers. It'll be employees like Dave who make that seachange happen.

Promote this man fast  - he's capable of far more than Roscrea!

Thanks again Dave.

The all-time worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted,"Congratulations to Myer's Maxol Garage in Mitchelstown. Without doubt the most disgusting, undrinkable excuse for a cup of coffee we have ever bought. I have to wonder if they are using mud in the machine rather than coffeee beans. I've had some pretty dire coffee over the years. What some Greek cafes did to Nescafe when I was there in 1988 should be banned under the Geneva Convention but they were better than the thing we had yesterday.

As for the toilets - I think the Monkey's from Madagascar got there first expecting a Tom Wolfe reading. For those of you who haven't seen Madagascar, think Trainspotting instead......

The Amstrad Cock Chair,"They really missed a trick on The Apprentice tonight. What man wouldn't buy a chair shaped like a giant knob? Light Cubes for £85, me hole.

Syed is a god of sales: ""these are the future of fuel cans"" - said with a totally straight face. A full recovery after his disasterous car sales technique where I am sure they cut some of his patter with one couple : ""This car is made of pure gold. It will be worth one billion pounds in three years time. If you buy it, I promise to give you my first born son, and my second born. Pleeeeeeease buy it.""

But I still miss Jo.

Best line of the night came from Margaret when she described Sharon, Syed and Tuan as ""The Whinger, the Liar and the Planner"".

Whew, he finally fired the whingey griping gooseberry-sucking sour-pussed Scot.

The Apprentice (UK),"I never got into the US version of The Apprentice. I think mainly because I've always thought of Trump as a tacky buffoon. I remember being brought to Trump Towers in 1987 by my American cousin (whirlwind tour of NY in one day including WTC, St Patrick's Cathederal and The Statue of Liberty) and thinking - how can you spend so much money and end up with a place looking so cheap?

Then they announce the UK version of The Apprentice and I hear that it's going to be Alan Sugar in the Trump role. 

Insant mixed emotions and reminiscences. My career in computers started in 1982 with a [St Kieran's College](http://www.kilkenny.ie/peop/educate3.html) school trip to Dublin. One of my friends brought me to the most amazing shop I had ever seen - ""Tomorrow's World"" - in a little arcade off Grafton Street. It was full of electronic gadgets and he showed me something the like of which I had never encountered before; the [Sinclair ZX81](http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zx81/zx81.htm). I can still remember touching the keypad and being amazed (pathetic really I know) when stuff appeared on the screen. A few months later, Sinclair announced the [ZX Spectrum](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/) and I knew I had to have one. Luckily my parents bought into the idea of it [""helping with the homework""](http://www2.b3ta.com/heyhey16k/) and one was duly acquired by a work colleague of my Dad in WH Smiths in the UK. I wouldn't be where I am today if they hadn't bought that wee computer. I went from Basic to Forth to Z80 Assembler over the space of 4 years. I got two games in Assembler published in [Your Sinclair](ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/magazines/YourSinclair/Issue04)/[Your Spectrum](ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/magazines/YourSpectrum/Issue21) in 1986 and I still have the bloody thing in the attic 23 years later!!!!

Sooooo, Sir Clive Sinclair was a great inventor but an absolutely disasterous businessman. Even at the age of 15 I despaired over his constant screw-ups with the Spectrum (Interface 2 cartridges, Microdrives etc etc). Eventually the company was sold for a song to Amstrad. And Alan Sugar did what he always does - screw innovation, lets squeeze the living daylights out of this whilst we still have a market and then give it the bullet. Broke my heart as a Sinclair fanatic but absolutely the right thing to do in retrospect as the home computer market was heading towards implosion. 

Unfortunately this approach to business in ultimately self-limiting. You only have to look how Amstrad went from being one of the largest PC makers in Europe to nothing because he was so obsessed with wringing every penny out of what he had, the market simply left him behind. Dell gets away with it because the component suppliers do the innovation and Dell provides the channel. But at the back of my mind I wonder if one day someone will innovate Dell out of existence.

He finally gets back to the original topic: I have become a huge fan of The Apprentice. Sugar is a bollix but he is usually right. I'm thrilled that I have predicted most of those who have been fired so far. I was chuffed to predict Sebastian last week before the program even started (good hair only gets you so far baby).

Predictions for winning? I had Paul and Saira marked from very early on but Paul has screwed up two weeks in a row (that TV ad was craptastic) and Saira's ""poor me"" routine the same week was embarassing (in addition to her manktabulous print ad). Miriam relies a bit too much on the boys doing the work for her due to her physical assets methinks. Ben was a donkey until last week when his negotiating skills were spot on. Tim has definite all-round potential. James is a star but has no hope of winning. I cannot see a public school boy being Bovver Boy Sugars apprentice, no matter how good he is. Poor Raj seems to be solid but can't string a coherent sentence together. Paul and Saira have the best chance because they are both gobby grafters with no airs and graces. Not sure which one it'll be. Give it another 2 weeks."
The ArseEnd Moves to Cork!,"The Swearing Gentleman has just been offered a job in Cork so it looks like South Galway's loss is the PROC's gain with the imminent arrival of [The Swearing Lady](http://arseendofireland.blogspot.com/), TSG and Mini Me. The ladies of Montenotte will be scandalised.

The Berlin Marathon 2016 - A race for everyone in a great city,"Our build up to Berlin had not been great. Between holidays, Red Hat Summit in SF, Red Hat Tech Exchange in Vietnam and a week of post-Vietnam illness, I only managed to get a few long runs in. D'wife also tripped whilst running, less than a week beforehand, and smashed her face up badly. But we had done the Clonakilty 10 Miler which we both felt went well. So we flew from Dublin the day before without too many nerves.

As soon as I set foot in the Expo to collect race numbers etc, the nerves started. Marathon number seven, the fourth one this year, but I felt like it was my first. The rest of the day was taken up with Checkpoint Charlie, the deeply moving Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and some of the worst service we've ever had [in a restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d7285098-Reviews-Vino_Basilico-Berlin.html).

![Checkpoint Charlie](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016-09-24%2014.24.51.jpg)

A real highlight was the kids race on Saturday. Over 10,000 children took part, along with a bunch of teachers. I'd love to see the Dublin or Cork Marathons do the same.

![Kid's Race](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016-09-24%2015.40.44.jpg)

The hotel was barely a 10 minute walk to the start line. The number of people at the start line was nuts. Just like London. The buzz we got when they showed the elites taking off was fantastic. I've said it a few times on Twitter already, but in what other sport can anyone take part in the same race as the fastest people in the world by just paying your few quid entrance fee? I hope this never changes as it makes long distance running something very special indeed.

![Start Line](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016-09-25%2017.18.52.jpg)

The course is dead flat, which is why the world record is broken here so often. Sadly I didn't break the record on this occasion. Maybe next time.

I loved the run. Despite the lack of prep and illness, I felt physically very strong the whole way around. I can't say the same thing about my brain which took 17 miles to settle down and STFU. The drinks stations were mental but they always arrived just as I needed them. And whoever is responsible for putting warm sweet tea at the drinks station needs to be paid a massive bonus.

The finish through Brandenburger Tor was one of those spine tingling moments. 

The German supporters were interesting. I found them a big help. There were lots of them (tho not at London levels) and they cheered lots. They also had music every mile or so which was fantastic, apart from the jazz obvs. But they don't shout your name like they do in London. In fact the only people who did shout were Brits and Aussies!

I got a Personal Best by only a few minutes (my Garmin data was garbage for some reason) and I felt pretty good within a few minutes of finishing, unlike Cork and Killarney where I was very wobbly.

Multiple pints and currywurst later and I was sorted. Thanks to Eoghan and Sabrina for that!

![Currywurst](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016-09-25%2017.46.14-1.jpg)

Highly recommended if you want to do a fast flat marathon in an iconic city.

The best comedy on British TV?,"""The IT Crowd""? Not a hope. ""Shameless""? Better. But the hands down winner has got to be ""The Apprentice"". Thank god for Sky+ so I could keep pausing to catch my breath after collapsing in gales of laughter.

Last week I called them a bag of spanners. This week it was ""The Spannerettes"". A gaggle of gormless girls and only the crazy one was talking any sense. I was getting seriously worried as I found myself agreeing with everything Jo said. She clearly had taken her daily slammer of Ritalin and Lithium but had maybe forgotten the Prozac chaser. I'm convinced they are going to keep her in until the second last episode.

A calendar for Great Ormonde St Childrens hospital and they decide to do a chic modernist one with kittens, unreadable dates and only one mention of the charity. Next week they'll be revealing their plan to sell Lego using challenging cartoons in Pakistan.

I think it was the first time I have seen a presentation to a customer where the presenter shusshed the customer when they tried to ask a question.

""Did you know that there are six million cat owners in the UK""? Did you know that when the first customer blanks you after such an opening, you don't use exactly the same line on the next two?

The blokes won but only by default. Syed's ""mind games"" so far consists of him telling everyone they are crap. Obviously he learned his tricks from the the Ladybird edition of ""My First Mindgames with Peter and Jane"".

Many of the lads seem to think that the route to success involves being a testosterone charged loud-mouth braggart. The dimwits haven't noticed that Amstrad already have one of those and he isn't going to be hiring a clone.

The Brooks Caldera 6 is an ultra-devouring monster (but),"UPDATE: See below for a major proviso to this post.

My entire history with Brooks until a few months ago was one pair of Adrenaline 19s which did not suit me at all. I always associated the brand with big reliable heavy running shoes for conservative joggers. The [Caldera 6](https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_ie/caldera-6-mens-distance-trail-running-shoe/110379.html) takes that reputation and shreds it, in the best possible sense.

![Caldera 6](/images/2023/05/caldera-6-mens-trail-running-shoe.png)

## The perfect shoe doesn't exist
I've been on the hunt for the ultimate ultra-distance trail running shoe since I started going longer in 2017. After a few false starts, I thought I'd found the perfect shoe in the Hoka Speedgoat 4. It was absolutely perfect for the Kerry Way Ultra Lite and all the training for the Kerry Way Ultra. The GTX version added too much weight but was superb for the nastier muckier stuff. Then they went and ruined things with the Speedgoat 5. It went from a completely locked-in shoe that felt part of your foot to this stretchy sloppy, albeit lighter, disappointment. Whilst it worked fine on the Kerry Way Ultra, I cinched the laces down so hard to stop slippage that I gave myself tendonitis. And whilst I loved the 4, there is no getting away from the fact that the much-lauded Vibram Megagrip is not very grippy at all on wet smooth stones.

So I was on a mission to find a replacement for the SG5. 

## Salomon Ultraglide
First stop was the Salomon Ultraglide. I'll do a full review soon but overall it's ""fine"". And definitely a major step backwards in grip.

## Saucony Xodus Ultra
Next up was the Saucony Xodus Ultra. Again full review soon but it was a disaster for me. The lugs are amazing on wet grass and mud. They are lethal on wet stones and rock. Worse than road shoes. And they have exactly the same problem as the Peregrines for me - horrendous heel pain due to an excessively narrow heel-counter. Which is weird since I adore the fit of the Endorphin series.

## New Balance Fresh Foam X More Trail v3
More recently, I tried the New Balance Fresh Foam X More Trail v3. This is an interesting shoe. Vibram Megagrip outsole with massive lugs. The giant slab of Fresh Foam X is incredibly comfortable and bouncy. On top of this is a roadshoe-like soft upper and 1970s Irish school-shoe laces. The NB is definitely on my short-list for the [Kerry Way Ultra](https://kerrywayultra.com/) and other less rough ultras where comfort is the key, now that I've bought proper laces. But they weren't great on a 5 mile rough loop around Coumshingaun in Waterford. The upper is far too sloppy with poor lockdown and the lugs had the same issue as the SG4/SG5 - fantastic on the mucky/wet stuff but slip-sliding on rocks. I split open my knee as a result. And a few weeks later, I fell again on some damp rocks.

## Caldera 6
And so on to the Caldera 6. They look like moonshoes, particularly in the Black/Yellow version I bought. First impressions were of a good fit/lockdown and decent bouncy midsole but not massively cushioned despite the height. The lugs aren't particularly deep. 

Some initial short trail runs showed that it could hold its own compared to all the others above on the mucky/grassy stuff. But it was when I went long and on lots of rocks that its true capabilities shone through.

The rubber in the Caldera 6 outsole is amazing on wet rocks, stones and slabs. I haven't had one slip. It grips like glue and gives massive confidence when running on mixed terrain. It transformed my experience of doing recces for the [Waterville Trail Running Festival](https://www.watervilletrailrunningfestival.com/).

And the midsole just seems perfectly tuned for ultra distances. Not too squishy and not too harsh, just right. So far I've done one 44km, one 88km and one 60km in the same pair and my feet were in perfect condition at the end of each. My forefoot was starting to ache after the 88km of the Waterville Trail Running Festival and the rough terrain of the [Beara Way Ultra](https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/2259) was starting to cause hotspots at 60km, but that's it. 

The lockdown is better than it looks but very rough conditions will challenge it. As for stability, the overall footprint of the shoe is very wide. So despite the high stack, you don't feel unstable. I did roll my ankle a lot at WTF but I put that down to me, since it stopped as soon as I started watching my foot placement more. I had no rolls on the Beara Way.

![Dirty Caldera 6](/images/2023/05/dirty_caldera.png)

As I don't want a repeat of the SG4-SG5 disappointment, I've already bought a second pair of Calderas and put them aside. I suspect version 7 is coming soon since I just got a pair of v6 for €97 when the RRP is €150!

If you're tired of tip-toeing on wet rocks, this is the shoe you've been looking for.

# Update - Maybe not so perfect
Things had continued to go well with the Calderas and I did multiple shorter trail runs after the Ultras. Then two weeks ago, after 150 miles, whilst out again on the Beara Way, I realised my left foot was sliding around badly. I looked down to see a complete separation of the two parts of the upper. I really can't believe Brooks only used glue to hold two highly stressed sections together with no stitching at all. It was almost guaranteed to fail eventually. For this reason I have to withdraw my recommendation unless you only run on very gentle American buffed trails. I'll continue to use the Caldera 6 but only now that I have re-glued and awl-stitched the two parts together on both shoes. They happily survived a very tough 64km trail run last weekend after my repairs. Hopefully Brooks sees this post and my tweet and fixes the problem for the Caldera 7. (No response on Twitter after a week. What is going on with major brands and the complete collapse of their customer support/interaction quality?)

The Chiltern Challenge 50k - Conor's First Ultra Marathon,"I made this comment on Twitter last week:

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Any chance we can narrow &quot;inspirational&quot; to mean &quot;inspired me to action&quot; instead of &quot;isn&#39;t that a nice story&quot;?</p>&mdash; Conor O&#39;Neill (@conoro) <a href=""https://twitter.com/conoro/status/887569059612676096"">July 19, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>

It was partially driven by the silly overuse of ""inspirational"" but also by the fact that I was inspired to run 50km last weekend by all of the amazing Ultrarunners in the US and Europe and the stories they tell via YouTube, Vimeo, Blogs, Twitter, Instagram, magazines and books.

The attraction of Ultras for me is both the off-road nature of them, with often breathtaking views, and the idea of pushing myself further. Whilst I'll continue to work on my weight and improve my awful slow road marathon times, I also want to just go further for longer.

Back to the inspirational thing again. At the MCI Ballina marathon in March, a woman got her award for 50 marathons. She had wanted to do 50 before 50. Her 25th had only been in the previous September! That got me thinking and I decided I wanted to do 50 before 50 too, but in my case, 50 miles. I have 10 months left to do it.

So what do you do before 50 miles? Why 50k natürlich.

Doing a 50k in Ireland turns out not to be easy. Most of the IMRA stuff is either very short or is hardcore open mountain which I just don't have the skills for yet. So I looked to the UK and discovered they have a *lot* of doable ones.

The one that really caught my eye was the [Chiltern Challenge](http://www.xnrg.co.uk/events/details/chiltern-challenge-ultra2017.aspx). They call it an ideal first Ultra and it had the added benefit of being near London. We came up with a cunning plan to spend a few days in Center Parcs in Woburn Forest with the kids and I'd disappear on the Saturday to do the race.

I didn't really do any specific training for it apart from doing more forest stuff. It's damned hard to do ""single track"" style trail running over any sort of distance here without resorting to mind-numbing loops. So those short runs plus 3 road marathons and 2 halves from Jan-July would have to suffice.

I had most of my kit sorted well ahead of time. Cheap Kalenji Hydration pack, cheap Leki poles, Altra Lone Peak 3.0 runners, usual marathon top etc. I got the right OS Map from the UK and drew out the entire course on it. Hmm, some very close contour lines in places.

![Map](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chiltern_map.jpg)

Then I started reading the race reviews more closely and they all mentioned the stifling heat last year.

And the panic set in.

The one thing that destroys me in races is heat, presumably due to my weight. I've had dog slow times in Cork twice and Berlin due to it. OK, I got a PB in blazing hot Brighton but was seriously head-fucked afterwards.

So I ordered 2x larger Salomon soft flasks in addition to the water bladder. I watched the temperature predictions like a hawk for two weeks. The closer the day got, the higher it went. 26C was the highest I saw mentioned. I stocked up on electrolytes for the bottles and had all my GUs ready too.

I read more reviews and sub-4-hr marathoners were talking about taking 8hrs. Even more panic. Could I end up running in the dark?

Then I started worrying about the pain in my right foot that had been there for a few weeks. The Lone Peaks don't have huge cushion. So I panic bought a pair of Hoka One One Cliftons despite being worried about their narrowness and size. Three off-road runs convinced me that they were a great choice. As long as it didn't rain too much.

The trip to Center Parcs was hassle-free but I was more tense than I've ever been before a run. I decided to read Cory Reese's book that night, [Nowhere Near First: Ultramarathon Adventures From The Back Of The Pack](https://www.amazon.com/Nowhere-Near-First-Ultramarathon-Adventures-ebook/dp/B01KW37P5M/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) as recommended by Sarah Lavender Smith in her book, [The Trail Runner's Companion](https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Runners-Companion-Step-Step-ebook/dp/B071WDHGCW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1500834677&sr=1-1&keywords=the+trail+runners+companion) (review coming shortly). I am so glad I did. After the initial shock of what he had to deal with as a kid, this is a truly uplifting, funny and, dare I say it again, inspirational, book. I went to bed feeling a lot better about the run and actually slept ok.

The usual insanity of a Google Maps back-road route got me to Princes Risborough school with tons of time to spare. There were a lot more people than I was expecting. We were the non-elite 9am group. The walkers started at 8am and the elites would hunt us down like prey starting at 10am. Weather predictions still varied wildly but so far it was dull and drizzly so I was a very happy camper.

The RD gave a great pep talk and really settled my nerves. His show-of-hands proved that there were a lot of first-timers with me, which also helped.

![Start line](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2008.46.05.jpg)

And with zero fanfare, off we went.

I kept the poles strapped to the hydration pack for later but actually never used them. There was probably only two places where they would have been very useful.

The 70+ yo woman passed me pretty quickly. I'm not bitter :-) She was fast!

People started walking very early which was frustrating as it hadn't got hilly yet and it was almost single-track. But then we quickly got to an extremely steep piece with wooden steps and had a queue at the top to get through the stile.

Despite all the RD warnings, people went off-course almost immediately. But they were called back in each case. It turned out that my paper map, compass, OS Maps on Android, paper map photos, Open Street Maps, route on my Garmin watch and Offline Google Maps were not just overkill, they were completely unnecessary. Between the signs, painted arrows on the ground and the knotted tape, there was only one spot in the entire 50k where I was unsure where to go because some arsehole had torn down an arrow (we could see the zip-ties).

I'm not going to do a mile by mile account, don't worry.

![Field](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2010.38.11.jpg)

The route was everything I had hoped for and nothing I had feared. A couple of steep sections but the rest of it was rolling hills. Most of it was forest.

![Forest](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2015.04.51.jpg)

But there were also some lovely tracks through fields of wheat (a la Theresa May):

![Wheat](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2014.58.13.jpg)

Also fields of corn, peas and beans.

![Corn](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2012.19.07.jpg)

I did exactly as planned and ran the downhills/flats and walked the uphills. I had one aim and that was to finish, no matter how long it took. The downside of this is that I got lazy pretty early. My legs were not having a good day and felt leaden throughout. So any sort of incline had me walking.

As with road marathons, I stuck mostly to myself. For whatever reason, I'm not chatty when I'm running. I'm probably just stuck in my head. I'll talk to anyone who talks to me but I don't start many chats on runs. It was the same on Saturday. I tended to end up running near people but rarely with them.

There were 4 check-points, all of which had drinks, food and very very friendly volunteers. Each one gave me a huge boost and I was in no hurry to leave any of them.

Obviously this is not a race with crowds of supporters but there were a couple of places where people gave me a big cheer and it was bloody wonderful.

As the day progressed, I was in top mental form. The best ever in a race. I was loving every minute of it and had no issues apart from a pain that was growing in my left calf and two squished bloody little toes.

![Another field](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2015.31.41.jpg)

I had long chats in my head about the amazing [Public Rights of Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_way_in_England_and_Wales) and [Freedom to Roam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam) rules in the UK. The areas where I was running has a maze of routes, paths and tracks over private land. The gates and stiles worked well and I saw no rubbish anywhere. Meanwhile in Ireland, we're still living in some sort of John B Keane play.

There were lots of pre-warnings about briars and nettles so I had also done an emergency purchase of cheap Kalenji leg sleeves in the week before. They worked brilliantly for the nettles apart from the head-height ones.

![Nettles](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2014.48.41.jpg)

The sleeves also seemed to help a lot with the left calf pain.

There was a stretch of a couple of miles on a road which I hated. Not only was it incredibly steep in places, I also had to deal with cars. This was by far my slowest segment. All of the others were within minutes of each other.

I couldn't believe it when I got to marathon distance and I was feeling great!

The comedy highlight was me thinking someone was shouting encouragement to me from across a field. Then I realised it was a sheep.

About 5km from the end I caught up with a group of 4 young people and had a bit of a natter. They were n00bs too and some of them were struggling. I walked for a bit with them but when they said they were going to walk all the rest, I decided to move on.

I got to a brilliant steep downhill section and bombed it, which was possibly not the most sensible thing to do near the end but it was fun. Then a run across a big field, a tiny bit more walking and OMG, there's the school. I ran into the playground, got a big cheer and crossed the finish line feeling like a million dollars.

I bloody did it. And I didn't hurt too much. And if I had to go further to go, I'd have been ok with that.

![Finish Line](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15%2016.52.11-1.jpg)

I got some pics taken and had a magical cup of tea.

Then into the car and back to Woburn with a smile on my face which would not go away.

I was over the moon to see my brilliant wife and 15yo standing at the entrance to the giant Center Parcs car park. They took the car off me so I could wander over to the holiday home and find the best-damned-tasting curry and beer in years waiting for me.

![Medal](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-16%2009.00.51.jpg)

In the week since, I've been thinking about it a lot. I really did love almost every minute. I am immensely proud of myself despite the extremely slow time. And now I want to do more. Soon. And push myself harder and see what this old body can do.

As for the [Chiltern Challenge](http://www.xnrg.co.uk/events/details/chiltern-challenge-ultra2017.aspx) itself, I have only good things to say about it and the organisers. They are absolutely correct in saying it's a perfect first Ultra. Anyone who has run a road marathon is more than capable of doing a good time. Apart from the odd tree-root and nettle, it's not remotely technical.

Go on, give it a go.

Oh, you're wondering about my time eh?

Check out this for consistency :-)

The coolest place on the planet to work - IDEO,"Way back in 1999, I was on a week long training course in Stanford which had been arranged by Enterprise Ireland. It was a fabulous week and I learned a hell of a lot about entrepreneurship, the mindset of Silicon Valley and what the hell VC was all about. 

But the best bits of the trip were the site visits to various companies. Some were rubbish; Cisco sent in their Software Configuration Manager to tell us about version control. Some were a bit strange; SGI had loads of restaurants whilst in the process of nearly going bust; Excite let us have a go on their indoor slide and gave a bland presentation and then a week later sold for a couple of billion to @Home. Some were bloody interesting; Guidant showed us how a stent is made; We got a tour of Bill n Dave's offices in HP; We had an eerie feeling as we walked around Genentech thinking all sorts of science fiction fantasies. 

But the highlight for me and all the other geeks was [IDEO](http://www.ideo.com/). This is a very straightforward company in concept - they do industrial design on contract. But their approach to idea generation and innovation is utterly unique. These people simply have huge fun making some of the most interesting products you can buy.

They showed us the development cycle they went through for a few things like a portable defibrillator. They let us play in their ""box of tricks"" which contained tons of materials and objects that they found interesting for whatever reason (texture, behaviour, colour etc). Every aspect of the company is done in a way to encourage new ideas, lateral thinking, relaxation and most of all, fun. This is a word much abused by corporate drones who think fun is a P&L in orange and green. But these guys _get_ it. Every year they are hired by a VC company from Sand Hill Rd to build their entry for the Soap Box Derby. They are paid to do this! I realised at that point that I had done the wrong degree....... 

I know this may not sound particularly awe-inspiring but that changes when you find out some of the things they have developed over the years: The first production mouse for the Apple Lisa, the Palm V, the Humulin Insulin Pen, the original Microsoft Mouse, the Psion Wavefinder and one I particularly liked: [the Berkley Fishing Reel Combo](http://www.ideo.com/portfolio/re.asp?x=12272).  These guys are design greats.

Tom Kelley, their CEO, wrote a great book a few years ago called ""[The Art of Innovation : Lessons in Creativity from IDEO, America's Leading Design Firm](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385499841/102-6118171-4870501?v=glance)"". If you want to think sideways a bit, buy this book. 

[Tom Peters had just flagged](http://www.tompeters.com/entries.php?rss=1&note=http://www.tompeters.com/blogs/main/008317.php) that Kelley has a new book called  ""The Ten Faces of Innovation: IDEO's Strategies for Defeating the Devil's Advocate and Driving Creativity Throughout Your Organization"". I think I'll be paying a visit to Amazon.

The fatally flawed Salomon Sense Pro Max,"I read some reviews of the [Sense Pro Max](https://www.salomon.com/uk/product/sense-pro-max.html) last year and they looked like a good pair of mixed surface running shoes. However they came with the usual Salomon price tag and I didn't have a specific need for them.

Fast-forward to January this year and I started getting worried about the footwear I was going to use in my first 50 Miler, the [Liverpool to Manchester Ultra](http://www.gbultras.com/liverpool-to-manchester-ultra/). Then I spotted that the Salomons were half price on Wiggle. €73 was an absolute steal so I immediately ordered them. The mix of very high stack plus that grippy sole seemed to be the perfect combo for LIVMAN.

Initial signs were good apart from the speedlace mechanism being very stiff on one side.

I did a few 8-10 mile mixed road/trail runs which seemed ok. I'd been having some achilles problems due to the mileage increase so I didn't pay much attention to the fact that my knees werea little bit sore after each run.

![Sense Pro Max](/images/2018/03/salomon_sense_pro_max.jpg)

This past Saturday we headed up West to do a small local Marathon. This would be the final test of the shoes to decide if I'd use them for LIVMAN.

The first flaw kicked in after a mile - a relentless loud squeak from the left shoe on every footstep. Yup, 26 miles and 5+ hours of squeak squeak squeak. The same thing was mentioned in [the review on Ultrarunner Podcast](https://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/salomon-sense-pro-max-review/). So it's clearly not a one-off, there is a sole design problem.

As the miles added up, I noticed a pain on the outside of both knees increasing. By mile 16 or so, it was very sore. Then I discovered it was worse when I walked. And then I discovered that it was excruciating when going from walk to run. Every drink stop from then on was torture.

I finished with both knees in agony. The left side seized as I walked away from the finish. Luckily I had voltarol gel in my bag but I had to jog back to the hotel because I couldn't walk. 2 days later and the pain is still there, albeit much reduced (yay voltarol).

I've run in a ton of different shoes - Asics, VFFs, Hokas, Altras, Skechers and Inov-8s. None of them have ever caused anything like this. And again, this isn't unique to me. [Running Shoes Guru](https://www.runningshoesguru.com/2017/11/salomon-sense-pro-max-review/) had _exactly_ the same problem. There appears to be a fundamental design flaw in these shoes. I don't know what it is, but you really need to avoid them. The fact that they are half-price after less than a year on the market hints that Salomon are either going to cancel them or replace them soon.

On a positive note, I also got the [Salomon Advanced Skin 5](https://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/salomon-advanced-skin-5-set/) hydration vest for LIVMAN and it's superb. I ran the Lusk marathon with it as a test and it worked brilliantly. The only glitch, as mentioned in reviews, is that it's difficult to get the soft flasks back into the vest when it's on. Not exactly a deal-breaker."
The first blog by Irish smokers.....of food?,"In what I hope is the first of many by high-quality food producers in Ireland, [Ummera Smoked Products](http://www.ummera.com/) have launched their own blog. You can find it over at [ummera.wordpress.com](http://ummera.wordpress.com/).

Anthony seems really enthusiastic about using technology to enable him to do business more efficiently and I hope my (ahem) multitude of readers encourage him to keep blogging regularly by providing him with constant feedback. The big news on their blog is the [new packaging/labelling](http://ummera.wordpress.com/2006/01/14/new-packaging/) which is a major improvement and really catches the eye on the shelf. Their products are available in most good foodie outlets, particularly in Cork, so check out the new labels and let him know what you think.

There is also mention on the blog of the [new Farmers Market in Kinsale](http://ummera.wordpress.com/2006/02/01/farmers-market-in-kinsale/) which I'll have to check out (even tho Earl from ""My Name is Earl"" now makes me feel like a girl dressed in pink).

Unfortunately, the main person trying to set up a similar market in Bandon died recently. Hopefully someone else involved in food in the area (Clodagh? Padraigín?) will take up the torch. I'd be more than willing to help but my lack of local contacts and the fact that I don't work in the business means there would be no point in me trying to kick it off.
But in any case, I'm really thrilled that Anthony has leaped into the world of blogging and is at the vanguard of the next generation of food marketing in Ireland. The fact that he is using wordpress.com developed mainly by [Donncha](http://blogs.linux.ie/xeer/) from Cork, is just a bonus!

The Floods,"Our thoughts are with all those families and businesses damaged by the horrendous floods in West Cork this week. 

We were lucky. Apart from the inconvenience of no phoneline and some bad leaks in a bay window, we managed to escape pretty unscathed. 

If you have any detour tips for those trying to get in and out of West Cork, please leave them in the comments. This route was still working at 2pm yesterday so hopefully it'll work for you. (Click on it for larger size):

Bandon had been doing a large marketing push for November. Now more than ever, we should shop locally and help those businesses get back on their feet."
The Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar - A great watch with one infuriating design flaw,"After a couple of great years with the Forerunner 935, the ever-reducing battery life started to become annoying and I decided last summer to upgrade to the 955 Solar.

![955 Solar](/images/2023/06/955solar.jpg)

Overall I like the feature-set and it generally feels like a solid upgrade to the 935. I particularly love the maps navigation. Being able to load up a course like the Beara Way Ultra and follow it via glances, along with some buzzes and beeps for major turns and going off-course, is an amazing time and hassle saver. I haven't gone off-course or gotten lost once since I started using it. 

But there is one infuriating thing, the damned buttons. Initially the mechanism just felt cheap and stiff. I bought a lot of $15-$30 watches from Aliexpress in 2019 for a work project and most of them had better button feel. But on the 955 they then started sticking and double-clicking. Remember this is a watch that cost €650! 

I sent it back to the store and they had to wait 6 weeks for a replacement to arrive.

There was the same stiffness in the buttons of the replacement initially and then, you've got to be kidding me, they started sticking again.

I put up with it for months despite it driving me nuts, as I didn't want to wait another 6 weeks for a replacement. Every time I pressed the crappy light button and it came half way out, paused and then came fully out, I thought ""I paid €650 for this rubbish"".

Last week the annoyance got too much and I opened a support ticket directly with Garmin. I pointed out that it's clearly a design flaw with the watch and plenty of people are complaining about it online. I asked if I could trade it in for a different model and I would pay the difference. The 2 day response time was 6 days: No possibility of a trade-in and they are only offering a pre-owned watch in replacement. Presumably I'll get one of the thousands that have been returned due to having sticking buttons

That's Garmin's idea of customer service? A used watch for something still under warranty? A used watch that will almost definitely have the same problem as the other two?

Garmin feels a bit like mid-90s Nokia at the moment. Releasing a crazy number of devices for every demographic and clearly not putting the effort in to design or manufacture them well. Apple ate Nokia's lunch and I suspect Apple + Coros will eat Garmin's. Their one big defence is their existing customer base. But if offering a used watch to a loyal customer who has bought 5 watches and an InReach is how they want to do customer retention, they are in for a nasty surprise over the next couple of years."
The Good Things Cafe  - The 2 Day Kitchen Miracle Programme,"I spent last weekend on a fabulous 2-day cookery course down in deep West Cork in [The Good Things Cafe](http://www.thegoodthingscafe.com/) in Durrus. I honestly won't be able to come up with enough superlatives to describe the fantastic programme that Carmel Somers put together. It is now Tuesday and I'm still buzzed and still full.

[![20052006043](http://static.flickr.com/45/150561542_4848485f4b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/150561542/ ""Photo Sharing"")

It's not too bad a drive from Bandon - about an hour on the crappy but scenic Dunmanway Road. Durrus seems to have attracted a cluster of foodies to live there and the wonderful views may explain why. The Cafe is about a mile out of the village on the Akahista road.

I arrived to discover that I was the only bloke along with five women. They were a great bunch and consisted of Eileen from Thurles and her two daughters Mary and Catriona who were giving Eileen a birthday treat, Mairead from Cork and Lucy from Bantry (by way of Zimbabwe). Carmel was assisted by Rebecca from Spain and Helen. They were verrrrrryy patient with us as we stumbled over everything in a commercial kitchen.

The two days consisted of Carmel giving some demonstrations and then us trying to replicate her food or even do things from scratch using her recipes. Some of it was solo but mainly we did it in pairs which was much better fun and we permanently got in each others way. Apologies to Mary for eating all the smoked salmon.

[![20052006036](http://static.flickr.com/56/150561068_0a421585ec.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/150561068/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Carmel seems to know everyone involved in food in Ireland (and good chunks of England too) and had a story behind every ingredient that she used. There was not a dull or quiet moment in the two days and her patience was endless.

Our first recipe was a pork chop with thyme and garlic. It turns out that, like us, she uses Martin Carey in Bandon for her meat and his thick chops were awesome. This was a simple simple recipe but [a] I forgot how to hold a knife I was so intimidated by a commercial kitchen and [b] when I finally managed to cook it, it was bloody gorgeous. We also did a spud thing whose name fails me (and whose recipe I managed to lose). We sliced spuds in a mandolin and then layered them up in a tiny frying pan, cooked it, flipped it and drizzled some butter on it. Kinda like a sliced version of rosti.

[![20052006050](http://static.flickr.com/47/150560713_beb4b0c587.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/150560713/ ""Photo Sharing"")

We made a bunch of soups, all of which were fab and also got on to one thing I have always founds ""challenging""  - bread making. As I explained to her, all of my previous attempts would break windows. After I came back from a few months in Silicon Valley in 1996, I spent weeks growing a sourdough starter in the hot-press. The first loaf I made could have been used to start a garden rockery. 

[![20052006040](http://static.flickr.com/54/150561332_462be3d7de.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/150561332/ ""Photo Sharing"")

So to say I approached this task with trepidation is putting it mildly. Carmel explained that she can nearly always tell which loaves have been made by the men because we knead it like we are trying to kill it. It wasn't the first time she had to tell me to relax over the weekend (I also attempted to beat some eggs into a parallel universe).  And ye know, it is far less stressful if you knead the thing gently. We left the dough to rise, split it in two, re-kneaded and then put them in the oven. And they all turned out perfectly!

[![20052006053](http://static.flickr.com/46/150560920_a6e6cae713.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/150560920/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Carmel then did some dough, rolled it out really thinkly, covered it in swiss chard and durrus cheese and popped it in the oven. For lunch we had that as the best pizza I have had in years, the pork chop, the spuds, some salad and some wine. Yum!

Then on to the recipes for dinner. Myself and Mary did a spiced lamb and aubergine stew which I made nice n spicy with some extra cayenne. I've become addicted to Frank's Red Hot Sauce and add heat whenever I can.  We also did a roast chicken with some tarragon butter under the skin. The way Carmel does roast chicken is so smart I will never do it any other way. The others another chicken and also a pot roast one.

[![20052006054](http://static.flickr.com/52/150560994_7fe231a3c7.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/150560994/ ""Photo Sharing"")

We also did some desserts - banana in a stock syrup and lime juice, raspberries in syrup and rhubarb with ginger. I'm salivating writing about them. We also did a raw rhubarb, cucumber and mint salad which turned out to be really tasty.

All of the above made up the evening meal to which all of us could bring guests. Carmel was an absolute star and offered to let me bring a bunch of the food home to share with Catherine, so I headed off with food in car just as the meal began. Everything was totally eat-a-licious, nothing was left!

We had arranged to meet at the Schull Farmer's Market at 10am on Sunday. I awoke to torrential rain. The one extra I got on my car when I bought it 5 years ago was ESP. It stops you spinning when you drive like a cretin on slippy roads. Anyhoo, the ESP light flashed all the way to Schull as I hit sheet after sheet of surface water. I genuinely expected neither vendors nor buyers to turn up. I drove past the market to discover a few brave souls setting up stalls and a few minutes later, the other students arrived, as did Carmel with kids in tow.

We sheltered in under the Gubbeen stall and the women interrogated Fingal and we all bought a ton of stuff off him: rashers of every sort, sausages, chorizo, you name it. A really friendly guy, hugely knowledgeable but in a very infectious and enthusiastic way. He also gave us big discounts for turning up in the brutal weather so I'm now his biggest fan. Mimi was selling some awsome looking cooked burgers but I was stuffed from brekkie. One guy was setting up sushi and a wok too. Looked interesting! I bought some herbs and carrots from the lovely German woman from Peppermint Farm. She had a very unusual set of herb plants, many of them medicinal. We all then booted it back to Durrus.

[![20052006038](http://static.flickr.com/45/150561204_dbc349b6e2.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/150561204/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Carmel kicked off with a fish stock and then got us all to make a banana and chocolate cake. Mairead and her then started on the seafood risotto. I challenged them to make it in the advertised 20 mins as I have never made one in less than 35\. The wenches did it in 19.5 mins. I still don't know how. The rest of us prepped a pile of tiny squid. As father of four pooh factories, I was not as grossed out as some of the younger students. We all then had a go at the Alioli which was energetic to put it mildly. It was from a different world than Hellmann's and I'll be making it again (but using a machine!). We cooked up the squid with just parsley, garlic and lemon. Gorgeous. And all of the above made up our lunch along with some pan fried hake. We sat for ages and sipped wine and then coffee. I could not physically move.

It all wrapped up about 4pm and we all bought various bits n pieces from the shop and headed off on our separate ways, full to the brim and full of confidence.

As I said at the start, this is a fabulous course by a great lady. And you'll be shocked to hear the price. €300! A steal. Think of the food and drink alone! Run to the phone and book a course. +353-27-61426, info@thegoodthingscafe.com.

And finally, I hope Carmel does not mind, [but here is a short video of her in action jointing a chicken]

The Good Wine Show in Cork,"If you haven't heard about it already, you'll want to know about the [Good Wine Show](http://goodwineshow.com/) happening this Friday 13th and Saturday 14th of November. It's a joint effort between the three best independent wine retailers in the country: [Curious Wines](http://www.curiouswines.ie/), [Bubble Brothers](http://www.bubblebrothers.com/) and [Karwig Wines](http://www.karwigwines.ie/).

![goodwine](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/goodwine.png ""goodwine"")

It's on in the Clarion Hotel in Cork from 3pm - 8pm on Friday and 11am - 4pm on Saturday and only costs €15\. For that you'll have over 100 international wines to taste and buy, delicious foods and gourmet treats on offer and prize draws for wine cases and food hampers.

This isn't a show for wine gurus at all. If you like a nice glass of NZ Sauvignon Blanc every once in a while, you'll enjoy it just as much as those who know the difference between a 1947 and 1948 Margaux.

You can buy tickets online right now or in any of the aforementioned Wine Merchants. [We'll](http://business.loudervoice.com/) be there on Friday and possibly on Saturday too, soliciting your feedback on everything so have your SMS thumbs to the ready."
The Grange Tavern - When only a carvery will do (Structured),"Two Saturdays ago, the parents, the kids and I headed off to Clon to go to the playground and then check out Deasy's in Ring. We have had several recommendations for Deasy's and I thought a good pub lunch would go down nicely and suit the sprogs too. It was deserted on our arrival and my mother eventually found someone who told her they only do evening meals and Sunday lunch. Bum. But she said the menu looked fab. The nice man then pointed us towards Grange and The Grange Tavern a few miles up the back road.

On arrival I realised it was just up from the place where we watched the cool harness racing last summer. It looked good from the outside and in we trooped. I made the usual mistake of going into the bar first. The Deliverance music started in my head as a small group of serious drinkers eyeballed me. I turned around and went into the lounge. 

Initial impressions were not good. It was a dark room with pretty crappy furniture and a small carvery food warming unit in the corner. But we checked out the blackboard and it seemed like a good pub selection. We all plumped for the roast pork. A pity that the kids menu was standard burgers/sausages/fish finger fare but hell, my kids like that stuff and they get proper food 95% of the time so I won't begrudge them a few chips.

All of the staff were really friendly and I was very impressed when they offered to hold on to my food until I had finished feeding Fionn. A simple touch but it showed the right attitude to service. 

The plates arrived out piled high with pork, mashies, carrots, apple sauce, gravy and stuffing. And blow me if it wasn't just a great pub dinner. Better than that, it was one of the best pub meals I have had in years. Juicy pork, tangy apple sauce, hand cut carrots. Really really wholesome family food. I nearly licked the plate. 

We all had rice pudding for dessert, which again was clearly handmade as it was a wee bit undercooked but still tasty. A round of coffees and cappuccinos finished it off perfectly. Meanwhile, the pub had gone from empty to full in 30 minutes and the whole ambiance changed for the better. The lads loved it cos they could run around and know they were annoying no-one and the adults could all relax. 

This pub will never win a food award and it will never be a gastro-pub, it just does simple tasty traditional pub food with a surprising attention to detail. If you are down that direction and you feel like a nice pint and some solid fare, you can't go wrong.

The Grange Tavern - When only a carvery will do,"Two saturdays ago, the parents, the kids and I headed off to Clon to go to the playground and then check out Deasy's in Ring. We have had several recommendations for Deasy's and I thought a good pub lunch would go down nicely and suit the sprogs too. It was deserted on our arrival and my mother eventually found someone who told her they only do evening meals and sunday lunch. Bum. But she said the menu looked fab.

The Hackney Hardman is back,"It's been a long wait but the man who put the AMS is Amstrad is back on our screens, hurrah! And what a bag of spanners he has collected for this series;

How about the bipolar woman who cried during the first firing cos Sir Alan was mean to the girls? Quite possibly the most annoying woman on British TV after one short episode, so I assume he'll keep her.

Or Syed who told us that he has a ""gameplan"" and wants to play mind games but so far seems to have all the cunning of the most cunning plan in cunningland by Baldrick. He is another keeper like Paul last year. No hope of winning but should be good for a weekly laugh.

Or poor Ben who had all the charisma of a corpse and got fired last night after his ass whooping by the women.

I cannot wait for the next 11 epsiodes. TV gold I tell ya.

The important science of Potato Thermodynamics,"A phrase I have used many times in the past: ""Only in Japan"".

The inaugural Beara Way Ultra - Don't bring a knife to a gunfight,"## Guaranteed finish
I'm pretty sure the great Hal Higdon's training plan for an ultra would be:

* Do minimal daily sessions
* Do one long slow amble a week
* Skip core and glute exercises for a month
* Don't get that long-term hamstring issue sorted out
* DNF after 88K of [a different ultra](https://www.watervilletrailrunningfestival.com/130km-ultra) three weeks prior
* Don't sleep for the week beforehand

Setup for success like this, I headed to Castletownbere at 3am from Bandon to try the first ever [Beara Way Ultra](https://www.imra.ie/events/details/id/2259/).

![Indy](/images/2023/06/Indy_Sword_Gun_Text2.gif)

## To do the Beara you must first understand the Beara. Or something.
For the [Kerry Way Ultra](https://kerrywayultra.com/) I had reccied every inch of the course. For Beara, I had done Glengarriff to Adrigole and Adrigole to Castletownbere a few years previously. I also did the Castletownbere/Allihies loop this year. 

Oh and how could I forget the world's shortest recce in January. I parked outside Kenmare and tried to run back towards Lauragh. Within minutes I was wading through ice-cold water in completely useless small-lugged Salomons. After 2 miles I called it a day and slid all the way back. The water was so cold, the midsoles of the running shoes went rock hard. I may have damaged the road back to the car.

So in summary, I was heading to Beara terrified. The huge section from Eyeries to Glengarriff was a complete unknown to me and the elevation profile looked horrendous.

## The first Western States 100 had 14 entries
I was surprised that fewer than 40 people had signed up despite lots of excitement about it. Even tho I was completely unprepared and still smarting from my [WTF DNF/Time-Out](https://conoroneill.com/2023/05/22/having-a-wtf-moment-at-the-waterville-trail-running-festival/), I couldn't miss the chance to run the first ever instance of a race that I'm convinced is going to be famous. 

As I walked from the car up to the school start line, everything started hurting. Because of course it does. The two rules of start lines - you absolutely have to go to the toilet right now and every niggle you've ever had in you life says ""hello, remember me?""

I got setup with a tracker and laid out my ridiculously overstocked drop bags. This was followed by 15 minutes of staring out to sea trying to calm myself down and finding myself incapable of stringing a sentence together.

![Start Line](/images/2023/06/utb1.jpg)

## Like a bullet train
The race started incredibly well as I immediately went into last place.

A couple of road miles were followed by some lumpy bits and then mixed terrain all the way to Allihies. Whilst this all went fine, the heat was building and the niggles didn't settle.

The stretch after Allihies along the coast is jaw-dropping. Just go. It was also where the wheels started coming off for me. My stomach started churning, the heat got worse and suddenly I was incredibly tired after what was barely a training run. 

![Start Line](/images/2023/06/utb2.jpg)

## You're going the wrong way. No I'm just slow.
The grind out towards Dursey was brutal for me but two things made it easier. The first was meeting the front-runners on the way back and their words of encouragement. The second was Crow Head. I had a Grand Canyon moment there. Anyone who was been there knows the Grand Canyon feeling - your brain can't absorb it. It's so epic, it actually looks like a painting. The way the water flowed around the rocks on Crow Head did that to me. I purposely didn't take a picture or video because I knew I couldn't do it justice.

There's one ""trip and it's the bottom of the Atlantic for you matey"" section around there but otherwise it's a continuation of never-ending ups and downs.

![Start Line](/images/2023/06/utb3.jpg)

## What's this core training y'all keep talking about?
About 10 miles in, I had two horrible realisations - [1] I hadn't recovered at all from WTF and was already exhausted and [2] My core and quads were both also trashed from WTF and even running downhill hurt like hell.

By the time I got to the Dursey cable car (and yay it'll be back in action next week!) I was out of water, overheated and struggling badly. But the water-station crew did a brilliant job of boosting me. And like so many lovely aid station people, they lied through their teeth - ""Oh ya, there's several people behind you"". Sure sure. I know I'm last.

Weirdly I started catching someone. And I realised he was wearing a rain-jacket. Zipped up. What the actual fuck? I'll tell you more about [Adolfo Garcia](https://www.strava.com/athletes/16739862) in a bit.

## Luxury
He and I toed and froed for a few miles and ended up back in Allihies almost together. I had to get some fizzy drinks in the shop and then just topped up my water and grabbed some food from my drop bag. I stopped at the incredible copper mines to eat some of it. At which point I realised I couldn't eat. Every mouthful made me want to vomit. But compared to the men, women and children who dug into these hills to mine copper 200 years ago, I was having a grand old time.

Adolofo stopped to explain that he had busted his ankle after 10km and was in a lot of pain. Most people would have quit but he kept on going.

The guys back in Allihies concurred with me that I had no hope of making the 11 hour cut-off in Eyeries but I pushed a bit anyway. The ups killed me and the downs weren't much better. At least I was well hydrated now but all food/gels made me nauseous. At this stage Adolfo seemed to have fallen quite far back and I couldn't see him.

## Ayeries? Eeeeeries? Aries?
Eventually I ambled into Eyeries assuming I was over time. But nooooooo, I had 50 seconds left to grab my next drop bag and leave.

![Start Line](/images/2023/06/utb4.jpg)

I'm sure tougher people than me would have taken the bag and headed off, but I had nothing left at that stage. Legs and core were bollixed and my stomach was in bits. 

Third Ultra DNF in a row then.

The team at the aid station took care of me extremely well as I sat and waited for Adolfo, who was now well over time. I tried nibbling on various bits in my drop bag but all had the same effect, instant nausea. Weirdly the cup of coffee I was given went down fine.

## Some like it hot
Adolfo arrived and we had a fantastic chat. I finally got to the bottom of his zipped up rain jacket on a scorching hot day - he was heat training for [Lavaredo Ultra Trail](https://lavaredo.utmb.world/) in a month's time. That's a very very smart move by him.

The brilliant aid team drove us back to the start and that was the end of my day on the Beara.

## Everyone else
Of the 38 starters, 24 finished. Stephen Mangan ran an amazing race to win and Lianne van Dijk demolished the course to come second overall. A ton of really great runners also DNFed but mostly in places like Lauragh and Glengarriff. Messed up stomachs and trench foot seemed to be the two most common complaints.

## The eternal DNFer question
Should I have DNFed? I wondered for a week and then curiosity got the better of me - so I did an Eyeries-Ardgroom out-and-back a week later and an Ardgroom-Lauragh out-and-back a week after that. Whilst those two sections were a *lot* easier than I expected, I realised I had no hope of going beyond Ardgroom on race day. 

So it was the right call to quit but I don't regret giving it a go for 60km. The race is going to grow and grow as people learn about it and I'm just so happy to have been part of the first outing, even for such a short period of time.

The main thing I've learned in the past two scorching hot weeks is that I chronically under-hydrate. And I think that's what gets me into trouble (ditto Connemarathon and Cork City last year). I drank double the amount on those post-recces as I did in the race and I had no issues at all, despite both days being hotter. So I'm going to have to learn to like carrying a water bladder.

UPDATE: After feeling rubbish for quite a while, I went to the Doctor 3 weeks after Beara and got a set of blood tests. The results are in - I have a low ferritin level of 22. I think that explains why I've been struggling in these recent races with wooziness etc. Despite eating a very iron-rich vegan diet, I suspect my 15+ year use of omeprazole has finally bitten me in the ass. Let's see if things improve over the summer with iron supplements and cold-tofurkey on the acid reflux!

## Thank Yous
The logistics of such a long race are extremely difficult, particularly with the terrain and the remoteness of much of the Beara. I take my bucket hat off to the RDs Michael McSweeney, Robbie Williams and Carol Hurley. This is the beginning of something very special. 

To all the volunteers, IMRA members and Beara AC folks - thank you thank you. I wouldn't have made it past the cable car without you all. And I know you all went above and beyond for those who were out for 34hrs+.

And like all these ultras in Ireland, it just can't happen without the fantastic landowners. 

## 2024 yeah?
Of bloody course I am. I've already started training for it. Ok ok, it's for the Kerry Way Ultra but I'm already doing a lot more elevation and miles only two weeks later. My main things to focus on are getting comfortable with the non-stop ups and downs and dealing with the boggier stuff between Lauragh and Glengarriff. 

## Women are tougher than men
Three women started the Beara Way Ultra 2023. Three women finished. As any man who has stood in a delivery ward can confirm, women kick our asses when it comes to toughness.  

But we have to do something about the cultural thing where overly-confident incompetent men (like yours truly) will enter a 100 miler completely unprepared whilst hundreds of women around the country, who are more than capable of finishing, don't take part.

Oh, by the way, you want to see grit? Then watch the film about [Sally McRae's Cocodona 250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIkGsxCp-14). I grimaced the entire way.

## Should *you* try it?
I think anyone who has done other hilly ultras in Cork, Kerry and Wicklow would be able to at least give it a good go. Strangely, I don't think a KWU finish would automatically mean you can deal with Beara. It's 20 miles shorter but the relentless elevation change and huge amount of bog is very different to Iveragh. I have to assume anyone who does alpine ultras or did the UTS 100 recently could handle it ok. 

So it's not like I said about Waterville where anyone who has done a marathon could give it a lash. It's a different beast and that's what's so wonderful about it. 

Some day, I'd love to see an ultra series - Sheep's Head Way, Beara Way, Kerry Way and Dingle Way. Maybe when they finally create a Mizen Way, we could have one there too. How epic would that be!"
The IT Crowd - Oh no no no no no,"If I told you that the title of the programme should have the letters ""Sh"" at the start, you'd probably think I wasn't very funny. Well that's how funny ""The IT Crowd"" is. I wanted to give up after ten minutes but lasted to the end for the same reason people rubber-neck car crashes.

My six year old son reads me funnier knock-knock jokes from his ""My first book of knock-knock jokes"" than Graham Linehan came up with for this embarassment of a comedy. I watched some of the set-ups with my jaw on the floor ""he is not seriously going to do the 'person talking into the telephone that isn't connected' routine is he?"" - oh god he just did. Not only that but five minutes later ""no, no way, he cannot now be following this with the 'person typing on the computer that isn't plugged in' routine, can he"", you betcha!

The acting is pretty dreadful but not as bad as the writing. We have the annoying mucker from ""The Clinic"" hamming it up and desperately over-acting in an attempt to make the thing funny. And we have someone else trying to do his version of a variety of ""Fast Show"" characters. They even attempted some slap-stick humour. At this point I nearly switched over to a documentary on the hibernation habits of the Greenland lesser spotted egret. I can see this show getting punted to 11pm very very quickly.

They also roped Chris Morris into a small role on it. But that's hardly surprising as he hasn't been in anything remotely funny since Brass Eye (Jam or Nathan Barley anyone? No I didn't think so). I nearly forgot to mention the canned laughter. Oh dear god, the canned laughter. Imagine the laughter track from worst 1970's sitcom possible but now imagine it with a deaf and blind person deciding when to insert the laughter. Who did they use for this? ""Discount Eddie's Quick Lube and Sound Studio""?

This is not a rant from a techie who cringed about the RTFM t-shirt or the ZX81 reference in the programme. This is a rant from someone who loves great TV comedy. Graham Linehan was responsible for one classic TV series - ""Father Ted"", one good TV Series - ""Black Books"" and a pair of awful ones - ""Big Train"",  ""Paris"". Did they just throw a bunch of money at him to make ""The IT Crowd"" and he sent this in for a bet? Maybe doing his own version of ""The Producers""? Or maybe he was the writer in ""Father Ted"" who, when they could have come up with something witty to say in many of the scenes, said, ""nah, let's just insert a few feck, drink, girls, lines instead"".

When the US is giving us fabulous comedy writing in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", ""Arrested Development"", ""My Name is Earl"" and even a great re-write in the American ""Office"" ('Blue-Collar, White-Collar, I'm collar-blind'. Genius!), is this really the best that Channel 4 can drag out of the swamp?

"The Kerry Ultra 50K - Go on, sign-up for 2019","[The Kerry Ultra 50K](https://kerryultra.com/) was somehow not on my radar but luckily my wife spotted it recently. We decided to do it barely a week beforehand.

  

Unlike a lot of ultras over in the UK, this one was all on-road and mostly self-supported. There was a small table every 10K with water and Redbull only.

  

We went down to Tralee the night before to make the race briefing. Brian O'Shea went into huge detail on both the 50K and 100K which weirdly made me more stressed than if I'd known nothing.

  

The 16 people who did the 100K headed off at 6am whereas we had a nice relaxing lie-in and breakfast in the Ashe Hotel. 31 of us lined up at 10am amid lots of good humour and photos. After another pep talk from Brian, off we went.

  

As always, you'll get no mile by mile summary from me. Basically I had a bad day. Lots of stuff hurt after a few miles and I was hot and slightly out of sorts almost from the start. But I plugged away at the back of the field and took in the fabulous views over Tralee Bay.

  

I've come tothe conclusion recently that I don't really like long road races and much prefer the trails. My wife is the opposite. She had a good day and powered away from me early. 

  

A very long pit-stop involving a 99 cone and Club Orange in the lovely Fenit totally re-energised me even if it took forever. Fun fact - Saint Brendan The Explorer is from Fenit and that is one impressive statue of him.

  

The Blennerville windmill looked as good as ever and then I hit the worst part of the route. A couple of miles of back roads to make up the 50K instead of the lovely walkway beside the river.

  

I kept my head down and was never so happy to see the Aquadome in Tralee. The nicest cup of tea of all time awaited me at the finish line. 

  

I was thrilled that my wife finished her first ultra after the disappointment of Liverpool to Manchester. We hung around for a short while and cheered in a few more people. But I was feeling very ropey from the heat and we hit the road back to Bandon shortly afterwards.

  

Apart from probably not drinking enough fluids, I was in a good state overall later and recovered quickly over the next few days.

  

I'd love to see more people doing this race. Honestly, if you've ever done even one marathon, you'll do this no bother. Don't be put off by the ""self-supported"" aspect. Just get a cheap hydration vest in Decathlon or Wiggle, stick in a few bottles of water, some Tailwind and a few gels/sweets and you'll be fine. The course was extremely well marked (I had Viewranger for backup) and Vincent Guthrie from MCI and the Tullaroan Marathon was checking in on people with his van in the early sections to make sure all was well.

  

Apart from a couple of sections, I felt quite safe with the traffic. The tight road leaving Ardfert and some of the bits after Blennerville did feel a bit dodgy with totally blind bends. But there are huge parts of it that are very quiet or very straight. And those views, seriously!

  

Great job by the organisers. And I'll say it again, you should think about doing it next year. Wouldn't you like to be able to tell people you're an ultrarunner :-)"

## Some Day

I had been vaguely aware of the [Kerry Way Ultra](http://www.kerrywayultra.com/) for quite a few years and I even heard an elite US ultra runner list it as their top bucket list race on a podcast. But it was so far out of reach for me as to be almost mythical. Then I heard about the Lite edition and thought ""some day some day"".

But 18 months of Covid, getting that bit older, losing a ton of weight and loving the Killorglin 12-12 snapped me out of that wishful thinking nonsense and made me sign up. In fact that whole carpe diem thing has become a major driving force for me in 2021.

Between some earlier 2019 hikes/walks and a bunch of recces this year, I had covered most of the route, apart from a few miles around Templenoe and a few out beyond Torc. So I was going into it with a good understanding of the terrain and elevation. 

I'd been suffering non-stop issues with my hips, right leg, sciatic nerve and general ""below the waist"" nonsense for 2 years which only got worse after my fall on the [Sheep's Head Way FKT](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/) in May. But some simple exercises from a physio focused on my glutes along with a hairdressers ""jockey chair"" for my tech job solved 90% of it over July and August. 

Between the recces and the exercises, I was feeling very positive heading towards September, despite not having a proper training plan and not doing a lot of mileage at all. But it was still a huge prospect for me to try and do it well and hope it was neither scorching hot nor a quagmire.

## Today

I packed for every eventuality including earthquake, typhoon, moon crashing into the earth and rain, but woke up to a perfect slightly cool morning in Killarney. 

Top tip for vegans/veggies, the [Brehon Hotel](https://www.thebrehon.com/) has entire menus just for you. Unfortunately we were too early for the brekkie so the brilliant [Flahavans Overnight Oats](https://www.flahavans.ie/product/flahavans-cranberry-chia-seeds-overnight-oats/) with a banana did the trick. My pack wasn't toooo crazy once I'd calmed down. 

![Gear](/images/2021/10/gear.jpg)


My Crew-Wife, as I christened Catherine, drove myself and her former teammate John from Laz Lake's [Circumpolar Race Around the World](https://www.craw.racing/) to Sneem. I had the same immediate feeling I'd had in Chamonix on our family summer holiday in 2019 - I have found my people. To see a tiny village buzzing with energy, excitement and people at such an early hour was just magical. I immediately had to go for a wee with the nervous giddiness.

![Sneem](/images/2021/10/sneem.jpg)


As we passed mandatory gearcheck, John said ""you know who that was checking your bag? Aoife Mundow!"". ""Holy crap, no way"". ""Will we go get a photo with her?"" ""Hell yes"". 

Cue photo of the very embarassed bad-ass Aoife with two grinning auld fellas.

![Aoife Mundow](/images/2021/10/aoife.jpg)


Now go listen to the mind-boggling [Inspirational Runner Podcast](https://theinspirationalrunner.podbean.com/e/podcast-103-aoife-mundow-the-pursuit-of-personal-limits-24hr-irish-track-record-holder-kerry-way-ultra-winner/) interview with her and hear the story of someone going from average road runner to one of the best ultra runners in Europe in the space of two years.

##  Goooooooooooooo
I found myself getting a bit emotional every time someone from the Full passed through the village as we waited for the start of the Lite. Then, suddenly, it was time. Oh sheeeeeeeeeeeeet, here we go. 

As long time readers of this blog will know, I do not write those mile by mile race reports that are very common. I'm more about the highlights and lowlights and hopefully some useful tips if you are thinking of doing the race yourself. 

The first 7 miles were a doddle. Paths, lanes, roads, old tracks. Nothing remotely rough and it was absolutely ideal underfoot due to the recent good weather. There are some wooden walkways in those places that tend to get very boggy along the entire course. It was slow tho as it's quite narrow for a few miles and you can end up stuck behind slower runners. I can't believe I'm writing those words as I'm usually that soldier.

I was having a wonderful start but then, oh jesus christ, we started encountering the walking dead. The poor bastards who were doing the Full and were completely broken. They weren't just walking, they were inching forward. I can't imagine how hard it must have been for them to have 200 people rush past them, each one telling them they were doing great. My respect for each of you in that pain-cave is endless. If you finished it, with 50-odd km to go, in that state, then you are a proper legend.

As for the Lite, once that first easy bit is done, you get into some hilly, rockier stuff for a few miles but it's nothing too bad. You might use poles there if you have them. I'd strongly recommend them in general if only for the hill out of Kenmare and for some help in the latter miles.

## Dem views
There's an absolutely gorgeous section after Blackwater Bridge along the water in the woods. It's one of my favourite parts of the whole course. I was now on that one big chunk I'd never reccied including a short jog on the main road to Templenoe. I hadn't arranged any support stop with Catherine here but I wish I had. I didn't actually need anything but seeing all the support crews and everyone getting stocked-up and boosted-up hit me really hard mentally. Particularly since the next couple of miles were all uphill on roads and I found them extremely hard. But then, just as my misery was at a peak, so was the road, and bam, downhill blast for a couple of joyful miles. I was back baby.

The next off-road section is all the way into Kenmare and is the worst from a terrain point of view. It's also manky boggy in places when it has been raining (Feb-Jan in Ireland), which luckily it wasn't on the day. But there's lots of pretty steep rough ground and I had two near face-plants as I stumbled due to the legs getting a bit tired.

![Vista](/images/2021/10/vista.jpg)

## Kenmare
You then have another lovely downhill into Kenmare with lots of people out and about and tons of support crews. Practical note - there's free public loos right in the centre just at the carpark if you need them.

I met Catherine at the far side of the town opposite Supervalu. Most of the other crews were in a carpark in the centre of town, which might have been better for me for an emotional boost. But in reality I was fine and Catherine's energy got me buzzing again.

I stripped down the excessive clothes, lost a bunch of crap from my pack, refilled my water/Zero/Tailwind, stuffed my face with crisps and full-fat coke, and headed off after a pretty short stop. I braced myself for the next three miles.

## Bastard Hill
I don't know about anyone else, but those 3 miles out of Kenmare and into the old Kenmare Road are the toughest of the lot. That damned hill out of the town is hard to drive up, let alone walk/jog. And when you finally do all the ups and downs, then you have the Old Kenmare Road trail itself which is also incredibly steep at the start.

Whilst I hated that hill, it made me finally realise something - I was killing it on the uphills. There were lots of people who flew past me on the downs and the flats, but I caught them every single time on the ups. I'm convinced that was due to the physio exercises and really focusing on not being bent-over going uphill. I drove everything through my glutes and the poles. For once I managed to protect my hip flexors. Hell, I even had zero quad or hamstring pain during or after the race. 

Now when I say ""killing it"", I mean walking quickly, not running. Or power-hiking as Ryan Ploeckelman calls it. But it was way faster than many people who were easily half my age. One poor guy in his twenties kept racing past me at high speed and then would stop suddenly and start stretching. I finally asked him what was going on. His hamstrings were trashed. I'm guessing he was far too agressive earlier in the race. The slowness of old age has its advantages sometimes.

## The New Hotness
Whilst I was having a phenomenal day leg-wise, the same was not true of my stomach or head. I was really feeling the heat and every time I ate, I got pukey. At times I felt light-headed too. I originally thought it was down to overdressing for cooler weather earlier but it was still happening after the gear change. Worse, every time I tried to run at any sort of decent pace, my heart rate went through the roof.

I came up with a theory that it was related to my massive weight loss in 2020/2021. I imagined that the temperature PID Controller (for Engineering nerds) in my body had been tuned over twenty years of obesity for a much bigger mass. So when it now had to deal with a very light mass, it overshot in both directions making me either too hot or too cold. I had terrible problems last winter where any hint of coldness would spiral out of control and leave me shivering completely out of proportion (P in PID) to the actual room temperature. 

After doing Ecotrail Wicklow 46km three weeks later in similar heat, I'm now thinking it was more to do with lack of fluids. I had the same problem in Wicklow but I got it under control by drinking lots of fluids in the latter half of the race. I really didn't drink enough at all in Kerry.

## The Old Kenmare Road
If you haven't run or hiked the Old Kenmare road, you should. It's just lovely and dead easy. There's only a few tiny short rocky bits. I'm convinced I have met more Germans on it in the past two years than Irish people. Maybe everyone thinks it's a road? It isn't. I assume it was one at some stage? Famine times? I tried to imagine edging forward on the lumpy ground in a pony and trap from Kenmare to Killarney 150 years ago. Not fun.

![Conor Downhill](/images/2021/10/conor_kwu_lite_2.jpg)

So that whole segment along Old Kenmare heading towards Torc is up and down and up and down but it's not hard. You'll be tired but the scenery will make up for it. On the downside, you'll keep thinking you're about to get to the waterfall ""any minute now"" but it never seems to arrive.

## Romance Guru
There are some small stream crossings on the Old Kenmare Road which other runners were taking full advantage of to cool down. I finally did so when I reached quite a large stream with a bridge. I'd brought a [Katadyn BeFree 1L Filter softflask](https://www.bergfreunde.eu/katadyn-befree-filter-1l-water-filter/) as a backup to my two Salomon 500ml flasks and filled it twice. Once to spray all over myself and once to drink. Some heat exhaustion may have gone to my head because I filled it for a third time and put it in my pack as I thought Catherine would really like some lovely Kerry Mountain Water. After a mile of sloshing and regaining some sanity, I emptied it. She confirmed later that she did not in fact have any interest in Kerry Mountain Water. Even filtered.

## Yes. No. Uh-huh. Nope. Oh. Wow. Yep. Really?
The big change with encountering the Full runners now was how much better condition they were in. Some of them were really moving strongly. All seemed chipper and chatty. Not that I chat much in races. Sorry to anyone who thinks I'm a grumpy unfriendly fucker in races. If you talk to me, I'll happily chat back. But basically all the blood leaves my brain and I find it impossible to form even vaguely intelligent sentences. So I rarely initiate.

## Cue The Stone Roses
Fiiiiiiiinally I reached the first waterfall upper carpark and nearly missed the turn. It's weird how the worst signage for the Kerry Way is from Torc to Killarney itself. And it's even worse in the main park. Ye know, where all the tourists are. It's way too easy to go astray around there but there'll be tons of people around so just ask one.

I trotted down the track and the rocky steps to the waterfall. Nearly face-planted again as I missed a step. Under the road I went and into the main park beside the lakes.


## Afternoon Tea in Muckross with Mark Labbett
I now only had 4ish miles to go but fuck me they are the longest four miles in the universe. There were tourists and Jarveys everywhere. I was exhausted. I tried running but it was just start/stop, start/stop. And then something lovely happened.

Another runner came trotting past and said ""Howya. I just wanted to say thanks. I've been chasing you for hours but I could never quite catch you. And I finally have. Thanks for being my motivation today, it was a huge help"". Maybe some people would be bothered by that but I was thrilled. I replied ""I know exactly what you mean. I was doing the same to two young guys for ages. I finally left them two miles back"".

After three centuries, I made it out of the park. And sure then it's just a few hundred yards to the finish. Hah, just kidding, it's another century and a half. I picked up the pace a bit. Come on you old fart, run. Run you old fucker. And I did. I saw Randall's Garage and the crowd and I almost lost it completely.

## I'm Not Crying You're Crying

I turned the corner into the world's most wonderfully low-key finish line and my wife. I was handed a lovely wooden fridge-magnet medal and free wheel alignment by the force of nature that is Eileen Daly. 

![Medal](/images/2021/10/medal.jpg)


And then the tears came. 

But they didn't last long as we had to deal with John puking and looking very bad. The ambulance sorted him out. 

I sat on the ground, took off my Hokas and just revelled in what I had done. Maybe I looked rough too as Eileen asked me if I was OK. I said ""I'm amazing. In the scheme of things, I'm amazing"". 

What I should have said is ""You're amazing Eileen, thank you""

## Losing 38kg Somehow Makes You Faster?
In the mixed field I came somewhere around the middle. 7th person over 50 (I'm 53). For reference, I came last in the 2010 Bandon Half Marathon and they'd run out of medals by the time I finished the 2012 Dublin Marathon. It's interesting what switching to only eating plants and giving up most booze in January 2020 can do to an old body. I still haven't written that post. The improvement in all my body stats is a bit shocking TBH.

The King of Black Puddin' Passes Away,"Edward Twomey was Mr Clonakilty Black Pudding. I was sad to read in my local Bandon Opinion last week that he had passed away. The story of Edward and his pudding is one that I think very few people know.

Since I started eating out, I have often run into Clonakilty Black Pudding on menus. I have also seen many articles raving about it. But until I moved to Bandon, I honestly thought that it was a general description for all pudding from the town. In my overly florid imagination, I pictured Black Pudding shops on every street corner: ""Tom's Traditional Pud"", ""Mary's Home Made Pud"", ""Gunters Organic Free Range Pud"". Hell, I even imagined street hawkers cooking it on black pud stalls. 

It turns out, surprise surprise, that the reality is nothing like that. The Clonakilty Black pudding of world renown is Eddie Twomey from start to finish. You can find his butchers shop about half way up the main street in Clon and apart from the famous pud, they do everything a high quality butcher should. 

I hope The Bandon Opinion won't mind if paraphrase some bits from Diane Curtin's article to give a short summary of Edward and what he achieved.

The butchers shop was owned by the Harringtons when Edward bought it. He found the old pudding recipe there and asked Paddy Allman who had made it for 44 years to make him some. Unfortunately Paddy died a few months after Edward had bought the butchers and the details of the recipe pretty much died with him.

So Edward decided to try to make it himself and basically used all of the old customers as his guinea pigs until they were happy that he had got it right. He then got permission from the Harringtons to use their name on the label - hence ""Original Harrington's Recipe"" on every black pudding he sold.

Most stories would end there and a local butcher would have happily sold local pud to local people. Instead this mans fantastic energy and ambition meant that it became one of the most famous food products made on this island. I am honestly in awe of the man. From one tiny shop in Clon, he made a product which is known and loved everywhere by foodies and non-foodies alike.

I really think that he should be up there in the roll-call of Irish Food Legends. His story should give hope and motivation to anyone who is making a quality product of any sort on a small scale and dreams of bigger things.

The power of branding,"Yoplait have recently completely changed the labels on their yoghurts. Our kids are now refusing to eat them ""cos they are not the same"". 

I'm willing to be that a huge percentage of yoghurt sales are for kids. Did any brand manager actually ask any kids what they thought? Any blip noticed in sales? Blip down, right? 

Sometimes, just sometimes, leaving things as they are is the smart thing to do.

The RTE Digital TV Switchover and a Xoro DTV-M5 Review,"I recently wrote about our switch away from Sky and on to Freesat and [Saorview](http://www.saorview.ie/) using the Ariva 120 Combo box. After initial success I can no longer recommend that box to anyone. It crashes constantly, it loses channels and its recording features are worse than agricultural. Actually, I've come to the conclusion that it must be faulty it's that bad, so I'm returning for repair and will report back.

However, it it critically important that anyone who relies on their standard roof aerial to get RTE, TV3 etc knows what is happening on Dec 31st 2012\. Whilst there have been Saorview flyers in the post and the Dept of Communications has put together [this horror of a web-site](http://www.goingdigital.ie/), I have severe doubts that those whom it will affect most are even aware of the analogue TV shutdown. My biggest concern is that older people are the ones most likely to be still using non-digital TV and they simply won't know that the switchover is happening.

I strongly recommend that if you know anyone who is not on Sky/UPC/etc and is still using a roof aerial to get their small set of channels, let them know they need to move to a digital receiver in the next 12 months. In fact they can move now, since the Saorview service is working really well.

Given the dire financial situation in the country, any extra cost on people is going to be a strain so I was thrilled when Barry from [tvtrade.ie](http://tvtrade.ie/) contacted me about the [Xoro DTV-M5 Digital TV Receiver](http://www.tvtrade.ie/digital-tv.html). He had read my review of the Ariva and wondered if I would review their inexpensive Xoro box for them. At €49 for a fully-functional Irish Terrestrial DTV box, of course I said yes. He shot me down a review unit for free a couple of days later and I've been beating it up for the past few weeks.

Short aside: I need to clarify the difference between ""Saorview"" and Irish DTT. You will see a lot of boxes on the market like the Xoro that are labelled Irish DTT or Irish Digital TV but which are not Saorview-certified. You shouldn't worry about this in the slightest. Either the boxes obey the relevant standards that Saorview uses or they don't. If they don't, you simply return the box for a full refund. It's a bit like saying your PC is certified to access the internet. That's why we have Standards in the tech world. The key thing with Saorview is that the box can decode MPEG-4 video and can display the Programme Guide (EPG). The Xoro does both perfectly.

First the basics. The really nice thing about Saorview is that if you have an alright RTE aerial signal now, you literally unplug the aerial lead from the back of your TV, plug it into the Xoro box, plug a Scart or HDMI lead from the Xoro back to your TV and you should now be receiving RTE, TV3, TG4 and some other stations (not UK) in crystal clear digital. You also get a bunch of Irish radio stations in digital too. It really is that simple. In fact, even if you have a buzzy RTE signal, it'll probably work perfectly and fuzz-free for Saorview.

Now on to the Xoro box itself. It's tiny! I love getting neat units like this which can fit into the smallest nook or cranny. The front panel has just Power, Channnel+, Channel- and USB. I really wish all the box manufacturers would put the USB on the side or the back but most have it on the front. More on USB later.

This picture shows its size compared to an XBOX (excuse the messy cable setup, I moved it quickly between rooms last night so the kids could watch the Toy Show):

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cJ6zumbM4HI/TtoTqnA_R5I/AAAAAAAATcI/ie8DTnklLiU/s400/IMG_20111203_121023.jpg ""Xoro DTV-M5"")

Usage is dead simple simple and the box goes from off to showing a TV programme in a couple of seconds. You can channel change up/down as you'd expect and Saorview has a 7-day Programme Guide, so you can see what's coming-up on-screen. You can use Scart (for older TVs) or HDMI (for LCD/Plasma) to connect to the TV. It handles all the various picture resolutions up to 1080p but I'm pretty sure nothing on Saorview is at that high-res yet. There is teletext handling there too but as it's not 1987, I didn't bother check. The remote is fiddly compared to a Sky+ one but is fine and you get used to it in a few minutes.

Like all Irish DTT boxes, the TV channel list is as follows:

*   RTE One
*   RTE Two HD
*   TV3
*   TG4
*   3e
*   RTE News Now
*   RTE Jr
*   RTE One +1
*   RTE Aertel
Radio is as follows:

*   RTE Radio 1
*   RTE 2fm
*   RTE Lyric fm
*   RTE Radio na Gaeltachta
*   RTE 2XM
*   RTE Choice
*   RTEjr
*   RTE Gold
*   RTE Pulse
*   RTE Radio 1 Extra
The bit that really impresses me with the Xoro is the USB/PVR. Basically you plug a portable USB harddisk into it and you now have the ability to pause/play/record/timer-record anything that is being broadcast. The overall setup is similar to Sky+ but obviously isn't going to be as slick. Unlike the hell that is the Ariva 120, it all works really well including getting the programme name right (helllllo Ferguson, can you sort that out?).

I did have issues with one harddisk but it turns out that this is a very common problem. Harddisks of around 500GB capacity that are USB-powered struggle to get enough juice from many USB ports. In fact my troublesome one doesn't work on any of my PC's USB hubs either, I have to use a split-cable for it. The same split-cable trick worked on the Xoro. In general (not Xoro specific) you should either use a smaller less power-hungry HDD, which are hard to get, or use one that has it's own power supply. Also these set-top-boxes prefer to format the harddrive themselves. It only takes a second.

If you have a bunch of media files (movies, tv, music), you can copy them onto the harddisk and the media player on the Xoro should be able to handle them no matter what the format. I tried an SD AVI, a 720p x264 MKV and a 1080p AVI and they all worked perfectly.

There's not much more to say. It's a very impressive piece of kit at a shockingly low price and no-one should have any hassle figuring out how to use it. If anyone asks me to recommend an Irish DTT box from now on, I'll point them to the Xoro.

And please, let older relatives and neighbours know that the switchover is coming and they need to get a DTT box. In the UK they are doing information days and a travelling roadshow across the country to let people know. What are they doing here?

The Seasons of my mind,"We didn't have a ""formal"" family holiday in 2005 - a week in Rosslare

with the extended family was it for us. As year-end approached,

weariness grew. So we threw caution to the wind, threw the children to

their granny and headed down from Cavan to Capital City for some

pampering and unashamed luxury. 

Stop reading now if you are offended by the profligate spending by people

of their own money when there are still starving babbies in Biafra

who don't have a hand knitted scarf yet.

Yes, we stayed and had dinner at the Four Seasons in Ballsbridge. I'd

been there once before for a business meeting (Pot of Tea for 3 = €17

if memory serves) and my main recollections were that it was a

butt-ugly building with tons of money spent on fittings and furnishings

to make up for the fact that it looks like an office block. They also

seemed to have an enormous number of staff who didn't appear to do much

apart from smile and say hello.

This time we arrived up in the filthy Zafira and decided not to go for

valet parking beside the Bentleys. To be fair, they did park some

people-carriers (mini-vans/MPVs for my US readers) beside the Porsche

Cayennes. Hard to tell which were more ugly. The Porsche Cayenne - the

SUV for rich people who spell Classy with a K.

Very friendly staff everywhere and if they had any direct dealings with

you, they always knew your name. Actually I found that a bit spooky. No

nose-picking in the lounge or farting in the pool for me then.

A short pause for a moment. To save the numb fingers on my left hand

from RSI, please automatically insert the phrase ""as well it should at

this price"" after every sentence from now on.

The room was lovely but not the gold-leaf toilet-paper experience I

thought it might be. Rose petals scattered around the place and a nice

bottle of fizz welcomed us in. Excellent bed and I loved the bathroom

with the all-glass shower. The balcony was cool but the weather meant

it was ununsed.

I had expected the place to be filled with emaciated super-models and

their sugar-daddies with maybe a pack of surgically enhanced peroxided

ladies-who-lunch hunting in the lounge for prey. But actually it mainly

seemed to be perfectly normal looking families with screaming children

which I really liked. They gave the place a comfortable feel which is

missing on first look because of all the Donald Trump style opulence.

Catherine raved about the pool, jacuzzi and whole ""health centre"" bit.

I couldn't even tell you what floor it was on.

We ate there that night and it was an interesting mix of experiences.

Georgina Campbell's guide damned it with faint praise but supposedly

Gerry Ryan is always raving about it. Hmm, now who's judgement would I

trust more? The meal started really badly. A nice greeter person

brought us to our table in the very large almost empty restaurant. And

where did she put us? Beside a table of 15 people including 4 children!

Ahhh, romantic. Dozey bint, surely this is ""seating 101"" in Maitre d'

school? So we asked to be moved. The poor waiter dropped a very funny

clunker when he whispers ""nah, I don't like children either"". We

replied that we actually had 4 children but we just didn't want to have

to listen to kids bickering tonight. Poor lad was very embarrased.

The food was really really excellent. A pleasant surprise for me as I

wasn't expecting much. Started with three little amuse bouches which

were all simple but bursting with flavour. Starters were fois gras for

Catherine and for me, a likkle wikkle partridge. Fantastic wee bird.

There was a small white thing on the edge of the plate. Was it what I

thought it was? Ok, now that's funny. A moulded piece of pear. And

before you post a comment about the fois gras, stop, find something

interesting to say about something important (e.g. Darfur) and post it

on another blog instead. 

Mains were a very nice steak for me but I can't bloody remember the

details. Three weeks later and I'm blank and neither of us can remember

what Catherine had. Desserts were the first ever restaurant souffle for

me and presumably something chocolate for Catherine. The souffle was a

fabulous fruity thing. A nice bottle of some Italian white (no idea

what it was) rounded it all off. I remember the food being superb but

there is something amiss when I cannot remember the details of what the

main courses were. I still remember what I had in Otto's months ago.

Top class food but actually the pricing is totally out of whack. It was

a great meal (one of the best for us in 2005) but it was the most

expensive meal we have ever eaten. For similar money, you could fly to

Cork, get a taxi to Otto's Creative Catering, get the best meal you'll

eat all year, stay there overnight and fly back. Or repeat the exercise

to the Tannery in Dungarvan. Yeah I know it is D4 and I know it is The

Four Seasons but it simply does not add up. Just pick one of at least

ten better places to eat in Dublin for a lot less and get a limo to

bring you!

Just at the end of the meal Catherine nudged me and said ""that's that

guy from 'The Restaurant'"". For those of you outside Ireland, ""The

Restaurant"" is a TV programme where allegedly famous people act as head

chef for a night and reviewers give them scores. A likable programme

and the Maitre d' is a complete scream. Totally over the top camp. And

that was him doing the formal table schmooze in The Four Seasons. He

arrived at our table, asked how everything was and then moved on. We

were disappointed he was so subdued but I guess there is a time and

place for everything.

The following night we ate in O'Connells in Bewleys Hotel across the

road. Really simple, excellent food with top quality ingredients. Great

charcuterie platter to start (let me guess, Gubbeen, right?) and

fantastic roast pork loin for main. Remembered that, didn't I? Three

people, two courses each and a bottle of wine. €85! Is there any better

value in Dublin? Highly recommended. I'd also recommend the hotel at

€99 per family room. The building both inside and outside is fabulous.

A ""discount"" hotel outclassing the high-end hotel next door. Genius!

But screw it, for a bit of pure pampering, as a one-off never to be

repeated treat, go spend a night or two at the Four Seasons. It'll cost

ya a bomb but probably less than flying to Majorca on a crappy plane,

staying in a hell hole, eating rubbish, getting sloshed for a fortnight

and getting treatment for skin cancer.

Massive thanks to Granny Mary for minding the childer for our little

post-christmas escape. Hell, I wouldn't offer to mind our kids if they

weren't mine .

"The Seven Heads Walk, Fuschia Walk and Lusitania Trail is one of West Cork's best kept secrets. Just go.","Shortly after we moved to Bandon, over 10 years ago, I bought a bunch of Ordnance Survey maps of the area and two books by Damien Enright called ""[Walks of Courtmacsherry Bay & The Seven Heads](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Walks-Courtmacsherry-Seven-Damien-Enright/dp/1902631005)"" and ""Walks in and around Kinsale"". We had high hopes of being outdoorsy. To our shame, the most we ever did was to haul the kids along the short track in Kilbrittain woods, the even shorter one in Ballinspittle woods and the tiny bit longer one in Dromillihy woods.

The lack of places to safely walk in West Cork outside of towns is ridiculous. I have a separate monster blogpost coming that includes this topic. It's a cracker. But this one is about [The Seven Heads](http://www.sevenheadspeninsula.ie/).

{{< youtube 3QOn-AdXV_s >}}

I've recently become very interested in the whole idea of trail running. By interested I mean I watch huge numbers of YouTube videos about it and revel in the incredible achievements of people who do races like [The Barkley Marathons](http://barkleymovie.com/) or [UTMB (Ultra Trail de Mont Blanc)](http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/) which started two hours ago. But a few weeks ago I finally decided I wanted to make some sort of attempt at doing it myself. Of course I had to do a pre-run, so I hauled the smaller kids out to Courtmac and the start of what now seems to be more formally called The Lusitania Trail.

As I did when dragged on walks by my parents, they hated every step. I loved every minute. The route was basically the first recommended short loop. You can read all the details over on the superb pages on [Explore West Cork](http://explorewestcork.ie/walking/seven-heads-walk/). In fact I printed out their directions and made a copy of that section of Map 87. In reality you need none of that, since the whole thing is now signposted as The Lusitania Trail.

It's the ever-changing views that make this such a spectacular walk. You begin in Courtmac, then into woods with beautiful little slipways down to the water, then suddenly the first gobsmacking headland and the Atlantic.

It's a pretty easy walk apart from places where the cows have mushed the ground up badly. Lots of stiles separate the fields and it's completely safe. The Fuschia Walk is absolutely beautiful and you come back through the lovely Ramsey Hill cottages and then on footpath all the way to Courtmac.

It was tough on the ankles in places but the weather was fantastic so I didn't need trail runners.

![Ankles](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2010.54.54.jpg)

Two weeks later I was back again. This time it was a 15 mile loop that again started in Timoleague. I found that the written directions on Explore West Cork were very hard to follow and I did a lot of recce via Google Maps and the Ordnance Survey map in advance.

In the end, yet again, the entire route was signposted and took almost no thinking on my part. The only place I got confused was on Broadstrand where you have to go the entire length of the beach before you see the steps back up to the road.

There is one very steep path up along some fields and then an old pre-Famine road.

![Start famine Road](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07 11.52.16.jpg)

Which eventually brings you out to this amazing view.

![Headlands](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2012.09.01.jpg)


I got to Narry's Cross and then I returned along some very quiet roads via Lislee and a busy main road back into Courtmacsherry.

![Main Road](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2012.52.43.jpg)


I had to take a breather there and have an ice-cream and Lucozade.

![Ice Cream](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2013.13.27.jpg)

And then the final push back to the car in Timoleague.

I fully intend to go again soon and run the entire route which is heading towards Ultra Marathon length. Well, when I say run, I mean run-walk.

The reason I wanted to write this post is that the Seven Heads walk is little more than a name for many people. It's barely a 20 minute drive from Bandon. Probably less from Clonakilty. Much of it is completely off-road with no asshole drivers. If you are looking for some of the best views in the country and a bit of exercise, you owe it to yourself to check it out.

Keep an eye out for my next post which takes this basic topic and turns it into a very long rant about the future of the country's health."
The Sheep's Head (Way) - Ambling 51 miles in 21 hours,"## The Unlockdowning
As we approached the partial lifting of pandemic lockdown in Ireland in late March 2021, I wanted to celebrate in some way that involved trails, hills and running. Luckily for me, the brilliant [Tough Soles](https://toughsoles.ie/) published a new summary video [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zcxzrr1Q_HM) of their [Sheep's Head Way hiking trip](https://toughsoles.ie/blog/2018/sheepsheadwaycork/part1) from 2018. I was immediately sold.

## The route
The [official Way web-site](http://thesheepsheadway.ie/) has a ton of useful info including a trace of the whole route. After jumping through some software hoops to convert the KML/KMZ to GPX, I soon had it on Viewranger on my phone and on my Garmin InReach. So at least I wouldn't get lost or my body would be easier to find. Here's my [GPX copy](/images/2021/04/Sheeps_Head_Way_Main_Loop.gpx) in case you want to use it.

![The Route](/images/2021/04/sheeps_head_route.png)

The main loop is 58 miles / 93 km over a variety of surfaces and terrain. It starts in Bantry at the gatehouse of Bantry House, runs mostly off-road along the north side of the peninsula until it reaches the lighthouse and then returns mostly within spitting distance of the main road on the southside, skirting Kilcrohane, Ahakista and Durrus, before ending back where it started.

## The pack
My big worry was time. Would I be able to do it all in one day or would I have to overnight it somehow? I decided to play it safe and assume I'd end up outdoors overnight in April for the first time since I was a boy scout in the 1980s. I ordered a light tent, sleeping bag and MSR gas stove online. Only the stove arrived in time, thanks to the lovely people in [Wild Side Sports](https://wildsidesports.ie/) (and less thanks to the slow-coaches in TrekkInn). 

So the weekend before was very stressful. I opted to use a Patagonia 28L commuter rucksack to carry everything and suddenly remembered I'd bought a Decathlon tarp last year in the staycation panic-buying-phase we we all in during May/June 2020. I also had an old Aldi/Lidl ultra light sleeping bag and lots of bivvy bags and space blankets. Sure I'll be grand I thought.

After packing enough stuff for an assault on K2, including food for three days. I weighed the bag. 13kg. Without water. And I was somehow going to run with this? Some major rejigging later got me to 8kg. But I was so concerned about access to water (despite including both chlorine tablets *and* a Lifestraw) that I added 3 litres in softflasks. So 11-ish kg. Heavy but possibly manageable. I added some bungees as a waist strap just in case.

![The Pack](/images/2021/04/2021-04-11-06.20.38.jpg)

## The start in Bantry
A 4.30am start in Bandon had me at the camper-van car-park in Bantry ready to go at 6.30am on April 12th. Seeing that the main gate in Bantry House was shut, I immediately had to go off-route and just headed out the N71 to get to the side-road and begin the adventure.

After 50 yards I realised I'd made a dreadful mistake with the pack. It was completely impossible to run with it. It not only weighed a ton, it also bounced all over the place and was unbalanced. So I resigned myself to power-hiking the entire thing. Or walking as normal people call it.

![The start](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-06.33.48.jpg)

One thing I noticed about the Way is that it will send you off-road whenever it can, right from the start, even when the road is reasonable. Sometimes I really liked that, particularly when there was something interesting to check out. Other times, much later, it was ""jesus, lumpy fields, again?""

![The phone](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-07.13.03.jpg)


## OMG The views
The first four miles are mostly on-road but felt completely safe with maybe two cars. Once you get off-road, you'll spend the next many hours in awe of the views. Every time you think it can't get any more beautiful, it does. Now to be fair, I picked an absolutely perfect day. Over the entire route I had 5 minutes of drizzle and maybe an hour where it got a bit too hot. Late at night in the dark was the only cold time. There were parts, as you approach the end of the peninsula, that would be terrifying in windy conditions. But for me, everything was crystal clear and fog-free with a gentle breeze.

I adored every minute of the outbound leg.

## Ireland vs The Continent
I met one Eastern European man who had the same idea as me to get as far from his 5km as he possibly could. And a couple of people near the lighthouse later who had presumably driven to the car-park near there. In fact there were more Eastern Europeans than Irish out that day, which is an interesting reflection of our respective relationships with the outdoors I think.

## Navigation
As Ellie from Tough Soles pointed out, the way-marking on this trail is incredibly good. You rarely go more than a few hundred metres without seeing the little yellow person on a pole or a rock. In decent visibility, you rarely need to refer to the electronic route and of course as long as you can see the water, you know you are roughly heading in the right direction.

![Signs 1](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-07.30.52.jpg)

I only spotted one sign pointing completely the wrong way at Glanlough when you reach the road (you turn right, not left). And two that had fallen down. Not bad for 500+ markers! At night they reflect light well, but as I describe later, that wasn't enough to save me towards the end.

![Signs 2](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-07.57.55.jpg)

To use American-lingo, I guess my mini-adventure would be considered an unsupported Thru-Hike, albeit a very short one as it's no PCT or AT. But it's still possible to get in trouble on any trail and to give my wife a degree of comfort that I'm not unconscious somewhere on the trail, I always use my [Garmin InReach Explorer](https://buy.garmin.com/en-IE/GB/p/561269) to ping the old Iridium satellite network every 15 minutes with my location. Its hardware design is like an old school Nokia N95 from 2007 but it is bullet-proof. It worked perfectly throughout the route and still had 65% battery when I checked the following day. The expensive monthly fee is worth it for peace of mind during those active months in the year. In contrast, I was very grumpy that my Garmin Forerunner 935 gave up the ghost in the last mile but I didn't have Ultra Trac mode enabled on it. Separately, I was very surprised to have perfect 4G for almost the entire northside of the route. Presumably that was due to line of sight to towns on the Beara peninsula?

## The difficulty level
That first big leg as far as Glanlough is completely family-friendly. The worst thing you can likely do is scratch your knee or get stuck in some boggy ground.

Speaking of which, the vast majority of the route was very light on the usual West Cork trail bog. I know it hasn't rained much recently but there are plenty of routes in West Cork that are permanently waterlogged. And even more unusually, the route worn into the ground by people and sheep was generally the dryest part. And in many cases, rocks or reeds have been placed down in the bad bits. I managed to get over 30 miles before submerging up to my ankle. And that's when I went off the route for a wee. 

So a huge thank you to everyone involved in maintaining the Sheep's Head Way, including all the landowners.

## The lighthouse
I slowed down quite a bit in the latter miles approaching the end of the peninsula. The ground became much more uneven and rocky and it was hard to get the nice rhythm I had going along the ridge-lines in the earlier sections.

![Cottages](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-14.40.07.jpg)

The views around the lighthouse are completely epic. In fact, I realised that I'd been grinning almost continuously for over 11 hours. I also kept saying ""holy fuck"" over and over. It really is that beautiful.

![Lighthouse](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-16.48.42.jpg)

I had my second warm meal and cup of coffee around there on the MSR stove and was glad I'd carried that particular extra weight. Of course, post-pandemic there's an actual cafe a mile up the road. I'd hoped for a bit of gentle road walking for a while after the recent roughness but it was not to be. I was sent immediately off-road after the cafe to see the old WWII look-out and trig point.

![Food](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-10.22.24.jpg)

![Trig](/images/2021/04/2021-04-12-18.06.03.jpg)

## The southside
The main thing about the return leg is that you are rarely more than 20 minutes from a house. So if things do go badly wrong you can get help easily. Mid-pandemic, I'm not sure how many people would welcome you at their door, but in an emergency of course they'd help. 

I was very glad I brought all that water as there was almost nothing out there. And again, with the pandemic I did not want to be bothering any old farmers with a request for a top-up. There were some ropy looking bog lakes and one or two streams/run-offs in the first 45 miles that I'm sure would have been safe with the Lifestraw, but I can imagine what the taste was like. Durrus was the first time I saw an actual water outlet. Maybe something to consider for the future, even in exchange for a donation to a maintenance fund?

There was a chunk of miles along old dirt tracks which were nice and easy and mostly downhill. Plenty of houses and farms too, compared to the northside. But as I approached Kilcrohane, more and more of the route was over fields that were completely churned up by cows and very hard to walk on as the ground had dried out. 

## Cowwwwwwwwwwws
Worse, I had multiple encounters with extremely exuberant herds of cows and young bulls. The first one was actually terrifying. Imagine 20+ large animals suddenly seeing you and all simultaneously barrelling at you at full tilt. I had no bloody idea cows could move that fast. I backed out to the field entrance and they all crowded around me. I could see no route around so, with running poles akimbo to make myself bigger, I started walking through them. Some of them followed me quietly, some lost their minds in fear and raced off to a safe distance. Others kicked their hind legs up like bucking broncos. Finally I got to the other side of the field, climbed the stile and breathed a huge sigh of relief.

Except that happened three more times. I realised afterwards that I was probably the first person any of them had seen, apart from the farmers, in months. They were bored out of their minds. I have to apologise to the farmer who I could hear shouting after his herd, trying to get them from one field to the next, after they'd all legged it after me.

As a mostly edge-of-townie, I still don't know how much danger I was in. I obviously know enough to watch out for small calves and giant big-bollocks bulls, but I don't know if there's a better way to deal with ""enthusiasm"" that could get you a hoof in the head.

## The dark
At this point it was now dark and the temperature plummeted. I got out the head-torches and trudged along. There wasn't a sinner to be seen in Kilcrohane itself. Once off-road again (more cows), I began to find it harder and harder to navigate. When I could see the waymarker reflections in the distance, it was fine, but when I couldn't, it was too easy to veer left or right off the ""track"". I was constantly having to stop and check [Viewranger](https://www.viewranger.com/en-gb) and started getting cold too. 

By the time I got to near Ahakista, I was running out of energy. I was now 16 hours on my feet, beating my previous record of 14 hours for the [Liverpool to Manchester 50 miler](https://conoroneill.com/2018/04/08/from-liverpool-to-manchester-conor-does-50-before-50/). So in the scrubland above the village, I decided to call it a day and try to get some shut eye. I took off my runners, got out the tarp and sleeping bag  and rolled myself up like a burrito in both.

A complete waste of time. 15 minutes of hard-ground agony and jumpy legs later, I packed it all up and started trudging again. Now I was freezing and couldn't even find the road that was clearly nearby given the house lights I could see. Eventually I climbed some barbed-wire and got on the road. 

I calculated that I was probably looking at something like another 7 hours to finish and I did not have that in me. My wife offered to collect me but I wasn't completely done yet. I did wonder if Bantry taxis ever take calls in the middle of the night to collect people from the trail :)

## Blisters, I'll show you blisters
One thing I forgot to mention was that I had hot-spots on both of my forefeet from very early on. I was wearing Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX runners which didn't have many miles in them but I've been wearing various Hokas for years and never had any issues before. These are my first Gore-Tex runners and OMG, it's incredible to not have wet feet running off-road. I can only imagine how quickly my feet would have deteriorated without the Gore-Tex. Whilst I was able to avoid the really boggy stuff, it was still very wet in many places.

But at this stage the hot-spots were raging big blisters that made every step torture. So I finally accepted that I wasn't going to finish the ""Way"" but I thought I could get back to Bantry ok if I stuck to the road and walked more on my heels.

I got to the junction in Ahakista and saw the sign ""Bantry 19km"". Some slow-brain maths later and I thought ""oh jesus that's four hours at my current pace"". 

## The Road
So that's what I did.

I met two vehicles in that entire section. I thought it would never end. I could see the lights of Durrus for hours. But some strongly worded self-talk kept me going ok. Particularly Yvon Chouinard's famous ""For me, when everything goes wrong, that's when adventure starts"".

And 21 hours after I started, I arrived back to my car grinning like an idiot.

![The End](/images/2021/04/2021-04-13-03.28.30.jpg)


## And I'm feeling good
Whilst I'm disappointed I didn't finish the Way route, I'm actually over-the-moon about a bunch of things. I've never gone so far on foot. I've never done an activity which lasted so long, I've never done any sort of night-time off-road hiking/running, I've never carried a pack that far and I've never done that many miles in the hills. I was also really happy in that first 10-12 hours with how damned good I felt. I seemed to have boundless energy. I blame all those plants I've been eating since January 2020. Whilst the Sheep's Head Way doesn't have very much ascent/descent, it's not exactly flat and I did over 7000ft of elevation.

{{< youtube Q0njKqHDVuA >}}

On a different day with tougher soles (sorry Ellie and Carl) and my usual 5L Salomon pack with a few gels and bars, I think I'd be able to run much of it and finish in daylight. I won't freak myself out by checking what FKT one of the Cork and Kerry Trail Runners mountain goats has, but I'll be happy to claim the SKT (Slowest Known Time) in the future.

## Fame
As I said afterwards on Instagram, I really do think The Sheep's Head Way should be world famous. I've lived in West Cork for 18 years and have been running for 12 years and I was only vaguely aware of it as maybe some sort of less-famous ""spur"" of the Beara Way. It's not just mind-bogglingly beautiful, it's very very runnable for huge chunks of it. 

Here's the [Relive.cc](https://www.relive.cc/) animation of the route:

<video src=""/images/2021/04/VID_124520921_072824_731.mp4"" controls></video>

I'm aiming to run anything that looks even vaguely like a trail in Cork whilst we're still in county lockdown and I suspect I may be back on The Sheep's Head again in 2021 for another go.

## Next?
In the meantime where should I try next? I've done bits of [Slí Gaeltacht Mhuscraí](http://www.sligaeltachtmuscrai.com/sgm.html) ([Tough Soles page](https://toughsoles.ie/blog/2018/4-1)) near Gougane Barra / [The Beara Way](https://www.bearabreifneway.ie/beara-way/) ([Tough Soles page](https://toughsoles.ie/blog/the-beara-way)) near Glengarriff. Are there other really good long loops you can do in Cork that are possible without needing support/lifts? And is there *anything* on Mizen? I spent a lot of last week's fun staring at it.

## Final words
So whether you are a hiker, walker, road runner, trail runner or person who just likes gorgeous views, you should get your ass to The Sheep's Head. Just leave the dogs at home, they are rightly not allowed. And make sure you leave no trace except your footprints.

Finally, once again, thank you to everyone involved in making The Sheep's Head Way such a magical and manageable route."
The Sheep's Head Way Fastest Known Time (FKT),"## If at first
On April 12th 2021 [I attempted to do](/2021/04/18/the-sheeps-head-way-ambling-51-miles-in-21-hours/) the entire main loop of [The Sheep's Head Way](http://thesheepsheadway.ie/). I didn't quite make it but had an amazing day in a wonderful part of the world. Five weeks later on May 17th, I gave it another go. Whilst it didn't go to plan, the outcome left me with a big old grin on my face for a week.

## No you don't need a gas cooker
The two main problems I had the first time were my ridiculous pack full of everything from a gas cooker to a sleeping bag, along with the horrendous blisters on the soles of my feet. This time I pulled out my usual Salomon 5L running pack, bought a ton of energy/protein bars and replaced all the sleeping/safety gear with a single mylar space blanket. So really the bulk of the weight was just a water bladder and two hydraflasks.

![Salomon Pack](/images/2021/05/salomon.jpg)

## And he's off again
I managed to get to Bantry a bit earlier and set off at 5:50am from the gatehouse of Bantry House. All of the gates were closed due to the pandemic, so as before I stuck to the main road for the first section.

![Start](/images/2021/05/start.jpg)

Yet again I picked a perfect day for it. Not too hot, not too cold, no rain. The ground was a lot wetter than the previous attempt but not a quagmire. I was still very happy with how the Goretex on the Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX worked in those conditions. I deftly dodged any deep bog and managed to keep the feet dry all day. To avoid the blisters I went completely overboard and fully taped the front half of my feet and my toes with zinc oxide tape. And it bloody worked - not a single blister in 60 miles!

## Oh oh he's down
Everything was going brilliantly well. I couldn't even feel the pack on my back and I was eagerly running the flats and the downs. 

![Dawn](/images/2021/05/dawn.jpg)

But then, as I headed downhill towards Glanlough, I stepped on to a slick slab and, whoosh, my legs flew from under me and I landed face-down on the slab on my right hip. For a split second I thought I might have gone full OAP and broken it, but as I hauled myself up, I realised it wasn't too bad. Unfortunately a few footsteps later revealed that I'd pulled something in my right knee and something in the left hip. I went from happily bouncing along to gingerly tip-toeing on anything that looked wet and making sure both running poles were firmly planted with each step. My confidence was shot.

## Only two marathons to go
Bit by bit, I ran less and less. The pain in the knee got steadily worse and made running downhill very painful. The pain in the hip matched it perfectly and made everything uphill very painful. But I was able to speedhike reasonably well. By the time I got the end of the peninsula, I was two hours up on the previous attempt. And as before I was in a great place mentally. This time I had little doubt I was going to finish, unless the knee/hip did something catastrophic.

![View](/images/2021/05/view.jpg)

It was lovely to see the cafe at the head open for business and it was hopping with people. I ran into a duo twice who were doing a shorter looped hike and got a lovely beep from them many hours later in Durrus as I click-clacked through.

## I'll have the water with bits in
The first time around I was extremely worried about the water situation and brought tons, which I didn't fully use. This time I was just as concerned and became more so as the day progressed due to the heat. Luckily the recent rain meant that all the previous rivulets were now little streams. Finally towards the end of the peninsula I decided to give it a go. I found an accessible decent sized stream with no sign of livestock and refilled one of the hydraflasks. I dropped a chlorine dioxide tablet in and waited 15 minutes for it to do its magic. And wow, it tasted fine. Not like a swimming pool or sheep's arse at all. But there were bits. Of unknown origin. 

I have to admit I bought a hydraflask with a built in filter when I got home. For the next time.

## Full-fat Coke
The last time I got to Kilcrohane, it was a ghosttown late at night. This time it was buzzing in the late afternoon and gorgeous sun. I stopped at the PostOffice/Cafe/Shop/Everything and got some fizzy water, sweets and full-fat coke. I'm not sure when we started calling the red can full-fat but it totally makes sense in my head. And it's the ultimate drink over very long distances to give you a boost.

![Coke](/images/2021/05/coke.jpg)

## Pretty pretty pretty good
Apart from the hip/knee, I was having a fantastic day. I made it to Ahakista and the spot where I had attempted to sleep in a moment of despair a month earlier. Between my increased speed and the extra daylight, it was still bright at this point and I could see that my only mistake had been going slightly off to one side and missing the very obvious track in the dark the previous time. It really reinforced how much more difficult off-road is in the dark.

This time, I was all fired-up to do the full Way properly so I kept to the official route. There is one small mistake in the Google Maps track on the website near Ahakista so you should just trust the waymarkers around there. They are correct. 

It was slow going and the aches and pains were a lot worse but overall everything was still fundamentally good. I made it to Durrus at 9.30pm and it was jammers with people. A bit of a change from 1am the previous time.

There was a dodgy road section for a few miles which I really didn't like. Fast moving cars and vans and not a hell of a lot of verge.

## Cowwwwwwssssss
After the relentless cows of the last attempt, I almost felt lonely this time. None of my scary beefy buddies were around to run towards me at full tilt. In fact on the entire route I was only in one field with cows. It was a little concerning as there were small calves with their mothers but everyone just ignored me. 

Another group clearly recognised me from across a hedge and were outraged they couldn't hang out with their bestie Conor as they ran along parallel.

Oh also, the Alpacas in Kilcrohane totally pretended I wasn't there.

## Hello darkness my old friend
The sun dropped and I pulled in to a field to add another layer, plus my light jacket, beanie and headtorch. I was starting to get stressed about the final off-road section. I had no idea how rough it would be. A few minutes later I went up a side-road and then out on to fields.

As I predicted, this was by far the hardest part of the route. The knee/hip were in a very bad way. The waymarkers were obviously much harder to find in the dark and there was a ton of up/down/up/down on mixed terrain. But at least it wasn't remotely technical or dangerous. The ups in particular were proving extremely painful. But step by step and pole by pole I clicked-clacked on. At a route fork, I even took the ""scenic route"" in the pitch dark rather than the road back to the N71.

## All roads lead to Bantry
Suddenly I found myself on the main N71 approx 10km from Bantry. Yet again there were two options. Take the main road (similar to the last time) or follow a much smaller and hillier route that ran roughly parallel. The thought of being ploughed down by some late-night driver worried me enough that I took the latter option.

The first section was much better than I expected. It was just a forest road which became a tiny lane, then a tiny road, then a bigger road and finally a decent regional road into Bantry. But jesus the hills. They were killing me. It felt like I was barely moving. Each step became more and more painful. If it wasn't for those Black Diamond Carbon FLZ poles, I would have been a goner many hours before. I somehow managed to avoid hand blisters too.

## You're nearly there
That hilarious sign you see at every marathon which gives you murderous thoughts suddenly popped into my head. Even tho I was a few hundred yards from the start/finish spot, the route veers away and back towards Bantry House. The pandemic gate situation meant I had to go even further away and back onto the N71 footpath to retrace my initial steps in reverse.

A cop car passed by slowly. I have no doubt the word ""nutter"" was uttered quietly. 

I passed my own parked car and step by awful step I made it back to the gatehouse. And done.

60.64 miles (97.6km) in 21:31:08 finishing at almost 3.30am.

I took a minute. I may have grinned like the aforementioned nutter for another minute or so.

Here's a slightly ropy Google Earth flyover of the route:

## Fastest Known Time (FKT)
I'm a big fan of the US [FKT](https://fastestknowntime.com/) thing. It's a nice bottom-up way of creating a bit of competition amongst people and highlighting trails and routes that may not be very well known. As a concept it hasn't really caught on in Ireland yet. I suspect the incredible [Iveragh Traverse](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1328420757249671/permalink/4023865234371863/) by Kevin Leahy and Joe O’Leary may change that. 

So, for fun and maybe to goad some serious runners into doing a serious time on The Sheep's Head Way, I submitted my time/route and it was accepted! So I now have the [""official"" Fastest Known Time on The Sheep's Head Way](https://fastestknowntime.com/fkt/conor-oneill-sheeps-head-way-ireland-2021-05-18). I figure any member of [IMRA/MMRA](https://imra.ie/events/) could easily do it twice as fast. Go on, you know you want to.

Garmin version of [route here](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/6798090213). [Strava here](https://www.strava.com/activities/5315312089).

Sidenote: [Please donate a few quid](https://fundit.ie/project/1000-km-of-chaos) to get [1000 KM of Chaos](https://vimeo.com/500936959) made. It's a movie about Kevin.

## Unsupported vs Self-Supported
My plan for the route had been to do it unsupported. This means no help from anyone and you carry everything in your pack except for optionally getting water in streams etc. And I almost did that. Except for Kilcrohane. Getting those few bits in the shop, which I really didn't need, except maybe mentally, resulted in it not being an Unsupported FKT, it's a Self-Supported one.

Obviously it's the kind of safe short route that almost anyone could do Unsupported.

## The Aftermath
So what happens to a 53 year old body after doing two and a bit marathons on a dodgy knee and a dodgy hip? Well he's tired for a week. And then he gets vaccinated with J&J a week later and is doubly floored. 

But the knee is the real problem. Here I am three weeks later and I can't do more than a mile before it flares up viciously with pain on the outside. Doctor Google says I have IT Band Syndrome which sounds right. But three weeks doing little more than walking and it hasn't really improved at all. The hip glitches a bit but is clearly getting better every day. 

Weirdly, a 3 mile run on the Seven Heads was very sore whilst a 12 mile hike with my wife on a [shorter Sheep's Head loop](https://www.strava.com/activities/5425613675) was completely pain free the following day.

What the hell am I moaning about? 97km in one day and ooh my knee is a bit sore! That's a result by any measure.

## Final words
Finally, as I said the last time, thank you to everyone involved in making The Sheep's Head Way such a magical and manageable route."

The Your Sinclair Rock n Roll Years 1985 now available,"Unless the name Matthew Smith means something to you and you get a wee tingle when the words ""Manic Miner"" are uttered, then you are probably not interested in the rest of this post.

But, [YSNRY 1985](http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tvprog/downloads.htm) is finally with us just in time for christmas. This is the latest in a very very special (to Speccy fanatics like myself) series of animated ""movies"" about the hey-day years of 'Your Sinclair/Your Spectrum' magazine, an esteemed journal which published two games by yours truly back in 1985/1986!

It really is worth checking out all of the episodes if you ever had a Speccy or even a (spit) Commodore 64, Vic-20, Jupiter Ace, Oric-1, BBC Micro, Electron, ZX81, ZX80 or Enterprise/Elan/Flan. Do the author a favour tho and use bittorrent to download.

Some kind soul with an enormous amount of spare time has scanned in all the issues of Your Sinclair and Your Spectrum. Conor's works of genius (being ""The Grid"" and ""The Cherry Run"") in pure Z80 assembler can be viewed in all their JPEG glory below.

There goes my Blogging by Telegram money-spinning idea,"Will I ever get the my timing right?

""[What God had wrought](http://jwz.livejournal.com/595551.html)"" courtesy of JWZ"
There is something you don't know.  I am not left-handed,"Finally got around to collecting together the list of other bits of software I use (mainly at home). But first off, I should be given a thorough thrashing for not including XEmacs in the first list.

I first encountered XEmacs on HP-UX in Philips Eindhoven in 1995\. Up until then I had used the VAX editor and a few crappy freeware PC ones. This thing was a revelation - syntax highlighting, tons of extensions, call-out to make, gcc, whatever. Built-in games for the love of god. It instantly became my favourite tool of all time.

When I got back to S3 I found it installed on SunOS, except it looked shit - very few menu items, awful scroll-bars etc. Then I found out about the schism between Emacs and XEmacs and discovered that the one in S3 was Emacs. In Integral Design, after getting gcc, popper and Samba installed on the Solaris boxes, XEmacs was my very next install.

Then the beauties hacked it to compile on Cygwin, then (heart palpitations), they got it to natively compile on Windows. It was my main development platform (and platform is not an exaggeration) until about 2001 when the amount of programming I did reduced to almost nothing.

But recently I re-discovered my old friend, still clunky on Windows, still unbelievably powerful. I must fish out my highly optimised .emacs file from a few years back and start using it again. In the past few weeks I have used it to edit Perl, Java and C++. Not great as an IDE anymore in comparison to Eclipse or Netbeans but for straight-up coding, you can't beat it.

Back to the list:

XEmacs 21.5 B17  - See above
DivX Player  - handy MPEG4 player
Hello - Odd but interesting tool. Handy for sending pictures to Blogger
Picasa - Fantastic picture management tool
Nokia PC Suite - My 6230 would be useless without it
Quickpay - Run my payroll on this. Pretty rubbish but functional
Sage Instant Accounts - Run my accounts on this. Hate it but it works (barely)
Skype - Looks good. Don't know anyone else who has it, so kinda like the first guy with a fax.
Unison - Great for syncing directories
VLC Media Player - Good for playing lots of formats. Won't work with my PVR-350 yet tho!
xplorer2 - Good dual-pane Windows explorer replacement
ZXSpin - Excellent Spectrum Emulator
EmuZWin - Ditto
AutoIT v3 - Extremely powerful scripting tool for Windows Admin.
Fresh Download - Free Download accelerator
Fresh UI - Free Windows UI modifier (e.g. DOS Prompt here in the context menu)
DVD Shrink - Every DVD I buy gets processed by this. The kids are given the copies to destroy with their greasy fingers and the originals are kept pristine. A must-have tool."
There's nothing worse than being an aging young person,"I don't want this blog to turn into a list of great people who have died, but I've just read that Richard Pryor has passed away.

Think you can review something in 140 characters or less?,"Then LouderTweets are for you. 

After a few late nights we're now ready to let you send reviews from Twitter to LouderVoice. We're calling them LouderTweets and they are 140 character mini-reviews you can send using Web, SMS or IM via Twitter to LouderVoice. 

So far we've had reviews of chocolate, couscous, a conference, a lawnmower and many others. Make your Tweets Louder!

An important point is that **you don't have to be a LouderVoice member to send LouderTweets** but you should join if you want to rate, bookmark and build/share useful collections of reviews and mini-reviews.

And how do you send LouderTweets as a Twitter user? It's very simple:

1.  Add the Twitter ""review"" user [as a friend here](http://twitter.com/review)
2.  Wait until you get a confirmation that you have been added back as a friend
3.  Post reviews using this format on Twitter:  @review RATING ITEM. REVIEW
4.  Example:   @review 4 The Apprentice UK. A stonkingly good series that has thrown up plenty of surprises
5.  That format is very specific otherwise we won't pick up the review. Rating is in the range 1-5\. Full-stop/Period mandatory.
6.  Shortly afterwards that review can be found by searching on www.loudervoice.com (in an open community microformat called hreview)

You can see an example here:

Tweet: [http://twitter.com/oldchapel/statuses/101344802](http://twitter.com/oldchapel/statuses/101344802)
LouderVoice: [http://www.loudervoice.com/search?q=tesco+chocolate](http://www.loudervoice.com/search?q=tesco+chocolate)

As with all tweets, you can send your review tweet using whatever tool you like: web-page, Google GTalk, SMS, Tweetr etc

Think your killer recipe would sell in a supermarket?,"Aisling from RTE in Cork contacted a bunch of Irish bloggers about a new show they are doing. I'm thrilled she did, considering it's exactly what I recommended only a few weeks ago in the context of my ""Heat"" review.

The idea is simple, it's a 6 part competition show called Recipe for Success that will see 15 home cooks battle it out to have their own gastronomic creations stocked on the shelves of SuperValu. Viewers of the series will see the whole development process of the product.

![](http://www.rte.ie/tv/recipeforsuccess/images/recipeforsuccess.jpg ""Recipe for Success"")

I honestly think this is the smartest idea for a food programme that RTE has had since they spotted the potential of Darina Allen all those years ago. I can't wait to see how you take a home-cooked meal and turn it into a shelf-ready product.

If you have a dish you know people love and which has the potential to be packaged, why not give this a go? SuperValu already stocks the wonderful Cully and Sully range so the precedent for high-end ready-meals is there.

The question is, would my Sophie Grigson derived (but still unique) [meatballs](http://conoroneill.com/2005/09/19/meatballs-in-tomato-sauce/) make the cut or would potential customers just lump it into the same category as the dreaded B***s E*e Spag Bol in a bag (which I ate many times in college)? Sadly my [Chicken Tikka](http://conoroneill.com/2006/10/13/conors-ultra-secret-chicken-tikka-masala-recipe/), whilst amazing, is just a straight lift from a book.

This heavy guy decided to run the London Marathon and you won't believe what happened next.,"I figured it was either that title or ""5 ways you can run the London Marathon without even trying"" ;-)

If you'd told me in 2008 that I'd ever run a 10k, I'd have laughed at you. If you'd told me in 2009 that I'd ever run a half marathon, I'd have laughed at you. If you'd told me in 2011 that I'd ever run a marathon, I'd have laughed at you. If you'd told me in 2014 that I'd ever run two marathons in 5 weeks, I'd have laughed at you. You get my point.

I [blogged two years ago](http://conoroneill.com/2013/01/02/three-full-years-a-running-and-my-first-marathon/) about the Dublin Marathon and I thought that was the last time I'd ever mention a marathon. I've done several half marathons and 10k runs since but at the back of my mind I wondered if I'd ever give 26.2 miles another go.

I had an abortive attempt at training for Dublin 2014 but then in December my wife suggested we do London. Initially I thought no. If I was ever to do it, I'd want to lose 5 stone and be ultra fit so I'd do it in a time to be proud of. But I thought about it more and realised I could be dead long before then. As a Carpe Diem kind of person it just made sense to do it. So our Christmas present to each other was entry to the 2015 London Marathon (via the absolutely superb [Sports Travel International](http://sportstravelinternational.com/)).

Training went well as I lost 1.5 stone, upped my speeds and experimented with various minimal-drop non-Five-Fingers running shoes. Then we realised in early March that some travel and Easter would mess up the training schedule. I was following the London Intermediate schedule which meant that 22 miles was the peak training distance but I wouldn't be around to do that weekend.

So we decided to throw caution to the wind and do the Tralee Marathon for ""practice"". One reason I was a big fan of this idea was that I could make all the mistakes and deal with all the worry in Tralee. It was a very small race of fewer than 400 people and I came 8th last in a time of 5:45. Most of the slowness was caused by my walking up the hills of the second half. But I was happy because it was very doable, I didn't destroy my body and I didn't lose my mind!

Now London felt totally manageable and I wasn't stressed at all. I upped my speed some more in the final weeks to see if I could crack 5 hours in London. I gave up on using the New Balance MR00 and I could not get comfortable in a new pair of MR10 so my old knackered worn-heel pair of MR10 were chosen.

Finally the day came. A 6am wake-up and we arrived at the start area by coach with over two hours to wait. The crowds of runners just built and built. The announcer said that 38000 people were due to start. I couldn't even imagine how many people that is! The adrenalin began to flow and the wind, drizzle and cool temperature did nothing to reduce my enthusiasm. Hot tea and coffee was an unusual but much appreciated aid.

At 10am I shed my Christmas jumper and lined up the podcasts on my phone. Catherine headed to the faster zone and I went to the rear. At 10:10 I started RunKeeper and the shuffle to the start line began. As soon as we crossed the line, I began running and had none of the predicted start-stop that London is infamous for.

![Marathon Start Line](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/conor_marathon_start.jpg)

The next 5 hours and 40 minutes were like nothing I've ever experienced in my life. I'm going to struggle to describe just how it felt. If you've heard that the crowds in London are great then you still haven't the vaguest idea of what the people of London do for the Marathon. It's on an epic scale. Imagine 26.2 miles of people all lined up on both sides of the roads winding through London all cheering shouting, banging, singing, playing and dancing. And all of that energy is targeted at you. Non stop. It's a completely transcendent experience. At times I felt like I wasn't running and they were just carrying my sore legs along. I came close to tears on Tower Bridge with the location and the ""moment"". I nearly lost it completely at mile 23 with the emotional impact of all the crowds and the music and the pain and the encouragement.

I don't know London well, I've never worked there. My semi-regular visits have never really given me a feeling for the place. On Sunday I think I saw the real London. I saw the soul of an amazing city. Where every area from the poorest to the richest was loudly willing you to succeed. Where everyone from the most ultra athlete to overweight people blobs like me were given the same encouragement and love from hundreds of thousands of people for 6 hours plus.

Crossing that line is a life moment that's now burned into my mind forever.

![Marathon Finish Line](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/conor_marathon_finish_line.jpg)

I've run races in Amsterdam, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry and Wexford. I've watched my wife run more in Paris and Rome. None of them, none, come even close to what happened on the streets of London. My time is irrelevant, you can't measure the effect that day had on me.

I now finally know why many people rate it as the greatest of all the major marathons. It's got nothing to do with the route. It's taking part in an incredible experience.

![Marathon End](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/conor_marathon_end.jpg)

This is Masterchef not Master Scallops,"It's time to put Masterchef out to pasture. I'm watching an average show in about 10 minutes using Sky+. The formula isn't working any more. No tension, no excitement, the same stupid catchphrases. Cooking doesn't get any harder than this. Yeah, it does.

Scallops. If I see one more bleedin scallop on that show, I'll explode. Fabio Viviani, in the far superior US show Top Chef, described the same problem perfectly back in January 2009:

And to prove the point yesterday, whilst bent over double in pain from a tummy bug, I lashed this together in 5 minutes, and I'm not even a good cook!

This should be bigger news - Gizmo offering free PC to landline calls,"Most people, even non-techies like my Dad, have heard of [Skype ](http://www.skype.com/)at this stage. Skype gives you free PC-to-PC ""phone"" calls and allows you to ring normal international phone numbers for much cheaper than normal phone-to-phone calls. I've used it a lot and it works pretty well. 

But Skype has a much less well-known competitor called [Gizmo ](http://www.gizmoproject.com/)and you'd be nuts not to give them a try. Gizmo, unlike Skype, is built on a standard called SIP so it works with all other SIP-based products e.g. VOIP products that cable TV customers in the USA use. It also doesn't chew up your PC like Skype can do.

Gizmo's feature set has always been far better than Skype including conference calling from day 1, call recording, voicemail etc. I have always found the voice quality to be better too. It's biggest drawback has always been the lack of uptake so that I have never done a PC-to-PC call with it since no-one I know uses it.

Recently they unveiled a killer feature. Any two Gizmo users can now do [PC-to-phone calls for free](http://www.gizmoproject.com/learnmore-allcallsfree.html). All you have to both be is signed up for Gizmo, only one of you actually needs to be at a computer. This is available in 60 countries including Ireland right now and even works for mobile numbers in a bunch of them too (not Ireland yet sadly). I've tested it and it works perfectly. If you make lots of national or international calls and don't mind doing them from your computer, you could save a ton of money with this. If you have a [VOIP phone or Router](http://www.sipphone.com/adapters/), then you may not even need to be at the computer! I need to investigate this more.

Check them out, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

We put Kartik (an American based in Sacramento) into shock when we were out for a pint last week in Framingham. He asked the three paddies at the table if they had kids. The count was Donagh 4, Denis 4, Conor 3 plus one on the way. And they say the Irish are having fewer babies......."

Three full years a-running and my first Marathon,"I thought I'd have a quick peek at my running stats this morning. Last year was pretty good and I've managed to start 2013 a whole 6 lbs lighter than I started 2012\. Having said that, lots and lots of weight to be lost this year.

I started ""running"" back in 2009\. It was not an auspicious beginning.

**2009**

*   28.43km
**2010**

*   435.81km
*   Timoleague: First 10km
*   Half Marathons: Dingle, Galway
**2011**

*   394.39km
*   First road race in Vibram Five Fingers
*   Half Marathons: Bandon, Amsterdam

*   849.41
*   10kms: Bandon
*   Half Marathons: Cork, Clonakilty
*   First Marathon: Dublin
**2013**

*   Second Marathon: Location TBD
I never did a blogpost on the Dublin Marathon. Must have been the mental scars :-) So here we go:

After the Cork Half in June, I stated, as I always do, that I simply don't have a marathon in me. But over July I thought more and more about it and finally, after a lot of egging on by my wife, signed-up to do the Dublin City Marathon.

I decided to follow the official training guide for a nice slow 5+ hour run. I was starting a month late but I figured the Cork Half training was an acceptable substitute. Overall training went very well even if the loop around Bandon does get a bit boring after the 3rd time in a day. Hopefully we'll get a path all the way out to the railway path some time this decade. My schedule peaked at an 18 mile run which was very slow but gave me a huge boost in confidence.

The day of the Marathon was quite chilly and we did the short walk up from the Mespil with windbreakers on. I was totally planking it. Despite lots of attempts at warm-up, I was very cold at the start, particularly my poor Vibram clad feet. And then we were off.

I decided to err on the side of total caution and went very slowly around Stephen's Green and up O'Connell St. All felt good heading up to NCR and into the Phoenix Park. The Park is the longest and most boring part of the run. My right calf started to feel tight about half way through it. By the time I got to Chapelizod Gate, I was in serious trouble. The calf hurt more and more. The pain behind my knee getting worse with every step.

I finally took a breather heading up to Kilmainham around mile 10 and walked up some hills. Walking was no better. And that was the rest of my Marathon. A mixture of walking, slow jogging and a tiny bit of running, barely able to extend my right leg at all. All my attempts to compensate ended up hurting shin muscles and then my left leg. Pure bloody torture.

But here's the amazing thing. At no point did I think I wouldn't finish. Knowing all of the second half of the route inside-out was a huge help. I could just tick off sections in my head. Walkinstown, KCR, Terenure, Milltown, etc. That stubborn part of my brain simply decided that if it was going to take 8 hours, it was going to take 8 hours, even if I had to do it on all fours. I have [Scott Jurek's book](http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Run-Ultramarathon-Greatness-ebook/dp/B005OCHOZS) to thank for a lot of that mental attitude. If he can run 100 miles with his ankle held together with duct tape, I can do a jog around Dublin.

The worst part was coming on to Merrion Road. The downhill on Nutley wasn't bad and I jogged most of it but then I tried to walk on Merrion and saw that long long road stretching out in front of me and I wobbled mentally. So I stuck my headphones in for the first time and put on some Kermode and Mayo movie reviews to distract me. Then RunKeeper told me I was doing &lt; 3 miles an hour. And I had more than 3 miles to go. Another hour of torture awaited me. So I bit the bullet and started jogging again. My speed was barely above walking. In fact many walkers passed me.

But on I went. And I got to the bloody end. 6 hours and 32 minutes after I began.

And the first thought as I crossed the finish line, apart from wanting to bawl crying, was ""right, the next one is going to be a **lot** faster"".

_Epilogue_ (In the best tradition of The Streets of San Francisco): Catherine had to help me get to a taxi and back to the hotel. I then peeled off the Vibrams and discovered I didn't have a single blister. Not a one. Crippled but blister free.

6 weeks later I did the Clonakilty Half. Still some aches and pains from Dublin but otherwise a grand run which proved that I hadn't damaged anything irreparably.

Now we are planning our next one. We're signed up for Berlin but that's a long way away. London looks great but is pricey. Copenhagen looks fantastic in May but may be too hot (and pricey).

The training begins tomorrow.

UPDATE 1: I decided to go for a short 3 mile run this evening. Very sore achilles but bloody hell, managed to do my [all-time fastest average speed over any distance](http://runkeeper.com/user/conoro/activity/139189568). 2013 is off to a great start!"
Tim Nice But Dim,"Well it was obvious since Paul was fired but what a disappointment. Tim has not excelled once in the entire series of [The Apprentice](http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/). Can you think of one thing he did where you went ""wow""? The series for me consists of some great scenes involving Paul, James and Saira.

But maybe that's what Sugar wants - an average MOR guy who won't challenge him and will do what he is told. However that is not the sort of manager who replaces you when you retire. But I guess Sugar Jr will get that job.

I've noticed that with strong leaders I've worked with over the years. The sort of people they hate are people exactly like themselves. Fatal flaw.

Roll on Series 2\. Hopefully they'll find some women who have a clue and spend more than a fiver getting their hair coloured every month. Meow."
Time for my bi-annual political post,"At this stage I'm sick to the back teeth of the moral relativism that passes for liberal thought in modern Europe and particularly in Ireland. Recent events in the Middle East have just amplified the noise. So it is a joy to read something as reasoned and balanced as [Norm Geras' post on what is happening in Lebanon](http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2006/07/the_rights_and_.html). Read the questions at the end very carefully and maybe you'll learn something about yourself from your answers. 

I'm surprised that so many of the old left in Britain have been able to move to a place politically where I can agree with much of what they say. It is a pity that the Irish left can still be found associating themselves with Ba'athist-hugging scumbags like George Galloway or Pol Pot groupies like Noam Chomsky.

Time to build a Cork Computer History Museum,"We have buildings all over Cork, empty. We have a recession. The hospitality industry is crippled. We need something that encourages tourism, makes use of some of that property and points the way to the future.

Can I suggest a Cork Computer History Museum?

What's one of the biggest attractions in Silicon Valley? [The Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/)

What's one of the biggest tourist draws in London? [The Science Museum](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/).

What's one of Cork's main tourist attractions now? [The Butter Museum](http://www.corkbutter.museum/).

Where is the biggest cluster of successful tech companies outside of Dublin? Cork.

Randy Jordan [has assembled](http://www.branedy.net/?page_id=305) one of the most incredible collections of classic computers anywhere. From IMSAI to Osborne to DEC PDP and Apple Lisa, he has it. Randy has offered the collection to be housed by those who should jump at the chance. They didn't get it. 

Those of us who do _get_ it have despaired when talking to Randy about his computers and the fact that they are almost never seen. The mini-collection he showed today at [BarCamp Cork III](http://www.barcampcork.com/) blew our minds.

Watch this video:

{{< youtube rXDl_LgYpcw >}}

Then think about the thousands of people who fly in and out of Cork every week and work for tech companies. Think about the brilliant but now sadly delayed idea of transforming the Cork docklands into a new tech hub. Think about all those tourists looking for something different. This could be the first step. A building full of technology that shows us the past so we can figure out the future.

Do you have a building lying idle and a vision for where you want Cork to be in 10 years time? Step up to the plate."
Timoleague to Courtmacsherry and initial impressions of Elephone Explorer Pro,"One of my fave things to do is watch videos made by Ultra Marathon runners and videographers. The views are always stunning and instantly make me want to go out for a run. My first attempt to do similar in Run Forest Run was a bit of a disaster as the rain killed my phone.

We've had an action camera for a few years that my bro-in-law kindly gave us. It's a Contour GPS. I love the GPS aspect of it but the lack of a screen, the weirdness with the bluetooth and the inability to use SD cards bigger than 2GB meant we didn't use it much.

I wanted to get something new but didn't want to dish out $499 for a GoPro Hero 4 (and now 5) when I might not use it that much. I was very impressed by the reviews of the Yi 2 but that's still $279. There are a ton of <$100 ones on all of the Chinese sites with SJCam probably being the best known, but the video quality in general looked horrendous.

Then 2 weeks ago whilst checking out some recent ones on Gearbest, I found the [Elephone Explorer Pro](http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_314991.html). Unlike most of the other brands, these seem to be a serious company with a range of phones too. The various review and unboxing videos I found all looked pretty good and if they are telling the truth, they are using a Sony sensor with a Novatek NTK96660 chipset.

![Elephone Explorer Pro](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/elecam_03.jpg)

Of course I'm not clueless and ignored the 4K claims. It's just 1080p scaled up. But I was happy to go for 1080p60 on a device that cost less than $100 and came with all the bits you'd want like a waterproof case.

I made the rookie error of using DHL delivery, so of course it got caught in Irish customs and I had to pay VAT and Import duty of more than €30 but it's still good value.

Today it had it's first outing as I ran the lovely route from Timoleague to Courtmacsherry and back. I took multiple video clips and photos.

Main thoughts:

* Damn it's small! I love that

![Small](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/elecam_01.jpg)


* No problem taking a 32GB SD Card
* The remote control is great and has different buttons for video and stills
* I zip-tied the remote control to the selfie-stick (the stick makes video less wobbly)
* The screen is rubbish so it's hard to see in sunlight whether video is recording or not
* There is a status led but it's tiny so it doesn't help
* The waterproof case seems great but I haven't tried it properly
* The bunch of adapters is also great but the back-mount is strange since it has a camera mount, not a GoPro one
* It seems to be roughly the same size as a GoPro Hero 3/4 and I could 3D print a case for it

![Case](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/elecam_02.jpg)


* I hope I forgot to charge the battery fully since it barely did 20 mins of recording before dying (will test more)
* Images aren't bad

* 170 degree view is good
* The video below was taken with it in the waterproof case. I don't know how much of an effect that has, apart from all the JJ Abrams lens flare. You can decide yourself if it's good enough. I had the ""gyroscope"" feature enabled which seemed to help with wobble.

However, comparing to the source, that generated file is much lower quality. Most of the pixellation seems to have been caused by Pinnacle Studio, rather than YouTube. 

[One of the source files](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016_1002_101235_007.MP4) for comparison.

UPDATE 1: I did another run on the Lusitania Trail this morning and it's proven that the battery is a bad joke. From full charge I got 10 minutes recording time whilst it was powered up for one hour, before it shut down with low battery. That's completely useless. I'll be asking for a replacement battery from GearBest now as hopefully it's not a design flaw in the camera. I'll post the video footage later.

UPDATE 2: Looking at the video quality from today's run, it's pretty rubbish, even before Pinnacle pixellates it. Everything is either burnt out or too dark and its all blurry. I just compared it to some footage I took of the same location on the old Contour GPS a few months ago and the 5 year old Contour kicks its ass.

So do I have a dud camera or are my settings wrong or is this as good as it gets for <$100?"
Tips for Father's Day,"The traditional Mother's Day treat in our house is to get a nice simple poached eggs on toast breakfast in bed which the kids can easily help with. This year, as wifey is up the pole, soft eggs were a no-no and hard poached eggs are pooh, so we needed an alternative.

On Saturday, in a flash of inspiration I checked out ""[Easy Entertaining](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1856265188/qid=1143492966/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-1343368-7669252)"" by [Darina Allen](http://www.cookingisfun.ie/). My lovely parents got this for me at Christmas. The ""Darina"" bit would make it instantly interesting to me, but the ""Entertaining"" bit would put me off. The only entertaining we do is giving people a laugh with our uncontrollable demon children in SuperValu when we go shopping. But this is a great book. Tons of very manageable recipes ranging from 5-minuters to multi-hour slow-cookingers. What I had remembered was her particularly good brunch chapter.

I found ""Buttermilk pancakes with crispy bacon and maple syrup"". Wife looked very happy when I suggested it.

I did a bit of shopping with the two eldest for basics in SuperValu. I got the special bits in [Urru ](http://www.urru.ie/)(sadly lacking in Mother's day specific treats for some reason) and we were all set.

The pancakes were a doddle to make and I'm completely incompetent at baking (yes, pancakes are baking in my world). These were paired with [Gubbeen ](http://www.gubbeen.com/)streaky bacon which has a very distinctive and enticing aroma (is it the juniper?). Canadian Maple Syrup finished it off. Wife rated it as the best Mother's Day breakfast ever. Result.

Dinner was our old reliable spaghetti n meatballs as we wanted us all eating at the same time. All plates were demolished. I then rolled out my secret weapon - [Murphy's Chocolate Ice Cream](http://www.murphysicecream.ie/) with [Glenilen Raspberry Mousse](http://www.glenilen.com/). Catherine argued with me that they did not go together. As far as she was concerned I was ruining a perfect chocolate moment with fruit. I disagreed and insisted she try the combo. Success, she loved it! They are effing fabulous together. I'm not even that big a fan of chocolate ice-cream but with the fluffy mousse it was awesome.

One downside was that both Oisín and Oscar tried some of the ice-cream. They both adored it  - Ois licked his bowl, Osc licked the carton clean. There goes our cost base - they won't accept HB Neapolitan from us any more.

I know what I want for Father's Day.

Tis the season for Milk Tray and cadbury's chocolate fingers,"A big Merry Christmas to all my readers, most of whom are currently co-located with me in the sitting room in Kilkenny. We're having a grand old time in Kilk. All of us are down now except for Emer's gang who will arrive tomorrow morning. We've just assembled the various christmas presents and all of the kids are happily asleep having dreams of Mario Kart DS, Barbie Scooters, Leapad Walkers and Power Rangers. We're nothing if not an international purchasing family.

For friends who are wondering about the meet-up on the 29th, drop me a line at cwjoneill&nbsp;&nbsp; at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gmail&nbsp;&nbsp; dot&nbsp;&nbsp; com for details. Looks like it will be a decent turn-out and we're already looking forward to the Quigley's stories of alligator wrestling and dingo fiddling from down under.

Tomorrow should be a blast. The boys will probably turn their noses up at all of the lovely food that Rose cooks for them. Sibéal will probably try to eat the entire turkey single-handed. As long as I get to see Willy Wonka, I'll be happy.

Shockingly, it looks like I won't be taking the pledge since I am now drinking a lovely glass of Merlot as I write. But moderation shall be the order of the day (a bottle at dinner followed by a bottle for the movies).

Everyone writes their highlights of the year. We have plenty but none comes anywhere close to the arrival of Fionn, the bestest and fattest baby in the whole wide world. He is a star. 

Ok,one thing might come close - Oisín took part in the gaelscoil's playschool christmas show last week. All of the little 4-year old angels were singing ""Realty realty suas sa spéir"", Oisín on the other hand was shouting ""hey pooh pooh head, I'm gonna hit myself"", punched himself in the head and threw himself onto the stage. I can't believe I missed this, Catherine had to be embarrased and stifle laughs simultaneously all on her own. One of the neighbours has it on camcorder, I have to get my hands on it. I do believe we have the next Larry Olivier on our hands.

Hopefully I'll catch up on all of the intended blogging over the next few days.

I planted a ton of lettuces, scallions, rocket, radishes and carrots. Nothing, not one fecking thing grew. I've never had total failure like that. Strangely, weeds are thin on the ground too. When it was built they said they put in rotted manure in the base. Any chance that is to blame? Or are the birds + slugs + local cats able to destroy every seed I planted?

Yesterday I stuck in some squash plants, tomato plants, basil and broccoli that I had been growing in the shed. I actually did the seeds months ago but the lack of light has matched my lack of activity and they are just perfect now for planting. Maybe they'll all die too. I also took all the half used packets of salad seeds and scattered them willy-nilly. The zero-effort guide to gardening continues."

Tough as Leather - The Story of Sporting Legend John Lenihan,"Finally a book review on the blog. I'm not sure where I heard about this book, probably Twitter, but damn it's a great story. I'd never heard of John Lenihan until 3 weeks ago. Then I read this [Irish Times article](http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/tough-as-leather-john-lenihan-the-conqueror-of-carrauntoohil-1.2273089) and my jaw was on the floor. He has not only won the Carrauntoohil mountain race 19 times, he still holds the record of 1 hour 11 minutes and 43 seconds. Read that again. Up and down the highest mountain in Ireland in 1:11:43. Holy shit the man is a running machine.

![Tough as Leather](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/CsLX2RxWAAUssQO.jpg)

His story is genuinely interesting and he comes across as a honourable talented hard-working man who will probably never get the adulation he deserves. The writing itself is very pedestrian but that's ok, the story is strong enough to carry it. A recommended read if you have any interest in running, striving or making hard choices. You can [buy it on Book Depository](http://www.bookdepository.com/Tough-Leather-John-Lenihan/9781782805045)."
Traffic Lights on Food - give me patience.,"It appears the opposition parties have started their campaign to lose the next general election with their latest himbo/bimbo scheme which they picked up from the UK. They want traffic lights on food to indicate the levels of salt, sugar and fat. Not only are the stuck in the 1980's with the fat obsession, but they show such a basic mis-understanding of human nature that the scheme was obviously devised by a marxist.

If I want to buy fat-laden, carb-laden, salt-laden Tayto, I bloody will and they chances of me looking at some insulting graphics are zero. When I smoked, you could have put pictures of sliced open cancerous lungs on the box and I'd happily have puffed away.

Information is only useful to those seeking it. If we want nutrition information then we'll use the amazing human ability to read to find out what is in the box. ""oh but people don't know what a safe level of salt is, so our traffic light system will enable them to figure this out without actually ever having to think"". ""Next year, we'll be bringing in a system which does an instant analysis of your blood and won't let you buy anything with too much salt or sugar"".

I was pleasantly surprised that FF told the opposition to get a clue and that they would not be bringing in such a scheme.

The first political party which starts a campaign to destroy the ever growing nanny state gets my vote.

Tre Cime di Lavaredo - A European wonder hiding in plain sight,"## I got those Pandemic City Blues
Four weeks ago I'd never heard of [Tre Cime di Lavaredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tre_Cime_di_Lavaredo). Last weekend we hiked around it and I'm still struggling to find the English to describe the beauty of what we saw. How we got there is kind of a funny story. 

We humans have an ability to let trauma fade, which helps us in countless ways from childbirth and broken limbs to the death of loved ones. It strikes me that many of us have already forgotten just how awful things were in April, May and June 2020. The extreme lockdown in Ireland achieved its aims but I particularly remember those three months being the hardest of all mentally. And for others, it was far far worse than that.

Whilst I love doing my trail runs and little hikes, I'm a total neophyte to the wider world of hiking and mountaineering. Apart from reading [Chris Bonington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bonington) books in the Kilkenny City library as a kid and watching Free Solo, I know nothing.

## London Mountain Film Festival (LMFF)
By late April I was looking for any distraction from the relentless nothingness of the same loops over and over and over on the local roads. But somehow, possibly via the BBC Adventure Show or similar, I read about the [London Mountain Film Festival](https://www.londonmountainfestival.com/) (LMFF) on Twitter and signed up to stream the movies/documentaries to break the boredom.

I'd already watched the lovely [Paddy O'Leary's Coming Home](https://vimeo.com/406878212) and I recognised some names like ledgebags Ultra Damo and Beth Pascall [doing Cape Wrath](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wrath-Beth-Pascall/dp/B08HZ87SKD). But most of it was completely new to me. And what a wonderful set of movies, shorts and documentaries it proved to be. For a change I was crying tears of joy watching Mel Nicholls in [Dream Big](https://vimeo.com/370039186), Trevor Kennison in [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hiwfuyy4v0) and ""The East German Ladies Swimming Team"" in [The Home For Broken Toys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11277452/).

But there was so many, I never got to the end. Maybe once a month I have been dipping in over the past year+ and each one has been a gem. 

This brings us up to mid September 2021. Our wedding anniversary was coming up and, like many people, we hadn't had a proper holiday in two years. We decided to treat ourselves and book the Cliff House Hotel in Ardmore for a night along with the vegan tasting menu. 

## Dolomite is my name and 
A few days later, I was doing another dip into the LMFF playlist and I discovered this odd long documentary called [The Great Peak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqDFds6N1To). For a start it's in subtitled German. It opens with an older guy who has spectacular hair. I recognise him from maybe one of the Kílian Jornet documentaries. It turns out he is [Reinhold Messner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Messner) and is one of the greatest mountaineers ever, having done things like the first solo ascent of Everest!

Reinhold is talking about a very special set of peaks in the Dolomite Mountains called Drei Zinnen. The camera pans to show them and my jaw hits the floor. As I said in the opener, I don't have the vocabulary to describe them. Majestic doesn't do them justice. Other-worldly? Perfection? I don't know. But I was immediately glued to every word he spoke.

![Drei Zinnen](/images/2021/10/tcl_social_share.jpg)

His thesis is that many thousands of people go there every year, take a selfie, have a drink and head home without hiking around it to see the full impact of how amazing the peaks and surroundings are. The movie then takes a strange turn and decides to recreate the first ascent of Tre Cime/Drei Zinnen in 1869, by Paul Grohmann, with actors/climbers in period-appropriate clothing and climbing gear. It was all very low budget and clunky and terrifying, given their gear. It progresses to show each of the major achievements on the peaks since then, including the still-shocking 2002 free solo of the north face. It's a fantastic informative documentary and you should seek it out.

## Step 1 - Find the right country
Later that evening I told Catherine about it and how ""we should go there sometime"". At this point I still didn't know where ""there"" was.

Catherine's response? ""Let's go. Cancel the anniversary stay in Ardmore and go there instead"". I knew instantly she was right. We've really been embracing the carpe diem thing since last year. We could be dead. Even tho I think I only met [Nigel Pim](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/lives-lost-to-covid-19-nigel-pim-quaker-and-kidney-donor-died-in-january-aged-50-1.4480046) once and interacted with him many years ago on Twitter, his death from Covid hit me more than any other, due to his age, fitness and connections to those I know in Tramore.

I immediately switched into Hell-Yeah Mode. But first, where are they? Italy? Austria? Solvenia? A few seconds googling confirmed that Tre Cime are less than a 3 hour drive north of Venice and they are in Italy right beside the old Austro-Hungarian empire border. 

I quickly figured out that Ryanair Dublin-Treviso and a hotel in Cortina d'Ampezzo was what we needed along with a 4WD rental car just in case (just in case Conor wants to drive a jeep for the first time more like, eh?)

The plan was: Drive to Dublin because Cork Airport is run by geniuses, fly Friday night, stay in a cheap hotel in Treviso, get the car on Saturday morning along with picnic provisions, drive to Tre Cime, do the hike, stay in a good hotel in Cortina d'Ampezzo, do another hike on Sunday, go ""somewhere"" on Monday, fly home late Monday night, back to Cork.

(Update: Ryanair has just announced flights from Cork to Venice (VCE) on Tuesdays and Saturdays from March 29, 2022!)

## Treviso
Overall it worked out incredibly well with only minor glitches like a motorcyclist nearly killing us both on a hairpin mountain bend. It started badly with Passport Control taking over an hour to process one plane. But the [B&B Hotel Treviso](https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Hotel_Review-g187869-d13387547-Reviews-B_B_Hotel_Treviso-Treviso_Province_of_Treviso_Veneto.html) turned out to be great value, basic but clean, friendly and filled with vending machines. Less than 10 mins in a taxi. Also the only hotel where I've ever been asked if I wanted sweet or salt for my breakfast. What a brilliant compact way of putting things.

We used Leasys for the car which worked out fine but I suspect they only have a small number of vehicles compared to the big brands. The vehicle itself was a Jeep Cherokee. How something can be that big on the outside and that small on the inside I will never know. A reverse Tardis. The drive went from motorway to small road, to smaller road, to oh jesus we're going to die. But when we got there, we hit a multi-mile car tailback going up to the start of the hike. I was reminded of the old ""you're not in traffic, you are traffic"" line. 45 minutes and 50 metres later, I did a U-ey. So much for low season and no crowds.

We stopped in Misurina and ate our picnic beside the gorgeous lake. More mind-boggling views. Then twisty-twisty mountain road all the way to Cortina d'Ampezzo.

![Misurina](/images/2021/10/tcl_misurina_lake.jpg)


## I don't think your uncle Harry would approve
As I'm not a skier and 1981 was a very long time ago, I had never heard of Cortina either, unless that's what the car is named after. But it is famous as a ski resort and as the location for some set-pieces in [For Your Eyes Only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Your_Eyes_Only_(film)). For fun we tried to watch it that night. Oh dear, those Roger Moore era James Bond movies have not aged well. Interesting that Cortina looked almost identical back then.

Then another fantastic discovery happened. I wondered if the famous [Lavaredo Ultra Trail LUT](https://www.ultratrail.it/en/) was held anywhere near us, given the name. Hah, it starts and finishes outside the front-door of our hotel! So once checked in, we walked the first tiny bit of the race until it went vertically up. LUT is getting added to my ""not some day, 2022"" list now. 

Almost all of the hotels were shut in the region as we'd managed to pick the week after the end of the summer season. [Hotel Cortina](https://www.hotelcortina.com/) was just about to close but was absolutely lovely and again everyone was so friendly. I have to thank the manager who brought me to their secret car parking area and hilariously berated my driving the whole way there. By the end of it, I was Giuseppe Farina. Fun moments like that stay with you long after.

![Hotel Cortina](/images/2021/10/tcl_hotel_view.jpg)


## Would you like some cheese with your cheese?
Now we get to the only downside of the trip. If you don't survive solely on a diet of meat and cheese, you're going to struggle in Northern Italy. Remember this is a place where 60+% of people speak German and it still has that strong Austro-Hungarian thing going on. So dried meat, cured meat, hunted meat, Irish beef (really!) and cheese are your options. Even tho I turned vegan in 2020, I couldn't help be impressed by the supermarket having an entire section dedicated to mozzarella.

The poor [Happy Cow app](https://www.happycow.net/) could really only recommend one Japanese fusion place in all of Cortina plus some places that had veggie options. But we did some digging and realised many places will do a Marinara pizza which doesn't have cheese. The ones from [Ai Due](https://g.page/aiduefornicortina?share) were superb. And another proper Italian moment - All of their pizzas had two toppings and he literally wouldn't let me add another. So basically ask him for Marinara con verdure to get aubergine and courgette.

The following night we ate in [Il Ponte](https://www.ilpontecortina.it/). This is a standard tourist joint with a massive menu including Hawaiian pizza :-) Rather than ask for vegan options, I realised the simplest thing in Italy is to improvise yourself from the menu. So Mariana pizza con rucola e olive was fabulous (rocket and olives, plus the capers from Catherine's salad). Her salad wasn't great but the simple pasta with tomato sauce was fantastic. And she could have asked them to add various veg etc. You could easily work up a multitude of variations of pasta or pizza that are no extra work for the kitchen since they are making them all to order anyway. A lovely bottle of Pinot Nero to go finished off our night nicely.

![It Ponte](/images/2021/10/marinara_pizza_il_ponte.jpg)

Wait a second, this post has completely gone off the rails hasn't it?

## Tre Cime, OMFG
Right, we got up early on Sunday, filled up on breakfast and drove up to Tre Cime. Catherine had to close her eyes for the last couple of miles of relentless hair-pin bends and minimal armco. Quick tip - there is a toll on the last long section up to main carpark of €30. You can park before there and hike up but it's a couple of hours at least. There were no traffic jams at 9am but the carpark at [Rifugio Auronzo](https://goo.gl/maps/STrGX3E3GPDTHD4c7) was almost full when we got there. Early my ass.

It was gorgeously sunny but freezing up there. If you are doing this, possibly at any time of the year, wear warm clothing including a hat and gloves. My thin TNF gloves weren't warm enough and my running tights were a bit too wind-transparent. Our puffas were ideal tho. 

Initial views over the valleys were incredible and I was surprised to see everything from small kids to OAPs heading off on their hikes. 

![Valley from Start](/images/2021/10/tcl_valley_start.jpg)

We turned the corner and caught our first glimpse of Tre Cime. Holy fuck. And that's how it went for the entire hike in terms of descriptive language.

![View from Start](/images/2021/10/tcl_start_of_hike.jpg)


Oh I forgot to mention that I'd bought two maps - [Kompass Naturpark Drei Zinnen](https://www.mapsworldwide.com/maps-charts-atlases-c1811/walking-hiking-maps-c1814/kompass-karten-gmbh-kompass-map-047-naturpark-drei-zinnen-parco-naturale-tre-cime-di-lavaredo-p21233) and [Tabacco 03 Cortina d'Ampezzo e Dolomiti Ampezane](https://www.mapsworldwide.com/maps-charts-atlases-c1811/cortina-dampezzo-dolomiti-ampezzane-tabacco-map-03-p13147) along with the [Cicerone Shorter Walks in The Dolomites](https://www.cicerone.co.uk/shorter-walks-in-the-dolomites-third) book. The route we were taking around the peaks was Walk 9 from the book. Surprisingly they don't provide GPX files online but I found one that seemed to match their written route and loaded it on to [Outdoors Online]() on my phone and Garmin InReach.

Speaking of which, my [Strava for the hike is here](https://www.strava.com/activities/6091762182) along with downloadable GPX.

The first stretch of the route was fine and got a little steep up to a fabulous spot at Forcella Lavaredo that had views for many miles in all directions. Tre Cime itself just got more and more impressive as you saw it from each new angle. 

![Side View](/images/2021/10/tcl_side_view.jpg)


## Slip sliding away
Then things went pear-shaped badly. The downhill on the other side was in the shade and was covered in rock-hard snow and ice. I have no idea if that's there all year round or if there had been a snowfall recently. But it caused minor chaos. There was a thin relatively clear strip along the edge with a drop off so we weren't doing that (hats off to the young uns who did). My Hoka Speedgoats were gripping brilliantly, but Catherine's Pegasus Trails were useless. But before proper hikers get sniffy about the footwear, everyone struggled except for those who came prepared with micro-spikes. One young guy ended up on his arse in expensive looking Salomon boots. 

![Ice Start](/images/2021/10/tcl_snow_ice_start.jpg)

It took us forever to edge down. The Black Diamond poles once again proved to be worth every penny. Catherine was terrified but we kept going as it was easier than trying to go back up. It wasn't particularly dangerous as the track is quite wide and it would be possible to get slowly down on your very wet arse if you wished. Some people overtook us but the majority stayed stuck at the top for a long time and we left them far behind us. I am sure most who didn't have decent footwear or poles turned around.

![Ice End](/images/2021/10/tcl_snow_ice_end_2.jpg)

It was extremely cold in the shade but we relaxed a bit once the track dried out and we headed up to Rifugio Locatelli. We'd have murdered a coffee at that stage but it was shut. 

![Steep Back 1](/images/2021/10/tcl_north_side_steep_back.jpg)

The route down to the plain was very easy and the track back up was clear but very steep. Even the twenty-somethings were stopping regularly to catch their breaths. Remember, for Paddies, our starting point was at more than twice the elevation of Carrauntoohil.

![Steep Back 2](/images/2021/10/tcl_north_side_steep_back2.jpg)


## Is this even real?
Many many many pictures were being taken and the sense of ""this feels like I'm in a painting"" never left me. 

![North Valley Panorama](/images/2021/10/tcl_panorama_valley.jpg)


The last time I felt like that was above the Grand Canyon in the 90s. When your brain sees something completely new and of that scale, it struggles to make sense of it. Like the first astronauts looking down for the first time maybe.

![North Face](/images/2021/10/tcl_north_face_2.jpg)


Just when we thought the last mile or so would be a doddle, we hit a repeat of the first problem. Which was surprising since it wasn't in the shade. Interestingly, despite the drop-off, we'd both got a lot more comfortable with the edge and used that since it was clear and dry rather than trying to fight the packed snow again.

The only tiny wrinkle before we got back to the start was a spot where the trail had collapsed and what remained was covered in slippy ice. You could easily fall to your death there. Given all the tourists, it really needs to be rebuilt. We tip-toed incredibly carefully across.

![Valley Near End](/images/2021/10/tcl_valley_near_end.jpg)


When I first read about this route, I thought 6 miles would take no time at all and we might need to do a second hike to fill the day. It took us 3.5 hours!! That's a new low-speed record for me.

We were both wrecked after the effort of it all and luckily the canteen-style cafe in Rifugio Auronzo had polenta, roasted mushrooms and roasted aubergine, almost like they were expecting me or something :-)

## Venice Schmenice
The following day we did a few hours in Venice which is still to be avoided at all costs. I don't know how they are going to fix it but do yourself a favour - skip it and do Tre Cime instead. Up there, you won't find insane crowds in narrow passageways, ridiculous fashion shops or awful pizza, just that wonder of the natural world. But if you do insist on Venice, we had a lovely simple vegan meal in [Ogio](https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d7147203-Reviews-Ogio-Venice_Veneto.html). My final vegan tip - the cafes in Treviso airport all have a range of soy-milk coffees as does Hotel Cortina.

## Just do it
This post was not originally going to be very long. It was supposed to just be an ode to Tre Cime but I figured I may as well make it useful if you are thinking of going.

My two main takeaways about our trip were:

[1] How Covid has had some positive impacts. From finding incredible routes in Ireland like [The Sheep's Head Way](https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/) to discovering Tre Cime and now seeking out other ""hidden"" gems. It's ridiculous how little of Europe we have visited. What other epic places should we know about?

[2] How lucky we are to be European and to easily be able to get to such amazing places barely a few hours from our front door and hang out with our European brothers and sisters.

Any questions about the trip or the logistics, just shout.

Treffen 2005 in Bandon,"The Honda Goldwing Owners Club had their annual Treffen in Bandon last weekend. It was a thrill to see so many fabulous bikes from all over Europe around the town. I could make a crack about the fact that the owners all seemed to be overweight middle-aged men, but as I now fall firmly in that category, I shall desist.

They did a parade on Saturday afternoon and we caught them on the return leg as they headed back to the camp in the GAA pitch. I took a few piccies quickly which are below and I also used the ""movie"" feature of the Ixus 400 to grab some video. This is quite possibly the worst quality video ever posted on a blog. Check it out below. 

The boys were hugely impressed by the cool bikes, particularly the trikes and the ones with side-cars. On our drive from Wilton to Bandon on Sunday morning, we had to wind down the window and let Oisín wave at every single bike that we passed.

Events like this are great for a town and hopefully this will encourage more Clubs to come here. Porsche 911 Owners Club - any interest?

I catch a bit of AM Kelly on Today FM on the way in to work. Jesus, does she ever play anything other than bland innofensive soporific music? Fair enough at 4am but something a little more noisy at 6.45 to stop me snoozing off and ploughing into the nearest tractor would help. At least Dempsey gets it and plays the Kickstart right after the news. This morning was ""Bat out of Hell"". Still makes me laugh every time I hear it for some reason. However, if it does get voted the best driving song of all time on Top Gear then there is no hope for the British driving public as they all drive crammed into the middle lane of the motorway.

Twenty years of blogging on conoroneill.com,"I somehow missed the actual [20th Anniversary of the Blog](https://conoroneill.com/2001/04/17/first-post/) back in April and finally noticed last week. This could be a massive post with links to highlights and lowlights over the past twenty years but I think I'd prefer to keep it short.

![Twenty Years A Blogging](/images/2021/09/20_years_a_bloggin.png)

After using Frontpage in the 90s and hosting a ""homepage"" on Indigo, Geocities and others, I made the move to Blogger on April 17th 2001. That was followed by the golden years of blogging from 2006-2010 on WordPress and eventually the move via various static site generators to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a few years back. 

My output ranged from multiple posts per day to sometimes only one post in a year, but I never lost the bug. Even when I wasn't blogging I'd be thinking ""that'd make a great blogpost"". But in recent years it usually became a throwaway Tweet that disappeared into the ether, never to be read again (or even the first time).

And that's why I'll keep plugging away here as people's communications fashions come and go. There is something important in the history of people's activity on the internet having longevity. I've ranted about Yahoo's cultural terrorism in the past and I'm even more concerned that everything that happens on Social and Private Messaging could disappear forever at the whim of a tech-bro.

It's why [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) is so important. And why we need something like it and like [GitHub's Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) for all of those conversations that deserve archival. If an asteroid wipes us out, will future entities think that we stopped communicating with each other in 2007?

Whilst a lot of what I posted here over twenty years was rubbish, there have been some posts that people have found useful or valuable. Year in, year out, Google Analytics tells me the same small set of useful/non-opinion posts get most of the traffic here and on [my tech blog](https://conoroneill.net). I want to write more like that over the next twenty years. 

I might even write another [award winning post](https://conoroneill.com/2007/01/05/you-may-feel-a-small-prick/) when blogging become cool again, around the same time as skinny jeans."
Two blogs well worth a look,"The biggest hole in the Irish Blogging scene is the lack of women bloggers. I have no real idea why so few women blog, particularly when examples like [Dooce ](http://www.dooce.com/)are there to show what is possible. It probably just boils down to the fact that, in general (and by ""in general"" I am in no way trying to invoke a stereotye or in any way label any sub-grouping of humanity. Please don't hurt me), women don't get a kick out of geeky gadgets and buzzwords and only start using technology when it becomes genuinely useful. For example, high temperature ceramics really only moved out of geeky labs and into mainstream usage with the invention of the GHD Straightener. He ducks, he runs.

So I am really happy to report that things are starting to change and I have to recommend two blogs to you.

The first has been around for several months and is called ""[That Friday Feeling](http://thatfridayfeeling.blogspot.com/)"". It consists of the musings of a thirtysomething single woman living somewhere in rural Ireland. She talks about life, men, health, weight and living down the bog. Curly K has a great turn of phrase and is always a good read, not just for girlies.

The second I found out about because the author also has me on her blogroll. Her blog is called ""[The Arse End of Ireland](http://arseendofireland.blogspot.com)"" and only appears to have started very recently. I know it is early days but the signs are so good that I am going to pin my colours to the mast and offer the opinion that we may have finally found the female [Twenty](http://twentymajor.blogspot.com/)! And in this case it doesn't look like a character but seems to be a real person. The Swearing Lady is very very funny with just the right level of exasperation, grumpiness and cynicism.

They are both in my Bloglines subscriptions and deserve to get much much bigger readerships. Check em out and let me know what you think.

Two lovely hot sauces from Mexico,"It's been a while, I know. I spent most of 2013 focused on [my tech blog over here](http://conoroneill.net/). But I thought I'd kick off 2014 with a foodie post.

I use a lot of hot sauce but tend to be very boring in the ones I buy, mainly sticking to the supermarket reliables like Tabasco and Encona. I've got the odd Irish one too but many of them seem obsessed with heat and not flavour (Rebel Chilli being the worst culprit here).

One of my [most spammed blogposts here](http://conoroneill.com/2006/03/31/buffalo-wings-mmm-tasty-but-not-so-hot/) is the one I did on Frank's Hot Sauce back in 2006\. However I've long given up on Franks due to the lack of kick and depth.

I recently [read an article about the Sriracha](http://qz.com/132738/the-highly-unusual-company-behind-siracha-the-worlds-coolest-hot-sauce/) obsession in the US. It lead me to believe that only one company in California was responsible for it and the distinct bottle. But their company name bears no resemblance to the one in my fridge, so I'm not sure how accurate anything they said was. I only use Sriracha in kebabs (I know, culture clash) as I find it a bit a too raw-garlic-smelly. Then I found [this great piece on Pando daily](http://pando.com/2013/12/12/lets-face-it-sriracha-isnt-that-good/), giving Sriracha a good kicking and recommending some alternatives.

The ones he mentioned that stood out for me were by [El Yucateco](http://www.elyucateco.com/) and I found a bunch of places online selling them without too big a gouge to Ireland. So I ordered their Chipotle Hot Sauce and Green Chile Habanero Hot Sauce [off eBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/El-Yucateco-Chipotle-Hot-Sauce-/131057906997?ssPageName=ADME:L:OU:IE:3160).  And boy am I glad I did. The Chipotle is a bit too smokey straight out of the bottle on to your finger, but it does some sort of crazy transformation the second it hits food. Everything tastes better, everything! It must be packed with umami. It's not very hot but adds depth and some heat to spruce up even the most boring of foods. The Habanero is very hot, but not madly so. It is lovely and fresh and adds a lot of zing. A great replacement for Tabasco or Encona everywhere.

Try them out. I'll be ordering more soon as I'm nearly out already.

Two Upcoming weddings,"We're thrilled to hear that both Ciarán O'Colmáin and Ethna Winter are getting married (Ciarán in February and Ethna in January) Not many left to go now from the UCD Eng class of '90.......

Ethna's other great news was the recent birth of her son Felix. I've already cracked particularly weak""Odd Couple"" jokes about her lad meeting our Oscar for the first time."

Ulster Bank finally joins the 21st century,"Only six years after everyone else. 

Their upgraded [Internet Banking service](http://ulsterbankanytimebanking.ie/) now supports Firefox/ Mozilla/ IE7/ dunno_what_else. Previously they only supported Internet Explorer with Microsoft's own Java VM and, wait for it, Netscape 4.7! 

How embarrassing must it have been to work in web development in that company? I sent them stinky mails about once every six months for the past few years including links to the Microsoft site where the continued use of the MS VM was listed as a no-no. It all fell on deaf ears.

The only reason they finally had to upgrade is that Internet Explorer 7 will be released late this year and the site would have been unusable by all their customers. Nothing like a shotgun to the head to motivate the lazy and the gormless.

How many years will I have to wait before they roll out the new site for business accounts too?

Note, it does allow Konqueror to be used but gives a warning that it is not supported - on every shaggin mouse click! Apart from that Konqueror works fine. They may even support Mac users too.

Ummera do Smoked Bacon,"To mix vernaculars; Holy god, [Ummera ](http://www.ummera.com/)Rox! Wifey spotted Ummera Smoked Bacon in [Urru ](http://www.urru.ie/)in Bandon today and bought a pack.

[![Ummera Smoked Bacon](http://static.flickr.com/18/70598611_fda7662e82_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/70598611/ ""Photo Sharing"")

Check out the back fat on that baby. Hell, I even have trouble competing with that.

Ummera Smoked Eel - From Ballymore Eustace to Bandon,"I have promised to blog the Ummera Smoked Eeel since the day I got it and I actually ate it about a week after receiving it in December. Before eating, I scanned all my cook books and the general consesus was that brown-bread, lemon and maybe horseradish were the things to eat it with. But Anthony of Ummera warned me not to over-do it with extra flavours so I took it easy.

[![](http://static.flickr.com/38/80822648_73634d1c3d_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/80822648/ ""Photo Sharing"")

I was actually quite tentative about eating it which is ridiculous considering I'll wolf down wasabi dunked sashimi in the blink of an eye. But I think I had always heard phrases like ""an acquired taste"" over the years and then Ruth in Urru said it was a niche product (but quickly qualified that it was lovely). And blow me, it is bloody lovely! Nothing like what I was expecting. Think very subtle smoked mackerel but with a much smoother and nicer texture. I was going to just have a taste but then said shag it and gobbled the lot of it down. I did put it on dark Ryvita - I'm not sure if this is the food equivalent of eating it with Monster Munch but I thought they worked really well together. I then tried a tiny squirt of lemon juice and it worked brilliantly. But I realised that Anthony was definitely right - horseradish would have overwhelmed it.

So why the hell is this a niche product? It is as tasty as Smoked Salmon and I assume it is all wild. What are the stock levels like? Is it over-fished or is there plenty of room for expansion? I'm really surprised this is not on more restaurant menus. I'd eat it any day in preference to other smoked fish. Surely D4 foodies would love to be the innovators with this on their canapes?

Ballymore Eustace you ask? Is it like the opposite end of the Sargasso Sea? Nothing so exotic. Just another reminder that there is nothing new under the sun. My mother heard about my eel blogging and told me that her grandfather used to cook up fresh eel in the frying pan when she was a child. Quick mental arithmetic puts this around mid-1950's and he lived in Ballymore Eustace in Kildare. She remembers it leaping around the pan! Does this happen due to nerves firing post-mortem or was it just her grandad trying to freak her out? In any case, if my great-grandfather liked eel, then it's good enough for me too.

So lobby your TD, have a march around Stephen's Green, do a fun run and let's get eel up where it belongs on the Irish diet and maybe we can reduce the sales of fish fingers. Or maybe just ask for it in your deli.

Ummera Smoked Rashers: Taste-tastic!,"I've just cooked up the smoked rashers that Catherine got in [Urru](http://www.urru.ie/) during the week. They were gorgeous. I was surprised when I opened the pack to see that it did not contain a few thick rashers but lots of very thinly cut ones. This is exactly the way I like them - I've never been a fan of those thick cut things which often end up a chewy as old boots. They usually have the word ""traditional"" on them. If I see this word on Irish food products, my brain automatically replaces it with the word ""shite"".

But back to the [Ummera](http://www.ummera.com/) rashers. Tons and tons of fat which, as Anthony points out in the earlier post, is where the taste is. They cooked up and  crisped up beautifully. I popped the first one in my gob. The main things I noticed were that they were not very salty (again a plus) and the smoke flavour was nice and subtle. Sometimes on smoked food you get the sense that they welly on the smoke to make up for low quality meat. Actually, I get the feeling that some products have smoke ""flavour"" out of a bottle rather than real smoke. Not the case here. Wonderfully tasty rashers. I rustled up a BLT in double quick time and ate the nicest one I've had in years.

OK, so they are pricey - over €4\. But what would you prefer to spend your money on - a weekly mouthful of mass produced crap which costs you feck all but tastes of nothing or a less regular treat which costs a bit more but which you remember for days?

Tomorrow - Ummera Smoked Eel. Off to Clon now to see if I can find horseradish root and then on to Union Hall again to get my first ever lobster - unless I chicken out on the way.

The next posting will attempt to bring together Smoked Food products and [The Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/). But I don't know if my brain is up to it.

Unemployed in Greenland?,"I was watching The Princess Bride for the gazillionth time the other night and had forgotten how many great one liners it has. So the next few postings are all going to have completely unrelated titles from that movie.

Last year I bought a Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350 video capture card. The main reason was to transfer an ancient (vintage 1980) family video to DVD and also to transfer all our Sony HandyCam Video-8 to DVD. This was my third attempt to do this.

The first (in 2000) was to buy an ATI All-in-Wonder 128-Pro. Software was a flakey as hell and I never managed to capture and save the video with sufficent quality. At that time I was trying (and failing) to create VCDs with my CD Burner. Strike 1.

Last year, on impulse, I bought an Avermedia DVD EZMaker USB2.0 to try the same but targetting my new DVD Burner. It was dirt cheap, with good reason. What a piece of shit. Incapable of capturing video with movement without the whole screen degenerating into jaggies. Also didn't work with most capture software. Strike 2.

Then late last year I got the Hauppauge. Home Run! Captured the whole video in one go, perfect quality (or as perfect as a 24 year old tape can give you) and straight to DVD with no problems. I've been too busy to do all of the camcorder footage and I've kept meaning to hook it up to the TV aerial socket in the home office to check out its TV capabilities.

I finally did this on Sunday. Holy Crap! I now have my own (slightly clunky) Tivo. The software isn't great but it is functional. The scheduler worked on recording Scrubs (""let's hang out"", ""sure, if by hang out you mean 'throttle you'""). The main reason for needing this is that Sky doesn't do ITV (ok, no loss there) or Channel 4\. So I'll never miss another Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall program again.

In keeping with our telly-addict household, we are also getting Sky+ installed today. As Sky is already digital, it records the MPEG stream to Hard Disk without needing any encoding. The funny thing is that my technophobe Dad was the first in the extended family to get one. Golf is a very strong motivator obviously. We all saw it in action over Easter and all of the men decided they _needed_ one, now! Even Oscar my 5 year old is dying to get it (no more missed episodes of Drake and Josh).

And the poor old VCR is now is a cupboard unconnected to anything. First time I haven't had a VCR wired up to a TV in 14 years.

Next job is to get TV listings for Ireland working on the WinTV (maybe using SageTV plus xmltv) and then wiring it up to the TV. Two steps forward, one step back."
"Unfit, cough, moi? Wheeze.  What was the question again?","The war on weight continues and I am debating whether to start a weekly post on the Bloggers Belly Bulkometer. Half a stone in a week is not bad going. Those couple of bottles of wine and cans of Becks each week were obviously contributing _slightly _to the inexorable move towards Rick Waller territory.

Tonight will be a major trial. Curry with brown rice, no naans and no booze in the house on my own. And they dare complain in New Orleans about how tough it is over there.

Next week I might try a bit of exercise, but it is far more fun instead just to read the [Unfit Comic Strip](http://www.comics.com/comics/unfit/index.html) which just gets better and better.

Unique O'Neill,"<div style=""clear: both"" />We specialise in giving our kids names that either can't be pronounced outside of Ireland (Oisín), can't be pronounced inside of Ireland (Sibéal - or Sibín as the Health Board thinks she is called) or make people go ""ah, named after X?""

""Memories of China"" in Bandon now called ""Honk Kong"" for pity's sake. And my favourite of all time, ""Xerxes Ginwalla"" in Kimmage, is now called something so forgettable, I can't remember it.

Universities belong inside cities,"I was a bit sad today to read this from the UCD Alumni office:

> UCD will soon be saying goodbye to Earlsfort Terrace and completing the move to Belfield. Generations of students spent their university years at the Terrace and hold fond memories of that time.
> This year, the last medical and engineering students will make the journey to Belfield and the Terrace will transfer to the National Concert Hall for major redevelopment as a multipurpose concert venue. To commemorate 124 years of UCD at Earlsfort Terrace....

From 1st Year to 3rd Year Engineering (1986-1989), we alternated between the Terrace, Merrion Street and Belfield. Then in 4th Year, they moved us out to the new Engineering building. I still think it is the worst thing UCD have ever done. I know they needed the space but there is simply no comparison between going to college in a City with all the facilities and social aspects that provides and going out to some horrible 60's-style campus in the middle of nowhere.

I loved Merrion Street, I loved Earlsfort Terrace, I loved being part of the City. I hated so much of Belfield, apart from the huge increase in the number of women :-) I actually have fond memories of individual rooms in the old buildings. And who can forget the Merrion Street canteen with the white loo tiles on the walls or the pink pork chops in Earlsfort Terrace? I can't say the same about anywhere in Belfield.

I was in UCC a few weeks back and that warm feeling of ""this is why I liked college"" flowed through me. Compare that to CIT on the edge of the city where everyone has a car and there is no sense of place. It is just somewhere to go to be lectured.

I'm not explaining myself well and I know I'm an old fart, but still."
Urru Bonanza Days,"Just got a mail from Ruth in Urru, Bandon. They have come up with a great idea called bonanza days. It kicks off with all kitchenware half price on Fri 29th/Sat 30th! I'll definitely be popping in for that.

Future bonanzas will include €1 coffee days, Free Urru Cotton Shopping Bags , Massive Savings on Wines, Cookery Books, Farmhouse Cheeses, Easter Eggs, Lucky Dips and more.

Mmmm, latte.

I love seeing Urru making a mockery of the long-held belief that you can't do gourmet in Bandon. Now we just need a few more really good restaurants."

Using smashed phones as extra computers at home during the pandemic,"I've always been interested in maximising the lifetime of electronics. I detest built-in obsolescence and I hate the way computers are becoming impossible to upgrade or repair yourself. Apple is the absolute worst culprit in this area and their actions result in others following their terrible example.

Apple's logic is that phones and computers should be like TVs and no-one ever upgrades or repairs their TV. Except, we used to. I still remember the RTV Rentals man coming to our house to replace the tuner in our TV as the existing one couldn't handle the signal of my new ZX Spectrum. 1970s/1980s TVs were modular so it was only a few minutes work. We need to go back to that.

At my most extreme, I recently upgraded the aforementioned 39-year-old ZX Spectrum to have HDMI-out. It has been loading games from SD cards for several years.

![ZX Spectrum](/images/2021/03/spectrum.jpg)


[""Right to repair moves forward for your broken devices. But campaigners want to go much further""](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/right-to-repair-moves-forward-for-your-broken-devices-but-campaigners-want-to-go-much-further/)

I also love using cheap electronics to do powerful things. This is why I adore the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) ecosystems so much. If you can imagine it, you can probably do it with a few Euro and some combination of those plus cheap modules from Aliexpress. Things I have built recently using this approach (and will blog soon) include a cloud-connected CO2 monitor and a cloud-connected oil tank monitor.

Related to this, one challenge I know many families have had during these pandemic lock-downs is access to computers for all their kids. Obviously the easiest solution for many people is to get a great Chromebook for approx €200 but not everyone can afford that.

How many of those people have smashed phones in a drawer that you suspect are still working? 

![Smashed S8](/images/2021/03/smashed.jpg)


I have a completely smashed four year old Samsung Galaxy S8+. Its own screen mostly stays black but sometimes flickers on and off. I dropped it at the start of the Chicago Marathon in 2018 due to the exhaustion of [Aer Lingus's flight from hell](https://conoroneill.com/2018/10/15/flight-ei123-and-the-death-of-the-aer-lingus-brand/). When I got home, I was informed that [a] Vodafone had never applied the phone insurance policy to the S8+ when I had upgraded to it so [b] It would cost €320 to get a new screen. After telling them politely to get fucked (seems to be a recurring thing with me and Vodafone), I promptly bought a cheap new Huawei Honor Play instead. Great phone. The S8+ sat in a drawer until I decided to try this experiment.

I'm pretty sure the vast majority of non-techie people don't realise that any modern smartphone is a supercomputer in their pocket. And, depending on the model, is more that capable of being a desktop replacement for many common tasks. And I don't just mean schoolwork. You could easily build an entire web application or website with this setup.

And it's doable for as little as €35. Let me show you how.

You have two possible approaches depending on the age and capabilities of your phone. 

## Option 1 - A USB-C phone
The easiest way requires a relatively modern Android phone with a USB-C charging connector. That's the one which works either way around. I have successfully tested this with a two-year old Huawei P30 Pro and that smashed Galaxy S8+.

Literally all you need to do is to go to a site like Amazon UK or a store like Currys/PCWorld and buy a few things:

* A USB Mouse
* A USB Keyboard
* A USB-C Hub with HDMI-out
* A HDMI cable (if you don't have a spare)

The cheapest decent Mouse/Keyboard combo I found on Amazon was this [Asus U2000](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075R9TH9H/). It cost me £10.82!! Both keyboard and mouse are shockingly good. In the past I have also bought some no-name wireless keyboard/mouse sets for < £20 on Amazon and they have been pretty rubbish. But wireless is a little bit handier for a lot of people.

The cheapest good suitable USB-C hub I found on Amazon was this [Ablewe 5 in 1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07YWWZJ65/) for £18.99. Again I was really surprised by the quality.

Note that the price of each item comes in under the new Brexity customs and excise limits. If you have (or know someone who has) Amazon Prime, definitely do it as separate free-delivery orders.

TBH that's the hardest bit done.

![Setup](/images/2021/03/setup.jpg)


Assembly is a matter of plugging your phone's charger into the power-in on the hub. Plug the keyboard and mouse into the USB sockets on the hub. Plug the HDMI cable into the HDMI socket on the hub and plug the other end into your TV. Then turn on the phone and plug the hub into its charging port.


Some phones require you to pick an option in the display settings to use the external monitor but most will just immediately mirror their screen to the TV. Huawei phones have a fantastic desktop mode where everything on the TV is in full-screen and you get a Microsoft Windows type user experience. My Samsung S8+ is a bit crappier where all the apps fill the screen, but the main home screen doesn't. A minor annoyance.

![Huawei Desktop](/images/2021/03/huawei.jpg)


Yes, this does involve using your TV if you don't have a spare monitor. But hey, my entire generation learned how to use computers this way!

Right, so you now have a supercomputer with a keyboard, mouse and screen, what can you do? Wait a second, I want to tell you about option 2.

## Option 2 - A micro-USB phone
If you have an older or cheaper Android phone that has a classic micro-USB charger (the type you always try to plug in the wrong way around), you *might* be in luck.

In this case what you need to do is:

* Check if your TV has Google Chromecast built-in
* If it does, you need to test it with your phone before trying anything else. Install [Google Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app&hl=en_IE&gl=US) on your phone and follow the instructions for mirroring your phone on the TV. If it works then skip to the mouse/keyboard purchase instructions below.
* If you don't have Chromecast on the TV but it does have Screen Mirroring or Miracast, check in the settings of your phone whether it also has Screen Mirroring or Miracast. Follow the phone instructions for setting it up.
* If you have neither on your TV, then you can consider buying a Chromecast device. They are [€39 with free delivery in Ireland](https://store.google.com/ie/product/chromecast). But before you do, install Google Home on your phone to confirm that it is compatible (most phones are). Chromecast also lets you display Netflix, RTE Player, YouTube and Eir Sports on your TV via your phone's internet connection.


Now that you have the display piece sorted, you need to get input working. On these phones, you need the following:

* A USB Keyboard and Mouse (see Option 1 above for the details on that)
* A cheap USB Hub [like this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sabrent-4-Port-Individual-Switches-HB-UMLS/dp/B00BWF5U0M/)
* A cheap USB OTG adapter [like this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TECHGEAR-Adapter-Compatible-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B00G1KQE76/)

In this case, plug the keyboard and mouse into the hub and plug the hub into the phone using the OTG adapter. You should be able to use the keyboard and mouse to control the phone now.

The two big drawbacks of this compared to option 1 are the screen mirroring, which can be slow, and the inability to charge the phone whilst you are using it.

Note I've tested this on a cheap <€80 Nokia 2.2 phone and it worked perfectly.

![Nokia 2.2](/images/2021/03/nokia.jpg)


So back to the question, what can I do with this setup? Lots!!

## Using your phone as a computer
The most obvious things you can do with the phone, now that it's connected to a big screen and has decent input devices, are as follows:

* Zoom / Skype / Google Meet / Webex / GotoMeeting / Microsoft Teams. But better, easier.
* Google Docs / Sheets / Drive on a decent sized screen and with keyboard/mouse navigation
* Chrome web browsing in ""Desktop Mode"" so you don't get stuck with mobile versions of sites
* Full GMail and Google Calendar via browser
* Decent YouTube, obvs
* Firefox web browsing in Desktop Mode if you don't like Chrome
* Faster typing etc on general messaging like SMS, Signal, WhatsApp

So basically anything you normally do but a lot easier.

## Online software development
But wait, there's more. An ever increasing number of software development tools and environments are now available in the browser. The days of having to install horrendous monstrosities like Eclipse are going away. This is just a selection for the curious and there are many more.

* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) - This needs to be much better known. It's a really cool online environment for building and re-mixing WebApps and web-sites in your browser.

![Glitch](/images/2021/03/glitch.jpg)

* [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) - I still don't have access to this (pretty please GitHub) but I'm really looking forward to it. Microsoft Visual Studio Code and lots more in the browser. 

* [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) - This is a brilliant way of using JavaScript on low-power devices like Bluetooth badges and watches. If you want to get into the world of IoT, have a look.

![Espruino](/images/2021/03/espruino.jpg)

* [Arduino Online IDE](https://store.arduino.cc/digital/create) - The classic educational IoT platform is now available online too. Arduino is how most people start with IoT and it has a massive ecosystem of hardware and software. But it can be a bit daunting to get started.

* [Microsoft MakeCode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode?rtc=1) - Wow, I only recently discovered this. An online environment for building games, IoT, Lego, Minecraft etc etc. Totally worth a try.

![Make Code](/images/2021/03/makecode.jpg)

## Termux for local development
You want even more? How about a full-blown Linux environment on your phone where you can run Python. Node.js and a ton of other standard software development tools? You can even build and run a web-server on your phone! And interact fully with GitHub etc.

To do this, you need to install [Termux](https://termux.com/). This taps into the underlying Linux kernel on your phone to provide a protected ""old-school"" command line environment. It's crazy good! 

I've even installed youtube-dl using it and downloaded YouTube videos for offline watching on flights (remember flying?).

But this comes with a big warning. Termux is no longer available on the Play Store for technical reasons. You need to use an alternative additional app store called [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/). If you are not comfortable doing that, stop here and just enjoy all the other features I've listed above. If you are comfortable, install from the link above (after enabling ""allow installation of apps from unknown sources"" on your phone).

![Termux](/images/2021/03/termux1.jpg)

You can then run the Termux terminal and install Linux apps using commands like:

```bash
pkg install python
pkg install nodejs
pkg install youtube-dl
pkg install emacs
pkg install nano
pkg install git
```

I won't dig into any more details on that but suffice to say that the classic node.js `hello world` web server can be implemented and run on your phone. Which is mad.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});

```

![Termux 2](/images/2021/03/termux2.jpg)


Or run the legendary text editor, [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), which I first tried on a multi-thousand-dollar Sun Workstation in the 90s.

![Emacs](/images/2021/03/emacs.jpg)

## But but but what about iPhones?
It seems to be possible but I haven't done it. [This adapter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lightening-Adapter-Digital-Converter-Compatible-White/dp/B0872Y1NH2) looks like what you need. It provides HDMI and USB connectors for £25 and can probably be used with a cheap combination wireless keyboard and mouse. 

There is also a Termux type app for iOS called [a-Shell](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438) which lets you run Unix commands on your phone.

Let me know if you try it and it works for you. 


## In closing
I'm not going to claim this is the ideal solution to anything but it's an option for some people and it's also a fun experiment to see what's possible with devices that maybe spend most of their time on Twitter, Snapchat or TikTok.

If you find it useful, if you have any questions, or if you know of other interesting things like this that are possible with phones, let us know."

Vendors I would recommend,"I've bought a few bits n pieces on eBay and the web recently and all of the vedors were top-notch and I'd recommend them.

First off I got an FM Transmitter for my car which takes a line-out from an iPod or a USB key. It has taken a bit of fiddling to get a frequency that is not used in either Bandon or Ovens but I'm very happy with it and it only cost ?27.94 including P&P. To be found here on eBay:

[USB/MP3/iPod/DvD/Cd Player & Car Stereo FM transmitter](http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItemanditem=5782285324)

Vendor looks like he is in UK but item shipped from USA. Got it in a week.

To go with that I got a very nice Memorex 1GB thumb-drive. A bit of an odd shape but good value at ?42.49 including PandP. To be found here on eBay:

[1GB Memorex USB 2.0 Travel Drive](http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItemanditem=5210125567)

Vendor took a while to ship it (ordered June 23rd, shipped July 6th) but it arrived a few days after shipment. Based in Singapore.

But the prize for the most unexpected excellence in online retailing goes to [Discount Watches](http://discount-watches.co.uk/index.htm) in the UK. I had spent weeks trying to find a good online seller of both [Casio Baby-G GMS](http://discount-watches.co.uk/cat7_1.htm) and [Waveceptor](http://discount-watches.co.uk/cat60_1.htm) watches. Thought I had found the perfect one in Germany but on ordering, it turned out they had no GMS in stock, so I cancelled.

Then I found [discount-watches.co.uk](http://discount-watches.co.uk/). I emailed them to check in advance that they shipped to Ireland and that they had the watches in stock. No reply. Bum. Decided to try that old fashioned means of communication, the phone. No reply. Double bum. Rang the next day and got through to a lovely woman from Llantwit in the Vale of Glamorgan. Nearly said ""I'll have a bacardi and coke please Myfannwy"" but asked about the watches instead.

Not only were both in stock but they only charge a fiver delivery to Ireland. The real clincher tho is their prices - less than half RRP in many cases! I ordered on the phone with the semi-expectation that I was about to be diddled. Three days later the watches arrived and are perfect. I cannot recommend them highly enough."

Walking away from Facebook after 11 years.,"I've been meaning to write about giving up on Twitter since last November. I think I'll now wait until I've been off for 12 months.

I kept threatening to walk on Facebook too. I'd like to thank Facebook for killing the List Feed feature today so they made the decision for me. I'm done.

My first two posts on Facebook were in 2006 and 2007. I was complaining about it even then!

![Facebook First Two Posts](/images/2018/08/facebook_first_two_posts.jpg)

For a short while, I really thought Facebook could be something amazing with all of their developer initiatives. But the relentless direction changes which killed many startups soured me completely. For most of the rest of the time, I've only been there for the people who weren't anywhere else. Old friends and family members. But in the past year I've noticed a massive drop off in their presence on Facebook too. So now I'm largely shouting at myself. A bit like this blog :-)

There's not much more to say. You didn't need Facebook before. You certainly don't need it now. Install Signal on your phone, setup some groups and do a lot more interpersonal messaging. Also personal emails never stopped being awesome.

## My last post on Facebook this morning is as follows

The only way I've been able to stomach Facebook for the past many years is with List Feeds. No algorithmic bullshit, just a chronological list of posts by the people/pages I put in the ""Everyone"" List. If someone/thing got too gobby, I just removed them from the list. Simple, with me in complete control.

Facebook is removing that feature today. And with it ends my regular use of Facebook.

2,230,000,000 - 1.

It joins Twitter as something I'll only use when there is no other way of finding out something about an event, or attending it. Or one of you dies. So basically a mix of Eventbrite and rip.ie.

I deleted the apps off my phone many months ago and had only been using the webapps.

I'm still noodling around on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cwjoneill/) (webapp only too) but I'll be mostly going retro and re-focusing on my blogs at [conoroneill.net](https://conoroneill.net) and [conoroneill.com](https://conoroneill.com). I'm just about to go live with my email-to-blog tool for Hugo to make that as easy as possible.

I also tinker a bit with [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@conoro) (not bad, but full of exactly who you'd expect to be there) and [Fritter](dat://fritter.conoroneill.com/) (an experiment not remotely ready for primetime and needs the Beaker browser).

And of course [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/cwjoneill) for the runners/cyclists.

Best way to message me directly is using my mobile number on [Signal](https://signal.org/).

In any case, my small set of followees also anecdotally confirms what FB's recent stats showed - A lot of you have already left or have stopped posting. I'm sure I'll pop back in here every once in a while to watch the increasing tumbleweed and listen to the growing crickets. But in the meantime:

Watch your first Ultramarathon online with the Kerry Way Ultra,"## The Kerry Way
Whilst millions of people have completed marathons over the past few decades, ultramarathons are still pretty niche. Ireland has a bunch of fantastic ultrarunners and a handful of amazing ultramarathons. 

The big kahuna of them all is the [Kerry Way Ultra](http://www.kerrywayultra.com/), which is about to have its tenth outing on September 2nd and 3rd. The Kerry Way is a wonderful trail that traverses the entire Iveragh peninsula. Many people travel from the US and mainland Europe to do multi-day hikes of the route.

![Ridge above Waterville](/images/2022/08/kwu_ridge_waterville.jpg)


## KWU Races
Whilst an Ultra is anything over 26.2 miles, it generally starts at 50k and there are some standard distances of 50k, 50 miles, 100k, 100 miles and a few at 200 miles. KWU is a bit different and has 4 races this weekend:

* Lite - ~58k from Sneem to Killarney
* Nite - ~100k from Dromid near Waterville to Killarney.
* Relay - ~200k loop of the entire Kerry Way in teams, start/finish in Killarney
* Full - ~200k loop of the entire Kerry Way as individuals, start/finish in Killarney

![Full Route](/images/2022/08/kwu_route.jpg)

## Eileen
The Race Director, Eileen Daly, is rightly a legend in the Irish ultrarunning community. A former co-worker of mine described her as a force of nature. She has created these very special races that have none of the pomp and hype of other more famous races around the world, but have 100x the heart and the humour.

## 2021 Lite
I did the Lite last year and [it was amazing](https://conoroneill.com/2021/10/03/the-kerry-way-ultra-lite-2021-beyond-words/). It will stay with me forever as a formative experience and was the first time I felt like a proper ultrarunner even though I had run longer distances, if that makes any sense. On top of that, strangely, as I passed the walking dead who were doing the Full, I wasn't dissuaded, they made me want to try it. 

I really can't believe how I have gone from first hearing about KWU maybe 6 years ago and thinking it was for superhuman lunatics, to finding myself getting ready to take it on in less than 24 hours. Yes I'm completely freaked out but luckily I watched [Touching The Void](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtnqVZEktyg) this week, so a wee amble in Kerry over the weekend isn't looking so terrifying any more.

## The Golden Hour
The best ultrarunning podcast out there is [The Adventure Jogger](https://theadventurejogger.com/). Host Ryan Ploeckelman proves time and again that lots of humour mixed with knowledge and insight is the perfect combo for a podcast. 

His [interview with Harvey Lewis](https://soundcloud.com/user-172228713/harvey-lewis-getting-better-with-age) had me laughing out loud like a loon as I tripped relentlessly above Foilmore on one of my KWU recces this summer. 

In another episode, a guest pointed out that in an ultra, spectators only care about the first few people over the line, and the last few people over the line. This was proven in spades last year when Eoghan O'Neill and Denis Bowen crossed the finish line of KWU with 40 seconds to spare. 40! The clip of them finishing was a running highlight of 2021 for me.

## The Full route
You can check out the [Live Tracker](https://live.primaltracking.com/kerrywayultra22/) with the route but you can get an even better sense of it from the 2021 route [on Trace de Trail](https://tracedetrail.fr/en/trace/trace/157243). Particularly the elevation and distance travelled at any point.

## Watching it Live
This year they are trying something new and will have a bunch of live broadcasts online throughout the 40 hours. It'd be fantastic if lots of people who have never looked at a race or an ultra in their lives tuned in for some of it. I think you'll enjoy it!

All the links you need are on [this site](https://live.kerrywayultra.com/) but the main ones are:

* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kerrywayultra/) - Watch out for Stories and Reels
* [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TheKerryWayUltra)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLB6h9qRTza5XFyfNEPb72w)

The outline schedule for broadcasts is as follows:

* Friday 2nd, 5.45am - Ultra Countdown & Kickoff from Killarney Race Course 
* 10am - Glencar 
* 1pm - Glenbeigh 
* 5pm - Waterville 
* 7pm - Caherdaniel 
* 9pm - Waterville, Start of Ultra Nite
* Midnight - Waterville, Burning the midnight oil with some past runners 
* Saturday 3rd, 8am - Sneem, Start of the Ultra Lite 
* 12am - Kenmare 
* 4pm - Killarney Finish Line. Special guest Charles speaking about recovery for athletes
* 7pm - Killarney Finish Line. Special guests speaking about the importance of running for mental health.
* 9pm - Closing ceremony. Special guests who are experts in nutrition for extreme sports

And if you want to follow a very slowly moving dot on a map, my bib number is #147 and the [Live Tracker is here](https://live.primaltracking.com/kerrywayultra22/). Let's see how I do. Particularly when the rain comes in at night."
Waterfall Farm Shop - Why aren't there more places like this? ,"We were over in Ovens recently looking at patio ""toppings"" in Irish Aggregates. On the way back I finally decided to check out Waterfall Farm Shop. I've known about it for more than two years and passed it a few times but just never took the extra few minutes to have a look.

The farm also appears to have a food distribution business as they had several branded vans parked in the yard. A few tired old labradors gave the perfect welcome. The shop itself is basically the corner of one of their barns where they store veg for the other side of the business. So it was coats all round.

At this time of year I didn't expect much apart from root vegetables but they had a good selection of fruit n veg. I'm guessing the banana's are not grown on the farm. The lady running the place was really friendly and pointed me to a few of her favourites. I grabbed one of those apple juices made near Cahir and some jams that are made on the farm. Then I spotted her relishes. A sweet beetroot pickle looked lovely as did the ratatouille-style chutney.

I picked up a few more bits n bobs like eggs and went back over to her at the register. It turns out that it is her farm and she makes all of the jams and relishes herself. As she was totting up, I grabbed a few beetroot and she gave them to me for nothing!

I then realised I didn't have any cash and told her I just had to pop out to the car to get money off my wife. Her response? ""Shur you can catch me the next time"". Wow. I really thought that world no longer existed in Ireland. A world where trust is the default position and you assume good of people. I was deeply impressed but I also insisted on getting her the money.

I can't recommend her jams and relishes highly enough. They are all stunningly tasty.

If you live or work anywhere around Ballincollig, Waterfall or Ballinhassig, you should be giving these fine people your business. I'm really looking forward to heading back for the early summer produce.

It is surprising that there are not more places like this in West and Mid-West Cork. Apart from the fantastic farmers stall at Halfway where you can get corn cobs and a ton of other fresh veg for three quarters of the year and the odd place advertising ""farm fresh eggs"" near Clon, I'm not aware of anywhere else near me. If you know of any, please let me know as I am happy to do a detour (or shortcut as I call them) to give them my business.

We declare our resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation,"I woke up this morning [to read about](http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1017028.shtml) Brian Cowen's ""Innovation"" Taskforce and have spent since then utterly enraged.

In a time of crisis when men/women of vision and ability need to quickly agree a strategy and execute it with confidence, Brian Cowen assembles 28 people (plus the heads of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and representatives from the departments of Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Finance).

Yes my jaw hit the floor too.

A 40+ person talk-shop and travel expenses generator. That's what Cowen and Coughlan think this country needs?

Because it's worked so well in the past? Does the word agile mean anything to these people?

40+ people and two of them are women?

What century is this?

When Sean Lemass and T.K. Whitaker dragged this country kicking and screaming out of a hellhole from 1959 onwards, did they spend months (or years) prattling on with anyone who had on opinion?

I actually have a pain in my stomach with anger over this. These are our leaders? I'm not talking about CandC, I mean the committee. Did anyone who was asked say ""NO, get a clue""? Did anyone who was asked question the utter stupidity of assembling this joke? Did anyone who was asked, reply ""ENOUGH TALKING"".

Is there any senior person in the Irish Civil Service or Quango-sector who is tearing their hair out this morning and screaming in frustration too?

Yes? Then maybe it's time for an alternative.

We need (possibly anonymously):

*   1 Senior Civil Servant, non-EI
*   1 Senior Civil Servant, EI
*   1 head of an FDI company with a large Irish operation in non-manufacture
*   1 head of a globally successful indigenous company
*   1 head of a startup
*   1 politician with a business or financial background

2 months. 3 max.

Outcome - a disruptive plan to rebuild the Irish economy and the business environment in a sustainable way around the idea of Constructive Capitalism. And a marketing plan to go with it. If our leaders won't lead then it's time to subvert from the bottom-up.

This type of thinking:

I was disappointed tho that the old Integral Design web-site was never archived.

Weight Crash in Aisle Five,"Not that anyone cares other than those who have to look at me, but I managed to drop a stone (14 fluid ounces in US measurements and 3 kilopascals in metric) in the past 4 weeks. Only 28 more pounds to go. Targeting another stone by Christmas but that is probably unrealistic. With the money I have saved from not drinking, I'm buying myself a new Ford Mustang.

"We're up to 1986, Speccy Fans","Nick Humphries has done it again.The [1986 edition of ""The Your Sinclair Rock n Roll Years TV Show""](http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tvprog/downloads.htm) was released for download recently. All nostalgic ZX Spectrum fans should grab it and watch 8 minutes of great memories. Non-Speccy fans can listen to the music and Apprentice fans can laugh at how young Alan Sugar looks in it.

1986 was simultaneously the peak of my Spectrum involvement and also my last year. It's all been downhill technically since then. Will I ever need to re-flex my Forth muscles and will I ever finish my Irish-themed Jet Set Willy clone which if memory serves, had ""humorous"" references to Big Ed Loves Mona? I got to over 20K of Z80 assembler, all on paper and never a line tested. Agile schmagile.

West Cork Tweetup,"If you had never heard of [Twitter](http://twitter.com/conoro) before, the relentless coverage of it on RTE and elsewhere recently must surely have changed that. It's a simple system for messaging people who follow you but in a completely public way. You can pick whose messages you see by default too. Here's a quick snapshot of those I follow:
![twitter_snap](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/twitter_snap.jpg ""twitter_snap"")

One of the nice aspects of Twitter is that it leads to real-world interactions too. There are regular meet-ups called Tweetups where people can have a few drinks, maybe a bite to eat and have a bit of proper social interaction.

Ann Donnelly is organising West Cork's first ever Tweetup in Clonakilty this Friday. It's on in the Courtyard Bar in Clon from 8pm.

Wexford: Farm Shops and Citroën SM's,"We spent the halloween weekend down in Rosslare. I know it is now a mini-Dublin but it's a perfect spot for all of the extended family to meet up. There is one shop I want to mention simply because they deserve to be much better known. ""Kate's Farm Shop"" is just off the Duncannon Roundabout towards Duncannon. I found it accidentally during the summer when I went for a ""lets get the kids to sleep for a hour"" drive.

It had been very quiet that time and I spent a good 45 minutes filling a basket full of things that I didn't need. The shop is evenly split between a great selection of fruit n veg at the front and deli-style provisions at the back. They have tons of pastas, spices, breads, cheese, meats, grains and other speciality foods. They seem to do a lot of organic stuff and special-diet products like gluten-free ones.

Of course, it was a totally different experience on the halloween weekend. I actually had difficulty parking. When I got inside, it was jammed. And every single accent in there, apart from the girls behind the counter was south-side Dublin. It was kinda spooky. I immediately felt myself wanting to put on a strong fake Cork accent so I wouldn't be labelled along with the rest of them. But when your basket contains olives, pumpernickle, organic pasta sauce, hummus and japanese pears, you aren't going to avoid labelling ye langer.

Anyway, fab shop. Pay it a visit if you are in the area.

And because I am too lazy to make a separate post, can I just mention that I saw, for the second time in my life, a Citroën SM (not XM!) heading towards the ferry. 

![Citroën SM](http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:Ft-iRq4geSIJ:gallery.mudpuddle.co.nz/albums/citroen-sm/wip_citroen_sm_textures.sized.png)

I had noticed in general the number of 05 cars in Wexford, many of which were WX reg. I even spotted a Porsche Cayenne. But they all paled by comparison to the SM. This was a low volume car developed by Citroën whilst they were in control of Maserati. It is drop dead gorgeous and many of the innovations in it were carried over to the CX. There is [a great article on the history of the car here.](http://www.semantics.uk.com/history/)

What Bandon has to offer,"[Very nice piece by Trevor](http://www.bandon.ie/2011/03/promoting-our-fine-town-what-we-have-to-offer/) on what the town has to offer. Why not leave a comment over there with your thoughts?

&nbsp;"
What if I suggest a structured recipe format and you critique it?,"Between this blog and my [posting on eGullet](http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showtopic=84811) regarding the sort of structure people would like to see on recipes in blogs, I received the sum total of zero/null/nada/nialas replies. The world was about as vocal as that time I asked ""so do I look good in these speedos?""

In retrospect I should have suggested an initial idea and then asked you all to improve on it. So read on and start entering comments. Critical is good, bitchy is good, offensive is good. Silence is badddddd.

Here are my initial thoughts for ""fields"" that might be useful in a structured recipe on a blog. My starting point is the RecipeML spec plus fields from Gourmet Recipe Manager and anything else that popped into my head.

From The RecipeML Spec (renamed for clarity):
Title
Measurement System (U.S., Imperial etc)
Creator (Person)
Source (Book Title etc)
Date (Of Creation or Publication)
Rights (Copyright or other)
Summary Description (one liner)
Preparation Time (overall time)
Yield Quantity and Unit (4 pancakes or 5 servings)
Meal Category (Starter etc)
Main Ingredients Category (Pasta etc)
Cuisine Category (Italian etc)
Ingredients (each one a separate ""item"" rather than block text with count/amount/range/unit broken out too)
Description/Instructions (as free form block text)

Other possibilities:

Picture(s) (either on the blog/site or externally hosted)
Rating (how much you like it yourself!)
Difficulty Level/Experience Required
Notes (e.g. warnings)
Dietary Information (e.g. gluten-free)

Ones from the RecipeML spec which may be overkill:

Equipment
Variations
Recipe broken into parts (pastry vs filling etc)
Subtitle
Version
Breakdown of Preptime into phases
Nutritional Information

What next? Burberry buys the Corsa division of Opel?,"I don't know whether this is good or bad news, and either way it has no impact on my life, but [Lous Vuitton is buying Aston Martin](http://www.autoblog.com/2007/02/01/scoop-louis-vuitton-buys-aston-martin/). Sure they are both luxury brands but mixing handbags and camshafts - I'm just not sure. It smacks of one of those ""synergy"" horrors which used to be so common.  Maybe Daniel Craig will sport a man-purse in the next Bond movie.

Hopefully they'll do something about the rear-end of all recent Astons which to my eye are identical to a mid-1990's Mazda.

"What next Sir Alan, the Amstrad C5?","AMS is really dropping the ball recently, isn't he? How many years did it take him to finally decide to stop flogging a near-dead horse and put a bullet in the em@iler? Was no-one in the company strong enough to tell him it was the best product to come out of a British company since The Royal Carriage and Wagon company decided to  compete against the Ford Model T with their new Shetland model, now with automatic pooh collection.

But then what does he do? He fires Karen in ""The Apprentice"". Here we have a woman with a first class mind, a great team player, who can think on her feet and grab opportunities as they happen and what does the Guru do? He fires her instead of the nutcase or the insipid management consultant who regularly uses the phrase ""brain-storm"" and isn't trying to be ironic.

I'd hire Karen in a second. Who wouldn't want a lawyer who was bright, dynamic and easy on the eye? Our current lawyer is both bright and dynamic but I don't think Kieran will ever look good with a neck scarf and some lippie.

It looks like Sugar is going for another journey(wo)man who won't rock the boat or challenge him in any way.

That wrinkle-removing electrocuter they were trying to flog in the documentary on the guy who won last year was great entertainment. Who in their right mind would buy a Slendertone for your face? It is clearly targetted at the crazed insomnia crowd who get excited watching SellaVision and their special deals on ""Genuine Faux Pearls"".

The team in Brentwood are still locked in the 1970's Amstrad mind-set of ""well it may be naff, but we'll give you six for a fiver"". We all loved their twin-tape recorders and even their genius twin-deck VCR. The home computers flattened Sinclair, their wordprocessors were perfectly timed and the first generation PCs weren't that bad either.

But since 1992? Naffink!

I'm just waiting with bated breath for the AmsPOD. Bucking all current trends, this beauty will come in one colour; brown. It will play all the major sound formats: MP1, BBD, KindaRealAudio. It will come with a swish leatherette case (including free cubic zirconium inserts) and will be available from all major outlets on Tottenham Court Road.

But as long as they hold on to Syed and Jo for their pure entertainment value, I'll keep watching and bitching.

Whatchoo Readin' For?,"(In the immortal words of Bill Hicks).
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Just got an email to tell me that the [West Cork Literary Festival](http://www.westcorkliteraryfestival.ie/) will run from July 5th to 11th.
![](http://westcorkliteraryfestival.ie/themes/portaltheme/images/middle-image.jpg ""West Cork Literary Festival"")

Now I'm not the most literary person in the world. My last three books were ""Presenting to Win"", ""Bad Science"" and something by Harlan Coben. Next up is ""On the Origin of Species"". But even I've heard of some of the heavy-hitters who'll be attending the festival. Annie Proulx, Roger McGough, Francesca Simon and Louis de Bernières are just four of the writers appearing at this year’s event which features some of the best writers, poets and illustrators from Ireland and abroad.

The Official Festival Launch is in Bantry, leading to a top few days of readings, seminars, workshops, children’s events, exhibitions, music and good old-fashioned hospitality.

Booking for the Festival is on 027 55987\. All info on [the web-site](http://www.westcorkliteraryfestival.ie)."

Where does Ireland go from here?,"Like most people in the country I'm pretty depressed about where Ireland has ended up. And I don't see an election, which replaces one set of [Peter Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle) County Councillors with another set, helping in any way. Politics in Ireland is completely broken and I'm finding myself in a situation where I don't want to vote if all it does is elect more of the same.

In an ideal world i.e. not Ireland, you would see new parties forming that build on the anger of the populace and offer something radical, new, modern, urban and focused on National issues. Unfortunately in Ireland, if you want to skip the usual suspects,  you can choose between:

*   a bunch of right-wing religious nut-jobs or
*   a bunch of old-school pinkos in suits or
*   a bunch of  murderers in suits
Even if you did form a new party, it would get almost no votes since it would need to spend years playing the bullshit local politics game that lies at the heart of all of our problems.

Here's how you currently get elected to run the country:

1.  Be a teacher, other public sector employee, accountant, solicitor, publican or auctioneer
2.  Join the local branch of your favourite party
3.  Get involved in ""local issues"".
4.  Build up a support base.
5.  Be seen as a ""family man/woman"" and be heavily involved in sport
6.  Run for the local council and get elected. In Bandon you only need 100 votes to do this.
7.  Bide your time
8.  Become an expert in street lights, water pressure, roadworks, church gate collections, removals and funerals
9.  Run for the county council. Get elected.
10.  Pick the man/woman who you are going to piggy back on e.g. Mini Martin or Batt in Cork. This is critical, pick the wrong one and there goes any chance of you making it to the big leagues when they are promoted/retire.
11.  Bide your time
12.  Finally when the opening appears through death/retirement/MEP-ship, ""throw your hat in the ring""
13.  Get picked by the party to run (you have been networking during all these years to make sure you are the one who is picked, haven't you? )
14.  Hurrah, you now have a seat in the Dáil. You can chill for a few years so you don't rock the boat.
15.  Make sure your local constituency office is very active in the community. If you forget this bit, you'll be out in the next election.
16.  Claim credit for everything the County Council, Public Sector or Government does in your constituency or county. Anything from a new light on the bypass to the actual bypass itself
17.  Make sure the locals see you regularly in your constituency office and make sure they see that you are solely responsible for sorting out whatever it is that they were already entitled to if they had just contacted the relevant department themselves.
18.  Run the next time and get elected
Or

1.  Be a son/daughter/nephew/niece of a TD
2.  Wait until Mammy/Daddy/Uncle/Auntie retires/dies and take their seat.
This is why our Dáil is full to the rafters of people you wouldn't hire to work in your own business in a million years. But they are not to blame, you are. As long as you expect the people who are supposed to be running the country to sort out your mickey-mouse local problems, you are going to elect completely the wrong people to the Dáil. The idea that you contact your National Representative when you have a local problem is so utterly ridiculous it's staggering.

How do we solve this? Well people are too lazy to change so they'll probably have to be forced to (plastic bags anyone?). What if it was made illegal for a sitting TD to contact any government department or public sector body about a constituent's problems? Based on the potential for corruption? Would that sort it out?

Until we fix this local nonsense out and start electing National politicians with the skills and aptitude to run a country, Ireland will remain a tin-pot banana republic with delusions of grandeur run by a cabal of small town operators.

But let's pretend the Irish voters get a clue and start realising they are the problem and they start thinking about the future of their country rather than their townland. Imagine a party with no ties to the past starting with a blank sheet of paper. What would I like to see in their manifesto in order for me to be able to vote for them. Here's a random unordered, incomplete list of the stuff that's been bouncing around in my head.

1.  As I said above, make it illegal for a sitting TD to contact any government department or public sector body about a constituent's problems
2.  Force all public sector employees to resign from their positions if they are elected TDs. Yes teachers I'm talking about you.
3.  Complete and utter re-structuring of the HSE from the ground up. Removal of layer upon layer of health board legacy management.
4.  Firing, demoting or ""early retirement"" for every senior civil servant in Dept of Finance (and elsewhere) involved in the destruction of the Irish economy. It shouldn't just be the temporary government that gets the bullet, it's time the permanent government took some responsibility for their actions.
5.  The titles and responsibilities of all senior Civil Servants to be regularly distributed to the public and those Civil Servants interviewed regularly by the media about their roles, recommendations and decisions.
6.  Cancelling of all state and semi-state contracts with the audit firms that were involved with Irish banks over the past 5 years. Those firms blocked from new contracts for another 5 years.
7.  All public sector pay and promotions based on strict performance metrics.
8.  A 4-week review of every quango in Ireland with the aim to shut down 60% of them in 6 months. Any quango whose only job is to formulate policy, replicate what another quango does or spend training grants to be the first to go.
9.  A rapid-fire review of what FÁS does and whether it provides any lasting value to the people being trained or to the country
10.  A 4-page summary of every contract to the big consulting firms to be delivered by the relevant departments. These would list the intent, projected deadline, projected cost, current actual timeline and current actual cost. Aim to shut down 60% of them in 6 months with no new contracts to the big firms.
11.  Creation of position of Government CIO/CTO (possibly the only decent idea Brian Cowen ever had. Where is that person Brian?) Every public sector IT project over a certain value to be vetted and monitored by small team of full-time IT experts working for that person, not the big consulting firms.
12.  Upskilling of people at every level in the public sector so that IT initiatives become driven by needs from the bottom-up
13.  Mandating of online communications tools wherever possible to reduce public sector travel, both for cost and environmental reasons. This includes things like IM, Yammer, Wikis, desktop sharing, webcam-based video conferencing  etc etc
14.  A guarantee to deliver, before the following election, a list system to bring real expertise into the Dáil.
15.  Either shut down the Seanad or make it directly electable. We can no longer afford a dumping ground for has-beens or never-weres who like the sound of their own voices.
16.  TDs, Ministers and Taoiseach's salaries to be brought down to acceptable levels.
17.  Banning of all Government appointments to state and semi-state boards.
18.  Splitting of RTE into three independent businesses:

    1.  Commercial business spun off as a private entity funded only by advertising.
    2.  Semi-State Public Service Broadcaster funded by a much reduced licence fee. The IMF bailout coverage fiasco was a new low point for RTE public service broadcasting. This needs to be fixed.
    3.  State body managing the network and providing it on commercial basis to all comers, including the previous two (see next point)

19.  Creation of a National Infrastructure Management Agency (NIMA). I was a fan of the privatization of Eircom back in the day but as I sit here on rubbish ADSL in Bandon with no fibre to the town I have come to the conclusion that there are certain things a country should own and control itself. All that talk about sovereignty recently and yet we don't own our telecommunications infrastructure. Who, other than the state,  could build a Fibre to the Home infrastructure in Ireland given the investment required and the long period over which it would make a return?  NIMA would own and manage:

    1.  ESB Networks
    2.  Eircom's infrastructure (this would obviously have to be bought back. What sort of cost?)
    3.  All of the MANs. Any future MAN based on need, not political influence.
    4.  Any strategically important fibre
    5.  RTE TV/Radio Network. An Ad-free, foreign-programme-free www.rte.ie probably fits here with the RTEPlayer

20.  Twitter has made the leap to being a Public Service Utility and should become a mandatory reporting system for all County Councils around the country. It was invaluable for weather and road reporting over the past few weeks. See [Irish Weather Online](http://twitter.com/#!/iweatheronline) and my [TERROR post here](http://conoroneill.net/time-for-terror)
21.  Some other very technical things I want to see (via the Ireland CIO/CTO) from a post I did a year ago include:

    1.  Mashups and data mining across departments/areas to be promoted
    2.  No new public sector IT projects to be approved without an API even if that is just RSS
    3.  APIs to be freely available for use by the public wherever possible. Only exception is where individual’s privacy may be impacted. Where this is an issue, anonymised aggregated data provided.
    4.  A CIO Solutions Catalogue to be created with examples of successful projects from all areas of the public sector that can be re-used
    5.  Strong ongoing data-mining of e-tenders system to find repetition and redundancy and to guide those putting up RFTs to re-use or customise existing solutions
    6.  An agile approach to all projects. Quick prototypes mandatory
    7.  An avoidance of boil-the-ocean projects and a move towards simple quick wins locally which bubble up nationally
    8.  Metrics for success defined at early stage of all projects and reported on at regular intervals
    9.  Off the shelf Open Source to be preferred for all projects
    10.  Once per quarter IRLCamp where public sector and private sector get together and present interesting projects, ideas and technologies and learn from each other. These lightweight BarCamp style events will have people at every level, not formal Powerpoint from senior people.

22.  OPW to be made self-funding with a profit-making mandate.
23.  Is Failte Ireland self-funding? It should be.
24.  Ditto Coillte.
25.  Coillte, OPW, Tourism Ireland, Failte Ireland mandated to generate additional €100m p.a. in revenue from castles, buildings, forests, parks, beaches, camp-sites etc etc in conjunction with new tourist/leisure facilities in all of those. Fees only for the facilities.
26.  Coillte, OPW, Tourism Ireland, Failte Ireland and other tourism quangos mandated to work with private sector to generate new tourism/leisure revenue streams of at least €100m p.a.
27.  Temporary removal of all fees and travel taxes for those travelling to Ireland by air/sea.
As I said, an unordered collection. But most of it very achievable by a new competent skills-based government in 6 months."

Why can't we make TV like this?,"Whilst I'm on the topic of media - how the hell has [Jon Stewart](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml) been on the air for ten years in the US, over a year on More4 in the UK and I only discover him four weeks ago because of some awesome Stephen Colbert clips on YouTube?

This is quite simply the best funny current affairs show on the TV globally. It makes ""Bremner, Bird and Fortune"" look like the repetitive snooze-fest that it became just after the era of TW3\. As for ""The Panel"", well to be fair, that is guest-based so the writing could never compare. But if you look at The Jon Stewart Show, this is cheap TV. Even RTE could afford to make something like this. It is nearly all studio based with lots of spoof location-based reports with blue-screens. It succeeds because of great writers. 

I have never understood how a nation like ours which is supposedly bursting at the seams with literary geniuses has rarely been able to create well-written current affairs comedy. Maybe it's not considered real writing by the numberati. Or maybe the breakthrough will come when a bunch of students with a digicam and a sense of humour start uploading self-written comedy onto YouTube?

Stewart rips everyone to shreds equally which is what makes it so watchable. All of the special correspondents are fantastic and I saw an old clip the other night with both Colbert and Steve Carell which was hysterically funny. Head over to YouTube and search for [Jon Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jon+stewart&search=Search) or [Stephen Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stephen+colbert&search=Search) and you'll see what I mean. Any chance More4 will start showing [The Colbert Report](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml) now?

Some say that YouTube will be crushed by the big media companies due to the amount of copyrighted material on their site. I disagree - clips of Stewart and Colbert and others are just advertising gold. Every viewer of one of those clips is another potential viewer of the show. TV companies in particular would be nuts to go after YouTube, they'd be shooting themselves in the foot.

My discovery of this show probably means it'll be canned next week.

Why Dave Barry is God,"From a 1992 Column in the Miami Herald Tribune:
----------------------
Speaking of true quotations, please repeat the statement that Sonda Ward of Nashville, Tenn., swears she heard made by a man expressing concern to a woman who had been unable to get a ride to a church function.

He said: ''Estelle, if I'd a knowed you'd a want to went, I'd a seed you'd a got to get to go.''

Why we need more events like Ginger Runner Virtual Run #GRVR16,"If you've ever Googled for video reviews of running shoes, you've almost definitely landed on a review by [The Ginger Runner](https://youtube.com/thegingerrunner), Ethan Newberry. For a long time, that was all I knew him for and I bought several pairs after confirming that he liked them. Then I discovered [Ginger Runner Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t33Zi7Pe-jk), where he does long interviews with ultra runners live on YouTube. These are my goto podcasts whilst running slowly, along with [Bad Boys Running](http://www.badboyrunningpodcast.com/), [The Ultra Runner Podcast](http://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/category/podcasts/) and [Adam Buxton](https://soundcloud.com/adam-buxton) (who may not be a runner :-) ).

A few months back Ethan announced The Ginger Runner Virtual Run. On Nov 19th, all entrants had to run for exactly two hours anywhere in the world and upload their GPS trace to Strava. There was lots of swag and a variety of prizes. I just loved the idea of a virtual community all doing the same thing on the same day.

![long strand from top of hill](https://d1tidq54inel9p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/long_strand_from_top_of_hill.jpg)

So yesterday I headed out with the car thermometer at 0C and drove to the back of Long Strand. I then spent 2 hours running around Castlefreke Woods, Rathbarry, over to Owenahincha and on to Long Strand itself. It start badly with me wading through 6 inches of water on a flooded trail but I soon warmed up. The rain that followed was not welcome but I didn't mind it at all. And you know what? It was bloody great! I moved at an even slower than my usual sloth pace and took videos and [pictures](https://goo.gl/photos/KjVB9ZhdCyh3pFef8) and talked to a donkey and said hello to lots of walkers and some other runners.

By the end I was tired and wet and smiling from ear to ear.

Since then I have been looking through all of the [pictures, videos, tweets](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23GRVR16%20OR%20%23GRVR&src=typd) and [Facebook comments](https://www.facebook.com/thegingerrunner/?fref=ts) from others who took part. Like many running events, it has every type of runner, from blobs like me to ledgebags like [Jamil Coury](https://twitter.com/MountainOutpost).

{{< youtube 1smkYBZFkWo >}}

&nbsp;

Of course this is a commercial endeavour for Ethan, but he deserves every penny he makes from it. He puts enormous effort into his running films and all of the [Ginger Runner media](http://gingerrunner.com/) and it's only fair that those of us who benefit from his work/art should give something back, not just via ad eyeballs and affiliate links.

I hope the success of this encourages people in other fields to do something similar. As I said on Twitter, community is about shared interests, not just physical proximity. For all the brutal flaws of social media, particularly recently, Ethan has shown how it can bring groups of us closer together, even if just for a few damp hours.

PS: I was massively impressed with how quickly the Altra Lone Peak 3.0 drained after I waded through that water. After 5 minutes I'd forgotten I'd been soaking. There was no squelching and my socks were just a bit damp at the end of the run.

PS 2: The [Elephone Explorer Pro](http://conoroneill.com/2016/10/02/timoleague-courtmacsherry-elephone-explorer-pro/) needs a power bank permanently connected to it if you want it to even be powered up for two hours, let alone recording. As you can see, it's pretty poor quality video but probably good enough for me for the moment. I'm mightily tempted by that new Garmin Virb tho."
Wine Tasting in Bubble Brothers,"Like blogs? Like wine? Then Julian over at Bubble Brothers is having a wee tasting this coming Thursday. All details [over on the blog](http://bubblebrothers.com/blog/?p=576).
> This coming Thursday, 25th September, Emilio Saez van Eerd of Casa de las Vides and Javier Navarro from Tintoralba (earlier tasting summarized in this post) will be making a flying visit to us, and I’d like to give them and their wines as much publicity as possible.  Check out the EWBC stuff on Vinus TV.
> 
> The day’s events have not yet been decided - but I think it would be great if as many blog and twit and wine folk as possible could come along to a leetle tasting here at the Marina on Thursday 25th.  I’ve already had encouraging responses from a number of people, both on the wine side and in techno-trousers."
"Without Fibre, Bandon will suffer Timoleague's fate ","> Timoleague was formerly a place of some note, being much resorted to by the Spaniards, who imported large quantities of wine here and it is said there were formerly no less than fourteen taverns that sold sack in the town.
> Looking at the wide slob lands when the tide is out, or the shallow waters at full tide, it is hard to believe that here was once a busy Medieval port where foreign merchants from France and Spain bartered their wines and Mediterranean produce for Irish butter, hides and farm produce
In Timoleague's case, the harbour silted up through no fault of the town. In contrast, we can actually save Bandon from becoming  ""formerly a place of some note"".

Due to some catastrophic incompetence a few years back by the powers that be, when the two optical fibres were laid on the way to Clonakilty, no-one thought to spend a few quid running a spur to Bandon. So whilst Dunmanway has a MAN (for what?) and Clon has a fibre-enabled Technology Park, Bandon has residential-quality DSL, at best, for local businesses. In Old Chapel, we max out at 6Mbs down and sometimes 512kbs up.

Anyone setting up a business in the next few years will insist on decent internet connectivity. No FDI company will ever setup in Bandon without Fibre.

The Council is now about to spend millions ripping up the streets of Bandon to install a new drainage system. Why the hell isn't Fibre being laid along all the new drains? It may not be able to connect to anything now, but in a few years time when budget is available again to run a spur here, Bandon could be the most advanced connected town in Ireland.

But of course, being Ireland, we won't, and Bandon will slowly become Timoleague. A lovely place to visit and look at old ruins."

World's Worst Gardener,"A few months ago I stuck some tomato plants that my sister gave me in the veg patch. I then ignored them entirely. This evening Catherine pointed out that I had a few tomatoes.

![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_pMHVPNhiR90/TJz3TmmlHYI/AAAAAAAAAYE/kXHIhohWfjc/s400/IMG_20100924_192049.jpg ""Bandon Tomatoes"")

I really am a disgrace. I can count on one finger the number of gardening days this year. And every Autumn I swear it'll be different next year."
Worst growing season EVAH!,"My ""stick it in the ground and it'll grow"" school of gardening thought has failed miserably this year. The only things that have grown are non-essential herbs, apples, strawberries, sorrel and radishes. And I don't even particularly like the latter two. Actually, I nearly forgot the one rhubarb plant which provided seven metric tonnes of sticks. Lots of yummy tarts for me (as the bishop....).

So I got thick the other day and ripped up almost everything. All the bleedin mint and oregano, all the sorrel, the stupid radishes, the weeds, the 3 rocket plants (from two packets!). I've laid them flat on the bed to rot down but it made me think, surely that is a net zero as far as nutrients are concerned?

So gardening gurus, top tips please. I think I should dump a ton of home made compost in, maybe chicken manure or bonemeal, cover the lot over with newspaper and try again next March. Thoughts?"
Yahoo Mail Beta -finally! Initial impressions,"Months after I signed up, I finally got access to the new Yahoo Mail Beta programme. I've been using Yahoo mail as my ""we are a web-site, give us an email address"" address for over ten years now. In that time, I don't think it has really improved one iota in usability apart from the addition of spam catching. It has always been slow, clunky and riddled with obnoxious massive ads.

The new one is a major improvement on the usability front. Full ajaxian interface with drag n drop and reasonably speedy 3-pane display. So far I like it a hell of a lot but there is no way it is ousting GMail as my favourite email system. There are far too many ""please wait"" messages for my liking. And the screen real estate just does not seem to be used efficiently.

But the number one problem is the continued presence of those horrible huge flashy animated ads. Let me make this clear Mr Yahoo: In ten years of using Yahoo mail, I have never, ever, clicked on one of those ads. If I suffered from epilepsy, I am pretty sure they would trigger an attack, they are so visually  offensive. In a much shorter period of time, I have clicked on many Google Adsense ads. The are unobtrusive, relevant and don't take up half the screen. If you want to beat Google, do some simple end-user surveys and see if anyone on the planet likes your current ads.

But if Yahoo mail is your primary web-mail system, you are going to love the new one.

Yahoo Mail Beta Screenshots,"As requested by Jerry, here are some screenshots. What makes the ads even worse is that they are animated so it is impossible to concentrate on reading the e-mail content because they are so distracting.

[Microdrives](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7744297797233161593)

You have no idea, none, how much I wanted a microdrive as a teenage geek. I would have happily chopped off my little finger yakuza-style to get one. And this guy, the luckiest man alive, has 8 of them!

And what is it about rose tinted spectacles that I would be happier now to be given a ZX Spectrum +2 with a Kempston joystick than a fully loaded Dell XPS?

I automatically deride anything that Nicholas Negroponte is involved in as snake-oil (Media Lab Dublin, I laughed when they announced it, I laughed when they closed it). But the [$100 laptop](http://laptop.org/) has the potential to create a whole new generation of programmers from places you would never have dreamed, just like the Spectrum, BBC Micro and C-64 did for us as kids. Let's hope he doesn't screw it up.

I think maybe we've all forgotten the impact those machines, and ""The Computer Programme"" on the BBC had on a multitude of British and Irish kids. I shudder to think what I would be working at now if my parents hadn't had the foresight to get me a Spectrum when I badgered them incessantly for it. And I know I've blogged this before, but [it is still the funniest thing on the whole damned internet](http://www2.b3ta.com/heyhey16k/).

Yes the fish is fantastic,"I did a last-minute race down to The Fish Shop in Union Hall this morning to check it out. It's as good as they say! Great selection of fish, shellfish, gourmet seafood products and wine. Well worth travelling to.

So my lazy ass didn't get up early enough and I left Bandon at 12 knowing they shut at 1pm on a Saturday. I made it to Union Hall by 12:45 after spending the journey as far as Rosscarbery behind someone who averaged 35 MPH. The three younger squirts came with me and were just as impressed by the foggy views in Glandore as I was. The whole area is just lovely.

The shop was hopping when I arrived and lots of empty trays told me I'd left it too late. The guy serving confirmed that it had been a really busy morning. Given the horrible weather I decided to do a fish pie and I bought hake, smoked haddock, prawns (frozen since they were sold-out of fresh) and mussels. Add 6 scallops for tomorrows dinner and the total came to a very reasonable €38.

You just know you are getting ultra fresh produce in a fishing village and there is something for everyone. I particularly liked the look of the John Dory, Sea Bream and Sea Bass. They have a lots of live crab, lobster and oysters too. The display cabinet had some very interesting products like smoked tuna and they also have lots of the ususal frozen shellfish. I didn't get a chance to check out the wine but I will on the next visit.

Yoplait and Summer,We've got a big batch of Yoplait Orange and Melon yoghurts (the family favourite) in the fridge with dark fruit flecks in them (blackberry maybe?). Not a big problem but it also happened last year. Now I've just realised [it was almost exactly a year ago](http://conoroneill.com/2006/07/29/yoplait-make-oscar-mad-again/)! Very odd.

Osc was blown away, he could not believe that he got all this stuff for, as he put it, ""some words on a bit of paper"". He wanted to keep everything in his room so his siblings would get none of it but we pointed out that he needed a fridge for that.

In the interest of disclosure, I should point out that my Da worked in Avonmore-Avongate/ Avonmore/ Avonmore-Waterford/ Glanbia from 1974 until he retired and he did forward the original blog post to someone in there. But I have a sneaking suspicion it was the letter that did the trick. Consumer Food companies have to be very sensitive to any issues regarding food labelling and my guess is that they jumped on this as soon as they found out about it. In any case, Osc doesn't know that his Grandad worked there so he thinks they are the greatest company ever. Only 40 more probiotic drinks to get through......

Yoplait makes Oscar mad again,"Osc opened a Melon and Orange yoghurt yesterday to discover it actually contained Fruit of the Forest. So did two others that he checked. In one of his favourite books ""Stink and the Incredible Supergalactic Jawbreaker"", the hero (Stink) writes a letter of complaint about a jawbreaker that did not break his jaw. The result is that he gets sent a huge box full of sweets. I think maybe Oscar is hoping something similar happens here. 

His letter is as follows:

Don't worry, you don't have to be remotely geeky to do the reviews. Both of my parents are very non-technical and they do SMS reviews all the time. You don't even have to sign up on the site, it'll happen automatically when you send your first review to 087-9409325\. Here's all you have to do:

![LouderVoice SMS Instructions](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/sms_instrs.jpg)

There is a good [selection of reviews from Taste of Dublin](http://www.loudervoice.com/tags/Taste+of+dublin) here so you can see the sort of things people were saying. If you want to do it in Cork just follow the instructions above and your reviews will appear on LouderVoice a few seconds later. If you know for definite that you'll be trying it ahead of time, why not leave a comment here or ask any questions you might have?

The SMS are at your standard rate, they are not premium rate. You can also write long SMS reviews if your phone supports them. We'd love to see the feedback you all have on both the event and the exhibitors, many of whom are local Cork businesses.

By the way, if you run a local biz that is exhibiting at Taste of Cork, we'd love to provide you with mini-flyers to give out to encourage people to review your offerings. Either pop a comment here or mail me on conor AT loudervoice DOT com for more info."

You may feel a small prick,"I've recently been getting lots of contraceptive advice from men my age. It seems the only logical route is vasectomy. One of my best advisors had his done quite a while back with no adverse effects.  There is only one guy in Cork who does it, Dr Pillay on Patrick St and he highly recommended him.  He also (quietly) mentioned that performance would not be affected and I wouldn't be shooting blanks for the first thirty. Important tip!

My old workmate C told me all about his on a trip to Dell in Limerick the day after it had been done and he seemed fine. Mr B in Paris last week concurred that it was not such a big deal. I also saw the documentary last year where that brave man from Galway bared his knackers for all to see as his tubes were cut. The valium made him collapse in fits of giggles and I wondered if this was standard practice.

Add to this the gentle encouragement of Catherine's sister Claire ""I'll come after you with garden shears if you even think about another baby"" and we decided that enough was enough. I visited Dr Pillay at the start of December to talk it through and once he heard the number ""5"", he didn't probe for motivation any further. It all sounded pretty straightforward: snip snap, bish bash bosh, few days of discomfort and off ye go and climb Everest.

Catherine checked multiple times that I was ok with the idea and that I wasn't rushing in. I guess I must be deeply shallow because in my mind it was at the same level as a root canal or deviated septum op. No concerns about emasculation or man breasts (I have those already), no ""what if my entire family is killed in a fire and I want to have more kids when I'm 70?"" type questions. Just simple basic ""my wife cannot take the pill until menopause"" and ""Five is enough. Enough. Seriously tho, enough."" Maybe I'll wake up one day and scream ""oh dear jesus my testicles are no longer connected to my vas deferns"" but I doubt it.

The only prep that had to be done was hair and the major question to be answered - blade or cream? Blade - are you mental or something? Veet it was. Hmm, that's an interesting look for me, sort of a comb-over effect. Why does no-one ever mention that Veet burns? Ahh, small print, avoid genital area. Ow ow ow.

I headed in on Friday 14th and unfortunately forgot about the goddammed Christmas shoppers and arrived 15 minutes late, totally stressed and sweatin. To quote my buddy Eoin, the following bits may be TMI for you. So stop reading now if you are of a delicate nature.

I'd had the heating on full blast all the way in to avoid the Atlantic Swim Effect but the stress of being late negated all of that. Dr Pillay was lovely and asked me if I wanted to relax for a few minutes. I didn't. For some idiotic reason I thought I might be able to read during the op and brought ""The Wisdom of Crowds"" with me. He found this amusing.

So up onto the couch in the corner of his office, keks off, iodine on and we were in business. He warned the local would hurt but it was fine. The incision began and all was well. Throughout the entire thing he had Cork's 96FM on with that horrendous gobshite who does the chat in the mornings. He had on some blokes who have been doing panto since the 50's and it kept me nicely distracted the whole time as the only thought going through my head was ""This is where Radio Jay on Gift Grub gets his material from"".

Some warnings of pressure from the doc, then, jesus fucking christ man are you trying to kill me, arggggh. ""Oh did that hurt?"". Did it hurt? Did it hurt? Would you like me to stick a rusty nail in your nuts so you can get some sense of it? He added more local. Still no joy, so he added some more. At this point I was going to ask for an epidural but the last jab seemed to sort it out. I guess this is where the word numbnuts comes from.

Finally, the big stitches went in, I relaxed and he said ""now we'll do the right one"". Noooooooooooo, it can't have taken that long to cut a tube and fold the two halves back. It turns out that ""things kept tensing up"" making his life very difficult. G'way, a man has his scrotum cut open and shockingly, it doesn't relax into a giant fluffy balloon. Now I know why the guy on the tv was given the valium.

Liathróid a dó was complete, he sowed me up and I felt pretty ok. Lots of advice about not being too energetic. Like that'll happen - I pulled a muscle putting a child to bed the other night. He gave me some Betadine ointment, put everything in a hammock and gave me an ice-pack for the journey home.

Drive home was ok but the ache started around Innishannon. Do you have to drive at 30mph today you stupid stupid person, movvvvvveee, I've just been operated on. Home. Frozen peas into ziplock and I relaxed on the couch. Pain got worse. Panadol my hole, I popped one of Catherine's Ponstan Forte and soon the pain faded to a dull throb.

Over the next few days I was in a very bad state. As the Ponstan wore off each time, it started hurting like hell and the hammock seemed to add to it. I went hammock free for a day but it was far far worse and I put it back. Getting out of bed each morning was not fun. Wound seemed to take it's time healing and in fact here we are three weeks later and there is still a scab. Finally one week after the op, the pain subsided and apart from the long journey over Christmas, there was no serious discomfort. I can confidently hold my own in a childbirth pain conversation now, he said, running for the door.

So now that I have put men off it for life, do I regret it? Not for a second. A week's discomfort for a lifetime of one less major thing to worry about - I'd do it in a second again. And it looks like my best advisor was right ;-)

Just make sure you can get your hands on Ponstan!

UPDATE 1: 1st May 2007 - Just got the all-clear. Woo hoo! This is probably a good thing as we both recently started our usual ""ah Síofra is such a wee darling, one more wouldn't really be that much extra hassle"".

"You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles","Nostalgia time, 80's fans. Due to unprecedented public demand (currently at zero requests), I am making available my classic ZX Spectrum games at no cost. Each of these 4K masterpieces, which took months of pubescent angst to complete, requires either an actual ZX Spectrum or an emulator to play. My two favourite emulators are [EmuZWin](http://bonanzas.rinet.ru/apps/EmuZWin_Eng.htm) and [ZXSpin](http://www.zxspin.co.uk/). The current version of ZXSpin seems to have some problem finding ROMs so maybe stick with EmuZWin for the moment.

The three games are:

[The Grid](http://www.argolon.com/GRID.TAP).   [Screengrab here](http://www.argolon.com/the_grid.jpg). This is a TAP file (the preferred format) which is loaded as a tape.
[Cent The Pete](http://www.argolon.com/centis.z80).   [Screengrab here](http://www.argolon.com/centis.jpg). This is a Z80 file which is just a memory snapshot.
[The Cherry Run](http://www.argolon.com/cherrys.z80).   [Screengrab here](http://www.argolon.com/cherry_run.jpg). Ditto.

Download and be amazed what one teenage geek can create in hand-crafted Z80 assembler with no proper development tools on an original rubber keyed ZX Spectrum 48K. Or maybe just think - what a pile of crap."
You see this? THIS... is my BOOM STICK!,"[Great article and interview on Salon](http://www.salon.com/books/int/2005/07/14/campbell/index.html?source=RSS) about Bruce Campbell and his new book, [""Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way""](http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0312312601). You just can't help liking the man. Does his own thing and is obviously enjoying every minute. B-List my bum.

Still haven't got my hands on [Bubba Ho-Tep](http://www.bubbahotep.com/).

YouGetItBack - What a great idea,"I know they have been around for a bit but I just found out recently about [yougetitback.com](http://yougetitback.com/). It's one of those ideas that just makes you go ""perfect!"". And it is so simple. Sign up with them and pay €9.99 for two stickers which you can attach to valuables like mobile phones. The sticker has a telephone number, code and message about a reward to the finder if it is lost. The chances of it being returned in the case of loss are now far far higher. Bloody brilliant. The €9.99 will give you cover for the items for three years. Bargain.

You'll be getting Internet Explorer 7 pushed to your PC from now on,"If you have Windows XP and if it hasn't happened already then Microsoft appear to be pushing out the new release of the Internet Explorer Web Browser. They are making it optional so you have to agree to install before they do (the security centre logo in the bottom right hand corner of the screen that looks like a shield will be yellow with an exclamation mark in it).

For almost all web users who don't use Firefox as their browser, IE7 is a big improvement over IE6\. The most obvious visible difference is that you can now use tabs to browse. This just means that you can have many sites open within one browser window rather than in multiple windows. Middle click using the mouse wheel on a link should open up a new tab with that link.

One unfathomable change is that the menu bar at the top is turned off by default. If that freaks you, as it did me, just right click at the very top of the IE window and there should be an option to turn it on.

There are two utterly broken sites that I use with which you cannot use IE7\. The first is Enterprise Ireland whose site is just badly designed and non standards compliant and the second is Ulster Bank Online Business Banking. I've ranted enough about how embarrassing the Ulster site is. They have upgraded home users to something designed in the 21st century, we're still waiting for them to do that on the business side.

Most people should install it and will be happy with it. The more people who do, the more designers of badly written web-sites will be forced to learn a few standards.

Your Next Handheld Computer?,"Fantastic mix of features in the [PsiXpda](http://www.psixpda.com/content/psixpda-pocket-computer). For those who loved Psions, this will suit you. For those who work in the corporate world, your IT department will love it, as it runs XP!

Your Sinclair Rock n Roll Years 1987 is out!,"As with all the previous episodes, this one is a zinger even if you were a C64 or (god forbid) Dragon user. I had stopped my involvement with home computers by 1987, what with being in college and discovering drink instead. So I found it particularly interesting that they mention a game called ""[Head Over Heels](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002259)"" which was considered by many to be the greatest example of its genre ever created. 

I'd never heard of it so I've just grabbed it from [World of Spectrum](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/) to play on [ZX Spin](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/emulators.html) and they weren't joking. They did this with 48K of RAM. I think my watch has more than that. Never a huge fan of the 3-D isometric games but this is bloody good.

ZX Spectrum launched 25 years ago today!,"This mightn't be a big deal to most people but it's a huge deal to me. If my parents hadn't got me a ZX Spectrum in 1982, I wouldn't have had the life I've had. No exaggeration. Every single college and career choice I've made stems from the skills I learned on that machine, which I still have (the machine, not the skills :-) ).

Sure 50% of the time I was playing Jet Set Willy and Sabre Wulf but on the Speccy I learned BASIC, Forth and Z80 assembler. I also learned the basic architecture of computers and basic electronics circuits.

I still crank up emulators on my PCs, phone and Palm and still get annoyed over the bugs in the games I wrote!

Thanks to my parents for realising how important computer skills might be to me and to Sir Clive Sinclair for having the clarity of vision to create the ZX series of computers. I'm actually surprised he didn't come up with the [OLPC](http://www.laptop.org/) as it is right in line with his thinking.

Happy Anniversary Speccy!

p.s and just in time, the [1988 Edition](http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tvprog/downloads.htm) of the [Your Sinclair Rock n Roll Years](http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/) has just been released!

UPDATE 1: Colin Woodcock has also just released a Special 25th Anniversary Edition of [the wonderful ZXF online magazine](http://zxf.magazine.googlepages.com/).
