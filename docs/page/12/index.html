        <p>It&rsquo;s been said by many others too but Twitter is seriously denting my blogging. Why write an entire post when most of the time 140 chars will do?
But what will be remembered and found in years to come? Watching Chris Moyles on &ldquo;Who Do You Think You Are?&rdquo; really drove home the importance of historical records.

In a time of crisis when men/women of vision and ability need to quickly agree a strategy and execute it with confidence, Brian Cowen assembles 28 people (plus the heads of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and representatives from the departments of Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Finance). <a class="read-more" href="/2009/06/29/we-declare-our-resolve-to-pursue-the-happiness-and-prosperity-of-the-whole-nation/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Deeply important piece by Ivan on food security and our future. Don&rsquo;t just read it, leave your thoughts too.
The ability of a country to feed itself and have a sustainable agri-business must surely have been a major motivator of Reddy Brennan and his team in Avonmore in the early 1970s. A man of great vision with incredible negotiation skills, he is one of the heroes of Irish industry. Our family will always be grateful to him. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/06/16/ivan-asks-can-we-feed-ourselves/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I can&rsquo;t bear to read the report. It sickens me to think what those evil scum covered up over the years.
I&rsquo;m not a religious person but I take some comfort in imagining everyone involved in the systematic abuse of children in the 20th century burning in the eternal fires of hell.
Some comfort in imagining every priest, every brother, every nun, every bishop, every arch-bishop, every cardinal, every papal nuncio, every pope who knew anything about what was happening in this country and DID NOTHING, being raped by satan every day for eternity. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/23/systematic-evil/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Those of us who are watching much less broadcast TV and more time-shifted or downloaded programmes are starting to become very uncomfortable with the monthly Sky tax just to get some intermittent BBC2/Ch4 etc.
Media companies everywhere try to stop piracy and block those outside of their borders from watching programming online on sites like Hulu. This is a battle they cannot win.
The problem they have at the moment is licensing. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/23/how-pirate-bay-could-be-the-next-news-corp/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My old college buddy Eoghan Whelan has more metal in him due to sports injuries than the average Terminator. As a result, he knows more about pain and injury than most. For the past while he has run a Pain Relief and Injury Rehabilitation Clinic in Dundalk and he now has the beginnings of a blog to go with it.

You can expect to see a lot of information about the treatments in which he specialises (particularly Frequency Specific Microcurrent) appearing on the site in the coming weeks. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/01/relief-for-what-ails-you/">&raquo;</a></p>
