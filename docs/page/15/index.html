        <p>The second year of the Engage Arts festival is fast approaching and it looks fantastic. Something for everyone, no matter what their interests or age.

I&rsquo;ve put together a simple mini-blog for the event over here on Posterous. The aim is that people can upload information, pictures, videos etc very easily over the weekend.It has the full line-up for the two days and contact details too.
It&rsquo;d be fantastic if you&rsquo;d take part in this exercise. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/09/21/engage-arts-festival-this-weekend/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Catherine FitzMaurice from Kilbrogan House just contacted me about an awesome night that is happening as part of the Engage Arts festival over the weekend of Sep 25th.
They are showing the 1925 version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with, and this is the genius bit, live organ accompaniment by Dr Eric Sweeney who is head of Music at Waterford School of Technology. Not only that, but they are showing it in a church. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/09/12/best-movie-idea-ever-and-in-bandon/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Margaret Jordan pointed out on Friday in Facebook that the 1911 Census data is now online. Ever since, a bunch of us have been searching and learning. I&rsquo;ve been looking up O&rsquo;Neill, ONeill, Neill, Flynn, Meaney, Foley, Doran, Wall and Walls to see which of my ancestors I could identify and send them on to my Mum and Dad.
I was thrilled to find this record of my Granny Mary, her parents and siblings. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/08/30/1911-census-full-of-gems/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The stats around Facebook in Ireland are staggering, they are racing towards 1 millions active users here. That just blows my mind. Some are predicting they&rsquo;ll have more pageviews globally than Google by next year!
Whilst I initially didn&rsquo;t have much time for it, coming from the open blogging world, bit by bit its value for me has grown. Even at the simplest level, it is the only site where many people I know from school and college ever congregate online. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/08/28/facebook-and-you/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s been said by many others too but Twitter is seriously denting my blogging. Why write an entire post when most of the time 140 chars will do?
But what will be remembered and found in years to come? Watching Chris Moyles on &ldquo;Who Do You Think You Are?&rdquo; really drove home the importance of historical records.

        <p>Deeply important piece by Ivan on food security and our future. Don&rsquo;t just read it, leave your thoughts too.
The ability of a country to feed itself and have a sustainable agri-business must surely have been a major motivator of Reddy Brennan and his team in Avonmore in the early 1970s. A man of great vision with incredible negotiation skills, he is one of the heroes of Irish industry. Our family will always be grateful to him. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/06/16/ivan-asks-can-we-feed-ourselves/">&raquo;</a></p>
