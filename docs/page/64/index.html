        <p>My first employer was S3, who are 90% owned by Philips in The Netherlands. As a result,I spent quite a bit of time in Eindhoven, where the HQ is based. Big hello to the Eindhoven posse (Mark)!
The Inquirer has an short article on the death of the son of the founder of Philips at the age of 100. They mention what he was in charge of in his heyday. The same name was on a giant sign which you passed in the train on the way into the city from Amsterdam. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/07/one-of-the-best-ever-words-in-a-foreign-language/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was gutted to read in CAR that LJK Setright passed away recently. I started reading CAR when I was 14 years old and continue to do so despite his absence for the past few years.
As a kid, I checked out most of the motoring magazines and CAR was the only one I read where I felt I was learning something, rather than just reading pseudo-ads. For a short while in the late 80&rsquo;s I tried Performance Car but to be honest that was only because of Clarkson. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/07/ljk-passes-away/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>An old old friend (bet ya like that description Jane) is living over in Frankfurt. Her hubby has just finished McCarthy&rsquo;s Bar and is dying to visit the place mentioned in the book which he describes as an ex-church or nunnery in a small town near Cork, on the coast, known for it&rsquo;s good cuisine.
I have no idea where he is talking about and Googling only brings up the actual McCarthy&rsquo;s Bar in Castletownbere. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/05/an-ex-church-or-nunnery-in-a-small-town-near-cork-from-mccarthys-bar/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have a wee bee in my bonnet about how difficult it is to get good fresh fish in the &ldquo;greater Bandon area&rdquo;. When we moved down here, I thought I would have fish coming out of my ears (as opposed to sleeping with the fishes). But it was the complete opposite.
The SuperValu in the town has a small fish counter but you can never rely on it to have anything you want. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/04/hey-dad-thats-the-same-ugly-fish-as-last-week/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Skype and Bluetooth are a match made in heaven. My home set-up is an Acer Laptop with a very nice teeny Neon Bluetooth USB Adapter which I got from Shop4Memory in Celbridge. I also got the latest GG Telecom GG03a Bluetooth headset from them. This is Bluetooth 1.2 compatible, but more importantly can be paired to up to three devices. So with a quick button press, I can switch it from working with the Nokia mobile to pairing with the laptop to pairing with the work desktop. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/01/skyping-with-bluetooth/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We just had Oisín&rsquo;s 4th birthday party. He had a whale of a time in KidzKlub in Bandon and two of his buddies from his old playschool turned up so he was over the moon. He did well on the present front and has just spent the past hour opening them and enthusing in the way that only he can do. Catherine was putting the cards up on the mantlepiece when she noticed something odd about one of them. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/27/i-despair-its-youre-birthday/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Having a look at the Flock browser to see if it is much cop. So far not bowled away at all. This is a test post from its blogging feature. The whole integration thing just isn&rsquo;t as slick as I was expecting.
More importantly, I have setup the &ldquo;Subscribe-to-Comments&rdquo; plug-in. So now if you add a comment, you can get notified by e-mail if someone else replies. It saves you having to constantly re-check. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/24/first-flock-fiddling/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Not that anyone cares other than those who have to look at me, but I managed to drop a stone (14 fluid ounces in US measurements and 3 kilopascals in metric) in the past 4 weeks. Only 28 more pounds to go. Targeting another stone by Christmas but that is probably unrealistic. With the money I have saved from not drinking, I&rsquo;m buying myself a new Ford Mustang.
Another apt &ldquo;Unfit&rdquo; comic to celebrate. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/22/weight-crash-in-aisle-five/">&raquo;</a></p>
