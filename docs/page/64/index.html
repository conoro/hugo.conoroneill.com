So we only got a massive SUV instead of a planet-sized one on our arrival in Texas. We&rsquo;re here for the week and I hope I keep my wits about me and take plenty of Nokia Crap-cam pictures.

        <p>We didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;formal&rdquo; family holiday in 2005 - a week in Rosslare

weariness grew. So we threw caution to the wind, threw the children to
their granny and headed down from Cavan to Capital City for some
pampering and unashamed luxury.

        <p>Ach, I hate giving bad reviews of places. I genuinely want every place I eat in to dazzle me. A few months back a new place opened in Bandon - &ldquo;Jack O&rsquo;Dwyer&rsquo;s Diner&rdquo;. It caught my eye instantly because I had only just been blogging about the dearth of fab and interesting burger joints in Ireland. Of course I was concerned that it would just be another crappy chipper with a bit of an image makeover but deep down I was really hoping that someone had had the vision to make a great diner in Bandon that would put the likes of the Eddie Rockets of the world in the shade. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/01/03/diner-wont-be-dining-at-the-diner-again/">&raquo;</a></p>
