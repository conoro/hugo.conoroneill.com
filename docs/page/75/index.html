        <p>I've seen plenty of mentions of the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/) but I only just tried it for the first time today. Bloody ell! Put in [www.conoroneill.com](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://conoroneill.com) and it gives old snapshots of my web-site going back to 2001\. You can never leave your mistakes behind. I was disappointed tho that the old Integral Design web-site was never archived. It would have been fun to look back at that awful spinning gold 3-D integration symbol I put on our very first web-page in '96\. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/22/web-archive-spooky/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I've been trying out del.icio.us for a week now and I **still** don't get what the big deal is. Yeah it's handy to have the online bookmarks. The RSS feed is kinda irrelevant for oneself but I suppose if someone was stalking me, they might be interested in what sites I am interested in and what tags I put on them. I take back what I said about tags in my previous Bloglines post below - they are actually handy for finding stuff by category (like GMail). <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/22/delicious/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Sam&rsquo;s earlier homage to Yakult as read out on the Gerry Ryan radio show a few months back. I cannot believe this did not win a prize.

        <p>No more Princess Bride quotes I'm afraid. Sam entered a world-class poem into a Gerry Ryan Pot Noodle competition today. Unfortunately she was not selected to go on air (unlike her last piece of genius which was up there with T.S. Eliot and she got to read out to the listening public). So, in order to give it the publicity it deserves, here it is in it's entirety. **The Pot heads** We are from the planet Noodle, We cannot write, we scribble and doodle. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/21/pot-noodle/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We don't have it too bad for restaurants down here in Cork. We've had great meals in Gleesons in Clonakilty, Casino House in Kilbrittain and Broly's in Bandon. Unfortunately most of the places in Bandon target the lower end of the Market and it's nice to see Broly's trying something better. It is a coffee shop/cafe during the day and they re-jig for more upmarket dinner at night. Good tasty food. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/20/life-is-pain-highness-anyone-who-says-differently-is-selling-something/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>OK-bleedin-Computer? How stupid is the average Channel 4 viewer? Fat-bloated-prog-rock-whinge-fest pap voted the greatest album of all time? Maybe it isn't so shocking when you learn that they also voted The Verve (the Verve!) higher than Jimi Hendrix, The Smiths, The Stone Roses and The Doors.
