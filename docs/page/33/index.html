        <p>As a lot of you know, you can get a Digital version of RTÉ (including Widescreen) on Sky Digital and NTL. However you must have a Sky/NTL subscription to see it. Many people, including myself, believe this is fundamentally wrong as we already support RTÉ through the mandatory TV licence.
Please sign the petition from Brian Greene demanding that RTE make digital broadcasts of their programming available for &ldquo;free&rdquo;. If you are a blogger, consider adding the badge in support. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/22/sign-the-rte-digital-free-to-air-petition/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs. But, TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal. TB disease was once the leading cause of death in the United States.
TB is spread through the air from one person to another. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/20/220-children-to-get-chest-x-rays/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Given that this blog is six years old this week and we&rsquo;ve started reminiscing about the good old days of Engineering in Merrion Street and Earlsfort Terrace, I&rsquo;ve decided that it&rsquo;s officially Nostalgia Week here at O&rsquo;Neill Towers.
Knarf reminded me of Jimmy Jamjars at the gates to Merrion Street. Catherine reminded me of The Jimmy Jamjar Awards. I think Teresa won one in 1991 for the largest number of PFOs of any Engineering student. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/19/nostalgia-week-at-conoroneillcom/">&raquo;</a></p>

How wrong I was. The second blog post was 7th August 2001.
For the first 4 years, the blog mainly consisted of baby announcements of my friends and my job situation. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/17/six-years-a-bloggin-today/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Paul Brennan let me know the other day about a very worthwhile effort by his friend Hugh Bergin. Hugh is doing a motorbike trip from Kilkenny to Capetown. It is a personal trip but he&rsquo;s trying to raise some money for the charity Self Help. Self Help is an Irish development agency engaged in promoting and implementing integrated sustainable development programmes in rural Africa.
He started his journey late in 2006 and he is currently in the Congo region, still going strong and keeping a diary of his adventure. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/11/kilkenny-to-cape-town/">&raquo;</a></p>
