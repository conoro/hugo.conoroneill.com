            In January 2020, I went 99.9% plant-based as a way of kick-starting serious weight loss after 20 years of being either overweight or obese. The only initial exception was cow milk in my tea. I did similar back in 2016 but that was my silly &ldquo;6 Day Vegan&rdquo; plan where I ate chicken curry on a Friday. Both times I&rsquo;ve used Veganuary as the starting point.
After two months at 99.

            Has it really been 13 months since I did a personal blogpost? So many things I&rsquo;ve been meaning to share over the past year but never got around to. I&rsquo;ll make sure to do my annual race/run wrap-up post over Christmas and I really want to get back into the regular blogging saddle since I&rsquo;ve left Twitter and Facebook long behind.
And speaking of the two hellsites, this post by Sabrina Little on iRunFar is a perfect summary of how I have been feeling about online (and real-world) discourse over the past few years.

            The response to my rage-post about our treatment by Aer Lingus really resonated with a lot of people. Here&#39;s a few interesting tid-bits.

            I&rsquo;ve been calling Twitter the Hate Machine and LinkedIn a Roach Motel for a long time. But they both really came up trumps with my EI123 blogpost.
 Unsurprisingly it turns out that IAG airlines have been treating passengers like garbage all over Europe and they are getting worse by the day. I received a large number of stories both publicly and privately that show a company which seems to detest the people who keep them in business.

            One of my favourite sights in Ireland is when I&rsquo;m driving south on the M8 motorway and the Galtee Mountains appear on the horizon. At certain times of the year and day, it&rsquo;s breathtaking.
The 16yo and I had a fine time out there earlier in the year with Bandon Hillwalking Club on their Open Day but I wanted to find out how much of it was runnable by someone like me.

Let&rsquo;s do the timeline first and then dive into the death of once-well-regarded brand.
An early start but lots of excitement My wife, 5 kids and I woke at 4.

            If you don&rsquo;t have a Google Cardboard, you can still get some sense of the scale of what Alex Honnold achieved this year when he free soloed El Capitan in Yosemite if you use the 3D controls in YouTube.
Free Soloing is climbing without any equipment or safety ropes. What Alex did is one of the greatest sporting achievements by a human ever.
   I&rsquo;ve no massive interest in climbing but after watching the Valley Uprising documentary last night (available to buy or watch or Netflix), I have a whole new appreciation for the mindset and philosophy of people like Honnold and John Bachar before him.

&ldquo;I understand the disbelief and the need to explain what many deemed impossible without some kind of assistance. But what if, at the end of the day, as Alex Hutchinson wrote for Outside, it was all Kipchoge? What if we were simply watching the greatest distance runner of all-time painting his masterpiece in real-time? What if we were witnessing the greatest feat of human endurance in history?

            The Kerry Ultra 50K was somehow not on my radar but luckily my wife spotted it recently. We decided to do it barely a week beforehand.
Unlike a lot of ultras over in the UK, this one was all on-road and mostly self-supported. There was a small table every 10K with water and Redbull only.
We went down to Tralee the night before to make the race briefing. Brian O&rsquo;Shea went into huge detail on both the 50K and 100K which weirdly made me more stressed than if I&rsquo;d known nothing.
