        <p>On April 3rd I joined nearForm as Chief Product Officer. I genuinely believe nearForm is destined for all-time greatness and I want to contribute to that.
One of my career highlights so far was playing a part in the acquisition of FeedHenry by Red Hat. The day I found out that they were a potential buyer will always stay with me. I have had 2.5 amazing years with them and my opinion has only gone up as time progressed. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/04/06/on-joining-nearform-as-chief-product-officer/">&raquo;</a></p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>A few months back I was browsing the Coillte Outdoors site for forests in West Cork that looked good for running in. The two most promising ones I found were Warrenscourt Forest and Carrigfadda Hill.
Warrenscourt I&rsquo;ve done Warrenscourt Forest twice and I highly recommend it. You can access it from either the Warrenscourt end or Kilmurry end and both are very short drives off the N22 near Lissarda. Whilst it&rsquo;s quite steep in places, it&rsquo;s very runnable with some beautiful views along by the stream. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/03/22/carrigfadda-hill-and-warrenscourt-forest-are-two-brilliant-running-spots-in-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

And unlike a lot of running related things in recent years, it&rsquo;s an absolute bargain to take part. €10 annual membership and €5 for today&rsquo;s race.
I had no idea what to expect today. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/02/05/my-first-ever-imra-mmra-trail-run-in-castlefreke/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I talked about parkrun in my monster post last year on the future of Ireland&rsquo;s health. It was started in the UK in 2010 and has spread around the world. In parkrun Ireland there are over 50 events every week. You may have heard it mentioned on Operation Transformation too.
The idea is incredibly simple. Every Saturday at 9.30am, you turn up to your local parkrun and do 5km. You can sprint, run, jog, walk or amble. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/01/26/go-to-a-parkrun-this-saturday-in-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Four years ago I ran my first marathon, in Dublin, and it was a disaster. Everything seized up at the top of my right calf around mile 10, followed a few miles later by my left calf. I hobbled the remaining 16 miles in pain. It had never happened before and it hasn&rsquo;t happened since.
I thought that was the end of my marathon &ldquo;career&rdquo; and reverted to Halves and 10k&rsquo;s until last year. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/11/20/bringing-the-carnage-to-the-dublin-city-marathon-2016/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever Googled for video reviews of running shoes, you&rsquo;ve almost definitely landed on a review by The Ginger Runner, Ethan Newberry. For a long time, that was all I knew him for and I bought several pairs after confirming that he liked them. Then I discovered Ginger Runner Live, where he does long interviews with ultra runners live on YouTube. These are my goto podcasts whilst running slowly, along with Bad Boys Running, The Ultra Runner Podcast and Adam Buxton (who may not be a runner :-) ). <a class="read-more" href="/2016/11/20/why-we-need-more-events-like-ginger-runner-virtual-run-grvr16/">&raquo;</a></p>

However the more I thought about it, the bigger the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; got. What I&rsquo;m going to present here is obvious in many places, controversial in others and possibly pure fantasy. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/09/21/greenways-byways-hedgerows-tourism-and-the-future-of-irelands-health/">&raquo;</a></p>
