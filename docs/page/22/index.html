        <p>I love finding something great almost on your doorstep that you&rsquo;ve ignored for years. We finally took a trip to the Model Railway village last weekend and it was a resounding success. Kids, young and old will have some fun here.
I&rsquo;ve lost track of the number of times I&rsquo;ve said we must pop in for a look. The closest we got was some of the kids taking the road-train around Clon with their Granny last year. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/04/13/review-of-clonakilty-model-railway-village/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The bandon.ie blog has an important post about the Action Plan for the improvement of Bandon town centre. They have full details on what it&rsquo;s all about but the critical bit is having your say. Let the consultants who are drawing up the proposals know what you think should be done to improve the town. Some off the top of my head are:
 Finish the bypass (I know I know, this isn&rsquo;t in their remit) Improved street lighting, particularly on bypass Extended footpaths on all major routes out of town Changing junction priorities Traffic lights at top of Glasslyn Removal of some right turns in the town Better bus stops Encouraging the owners of all the land on Glasslyn to develop it Encouraging a new commercial indoor play area Presenting Bandon as a great location for hi-tech biz. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/04/01/an-important-one-for-bandon-residents/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We&rsquo;re just playing around with a few ideas on a site called Jaiku this morning (they were bought by Google a few months back). The idea is that you can have discussion channels on particular topics like technology, politics, Bandon GAA, whatever. What makes it (and other great sites like Twitter) so powerful is that you can interact with it entirely through SMS on your phone.
So this morning I created two non-techie ones that I thought might appeal to my more foodie readers. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/29/recipe-and-gardening-advice-by-sms-and-web/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I just had a comment on one of my posts from a girl in Coláiste Na Toirbhirte wondering about summer work vacancies in Bandon. If you have any, or know of businesses that take in summer students, maybe post a comment here or drop me a line at conor AT loudervoice DOT com and I&rsquo;ll pass the info on.
Are there any sites that provide some sort of service in Ireland for this? <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/28/companies-offering-summer-work-in-bandon/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I know there are tons of small businesses out there struggling with IT, even basics like anti-virus and e-mail. Unfortunately, lack of knowledge can often mean you aren&rsquo;t even aware that there are better and cheaper ways of doing what you are doing.
Last Autumn, the County Enterprise Boards launched Tech-Check to address this widespread problem. It&rsquo;s a simple but highly effective initiative to help businesses sort out their most pressing technology problems. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/19/have-a-small-business-and-need-it-help/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We finally made it down to our first St Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade in Bandon. The kids really enjoyed it (2 year old loved the tractors and fire engines). I was a bit surprised how short it was and the person beside me mentioned the lack of music. Face painting and balloon shapes went down very well. I wish I&rsquo;d managed to see all the old cars as the pristine Escort (Mexico? <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/19/bandon-parade/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I meant to write this post a few months back and was finally reminded to yesterday when I was in Cork Airport yet again.
The old airport carparks had the most unreliable equipment on the planet, pure third world garbage. I spent more time stuck in queues trying to get out of there due to malfunctioning barriers than any other airport, including Dublin which I have used more.
So you&rsquo;d think, when spending €180m on a new airport (and hoping we taxpayers will stump up the money for it), that they&rsquo;d find a supplier of equipment that, ye know, actually works. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/12/cork-airport-incompetence/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As someone who grew up in Kilkenny from the age of 6-18, I was very excited to see that Creative Camp is on this weekend. Not only that, but it&rsquo;s on in the wonderful Kilkenny Castle where I spent many a day trying to find secret tunnels as a kid.
If you are wondering what it is all about, the idea is that the attendees are the presenters. It is in the BarCamp tradition of &ldquo;unconferences&rdquo; where the agenda for the day is very much made up on the day. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/06/creative-camp-comes-to-kilkenny/">&raquo;</a></p>
