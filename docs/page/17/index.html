        <p>Whilst growing up from age 6-18 in Kilkenny, one group of people I never got on with were the park-keepers (&ldquo;parkies&rdquo;) in the Castle Park. They always seemed to be fun-killers.
It looks like nothing has changed in over 20 years. I watched at least 50 people walk away gutted from the park yesterday with bawling children due to this:
One person claimed it was because a child had slipped and hurt themselves on the previous day. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/12/28/frost-stops-play/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>So 47 farms used contaminated pig feed. Unless the FSAI confirms that Gubbeen or Caherbeg are two of those farms, I&rsquo;ll be having a lovely bacon sarnie for my breakfast.
If the State&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer says that dioxin is only dangerous if a person is exposed to it over a long period of time, then why the hell are we destroying millions of Euro worth of food?
We all eat chicken that spends its life sitting in its own faeces in the dark and lots of the pork we eat is dosed up to the eyeballs in sub-therapeutic antibiotics, so how is a slight possibility of a touch of PCB going to make our health any worse? <a class="read-more" href="/2008/12/07/having-some-nice-rashers-for-breakfast/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>You eagle-eyed West Cork drivers may have noticed a big new sign on the back of one of the units behind Great Gas on the Bandon Bypass. It is the retail/warehouse outlet of newly launched Curious Wines. Mike Kane, the owner, has put together a brilliant selection of wines which are not your usual supermarket generic stuff.
Their web-site has just gone live and it&rsquo;s a corker (boom! boom!). Another stunning creation by the shockingly talented Ms Dent. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/11/19/curious-wines-launches/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>When the Irish Blog Awards nominations open early next year, I&rsquo;m pretty sure Ivan McCutcheon&rsquo;s recent post about local West Cork abbatoirs and butchers will be the one I pick.
If you care about the food you put in your gob and appreciate the work of people with a passion for their craft, read Ivan&rsquo;s piece, print it off and give it to those you know.
For so many reasons, it is imperative that businesses like Dan Maloney&rsquo;s in Bandon survive and thrive. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/11/19/blog-post-of-the-year/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have no excuse for the lack of posting here other than the usual busy-ness of life. I&rsquo;ll get back into writing mode very soon. Lots of blogposts and book reviews in my head, I just need to get them out through my fingers.
Speaking of reviews, I hope my loyal readers don&rsquo;t mind me doing a very quick bit of blatant promotion of LouderVoice. We have just kicked off our 2008 BES offering. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/10/23/regular-service-will-resume-soon/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I&rsquo;ve just had an absolutely perfect seafood lunch in Fishy Fishy with my parents. Incredible fresh seafood at reasonable prices with attentive staff. The only downside was an excess of ladies-who-lunch trying-too-hard.
I have never ever heard a bad word about the original Fishy Fishy. Everything about it sounded great except the small number of tables which resulted in long waits. As we are usually with-childer, that&rsquo;s not an option. My parents popped down for a visit and brought me out for lunch today to their new location looking out on the harbour. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/10/03/fabby-fashiony-fishy-fishy/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We&rsquo;ve had a couple of very good reviews of Mio on LouderVoice and finally got a chance to try it out last Sunday. A brilliant meal in a beautiful but shockingly empty restaurant. We&rsquo;ll be back soon.
Granny Mary shooed us out the door at 5pm on Sunday and we tootled down to Clon to Mio&rsquo;s. Owned by the same people as the brilliant Gleenson&rsquo;s, it is two doors up and upstairs. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/10/03/oh-mio-mai-o/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For some reason I completely missed that this was coming. Thanks to Mary Wedel for letting me know. From Fri 26th to Sun 28th September, we&rsquo;re having an Arts Festival in Bandon. Things were actually kicked off on Thursday with the CruX Dance Company in the Town Hall. There will also be an exhibition of local artists in the Miriam Bailey Gallery from Wed 24th. 
The line-up next weekend is below. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/09/21/engage-arts-festival-bandon/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Like blogs? Like wine? Then Julian over at Bubble Brothers is having a wee tasting this coming Thursday. All details over on the blog. &gt; This coming Thursday, 25th September, Emilio Saez van Eerd of Casa de las Vides and Javier Navarro from Tintoralba (earlier tasting summarized in this post) will be making a flying visit to us, and I’d like to give them and their wines as much publicity as possible. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/09/21/wine-tasting-in-bubble-brothers/">&raquo;</a></p>
