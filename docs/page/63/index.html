        <p>I finally did it - down to Union Hall with all four of the darlings and we bought a lobster. Poor Ois nearly had a heart attack when the guy in the shop leaped towards him with the lobster in his hand! Oscar just wanted to know how I was going to kill it. That kid worries me sometimes.
So here he is, just home, Spongebob.

        <p>I don&rsquo;t want this blog to turn into a list of great people who have died, but I&rsquo;ve just read that Richard Pryor has passed away.
There is an excellent obituary on the Washington Post site.
Lovely quotes on Yahoo.
And if you&rsquo;ve never heard him at his foul-mouthed best, you can listen to some clips on Amazon- hell go buy the box set whilst you are at it.
He was one of those guys who just made you laugh by standing on stage. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/11/theres-nothing-worse-than-being-an-aging-young-person/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve just cooked up the smoked rashers that Catherine got in Urru during the week. They were gorgeous. I was surprised when I opened the pack to see that it did not contain a few thick rashers but lots of very thinly cut ones. This is exactly the way I like them - I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of those thick cut things which often end up a chewy as old boots. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/10/ummera-smoked-rashers-taste-tastic/">&raquo;</a></p>

The Inquirer has an short article on the death of the son of the founder of Philips at the age of 100. They mention what he was in charge of in his heyday. The same name was on a giant sign which you passed in the train on the way into the city from Amsterdam. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/07/one-of-the-best-ever-words-in-a-foreign-language/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I was gutted to read in CAR that LJK Setright passed away recently. I started reading CAR when I was 14 years old and continue to do so despite his absence for the past few years.
As a kid, I checked out most of the motoring magazines and CAR was the only one I read where I felt I was learning something, rather than just reading pseudo-ads. For a short while in the late 80&rsquo;s I tried Performance Car but to be honest that was only because of Clarkson. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/07/ljk-passes-away/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>An old old friend (bet ya like that description Jane) is living over in Frankfurt. Her hubby has just finished McCarthy&rsquo;s Bar and is dying to visit the place mentioned in the book which he describes as an ex-church or nunnery in a small town near Cork, on the coast, known for it&rsquo;s good cuisine.
I have no idea where he is talking about and Googling only brings up the actual McCarthy&rsquo;s Bar in Castletownbere. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/05/an-ex-church-or-nunnery-in-a-small-town-near-cork-from-mccarthys-bar/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have a wee bee in my bonnet about how difficult it is to get good fresh fish in the &ldquo;greater Bandon area&rdquo;. When we moved down here, I thought I would have fish coming out of my ears (as opposed to sleeping with the fishes). But it was the complete opposite.
The SuperValu in the town has a small fish counter but you can never rely on it to have anything you want. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/04/hey-dad-thats-the-same-ugly-fish-as-last-week/">&raquo;</a></p>
