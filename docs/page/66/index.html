So here he is, just home, Spongebob.

        <p>I don&rsquo;t want this blog to turn into a list of great people who have died, but I&rsquo;ve just read that Richard Pryor has passed away.
There is an excellent obituary on the Washington Post site.
Lovely quotes on Yahoo.
And if you&rsquo;ve never heard him at his foul-mouthed best, you can listen to some clips on Amazon- hell go buy the box set whilst you are at it.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve just cooked up the smoked rashers that Catherine got in Urru during the week. They were gorgeous. I was surprised when I opened the pack to see that it did not contain a few thick rashers but lots of very thinly cut ones. This is exactly the way I like them - I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of those thick cut things which often end up a chewy as old boots. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/10/ummera-smoked-rashers-taste-tastic/">&raquo;</a></p>

The Inquirer has an short article on the death of the son of the founder of Philips at the age of 100. They mention what he was in charge of in his heyday.

        <p>I was gutted to read in CAR that LJK Setright passed away recently. I started reading CAR when I was 14 years old and continue to do so despite his absence for the past few years.
As a kid, I checked out most of the motoring magazines and CAR was the only one I read where I felt I was learning something, rather than just reading pseudo-ads. For a short while in the late 80&rsquo;s I tried Performance Car but to be honest that was only because of Clarkson. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/07/ljk-passes-away/">&raquo;</a></p>
