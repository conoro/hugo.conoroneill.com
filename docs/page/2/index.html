        <p>This is going to be a post full of superlatives.
When I first heard about Surf Turf n Tar, I was instantly excited. I&rsquo;d done most of the course in chunks already and it&rsquo;s currently my favourite place to run. You have every sort of terrain and views, all in a compact area.
The race started just opposite the Celtic Ross Hotel and headed down a little road. You hear of elite ultra runners &ldquo;blowing-up&rdquo; at 50 miles. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/05/21/rosscarbery-surf-turf-n-tar-an-instant-classic-half-marathon/">&raquo;</a></p>

MCI Marathon Ballina We joined the Marathon Club of Ireland last year and I&rsquo;ve been very impressed by the number of events they organise. They have so many amazing athletes who have done 25, 50, 100 and even 200+ marathons.
On the 25th of February, they arranged 3 Marathons in 2 days in Mayo. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/05/01/conors-roundup-of-recent-runs/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The only thing you need to run is a pair of running shoes. And some people even get by without those. This is regularly driven home to me by the guy in his GAA top/shorts and knackered shoes who laps me in parkRun.

        <p>On April 3rd I joined nearForm as Chief Product Officer. I genuinely believe nearForm is destined for all-time greatness and I want to contribute to that.
One of my career highlights so far was playing a part in the acquisition of FeedHenry by Red Hat. The day I found out that they were a potential buyer will always stay with me. I have had 2.5 amazing years with them and my opinion has only gone up as time progressed. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/04/06/on-joining-nearform-as-chief-product-officer/">&raquo;</a></p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>A few months back I was browsing the Coillte Outdoors site for forests in West Cork that looked good for running in. The two most promising ones I found were Warrenscourt Forest and Carrigfadda Hill.
Warrenscourt I&rsquo;ve done Warrenscourt Forest twice and I highly recommend it. You can access it from either the Warrenscourt end or Kilmurry end and both are very short drives off the N22 near Lissarda. Whilst it&rsquo;s quite steep in places, it&rsquo;s very runnable with some beautiful views along by the stream. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/03/22/carrigfadda-hill-and-warrenscourt-forest-are-two-brilliant-running-spots-in-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I only learned of the Irish Mountain Running Assocation (and Munster Mountain Running Association branch) last year. They have an extensive line-up of events all year from hard-core 127km Ultras to family friendly events like today&rsquo;s run in Castlefreke Woods and Long Strand.
And unlike a lot of running related things in recent years, it&rsquo;s an absolute bargain to take part. €10 annual membership and €5 for today&rsquo;s race.
I had no idea what to expect today. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/02/05/my-first-ever-imra-mmra-trail-run-in-castlefreke/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I talked about parkrun in my monster post last year on the future of Ireland&rsquo;s health. It was started in the UK in 2010 and has spread around the world. In parkrun Ireland there are over 50 events every week. You may have heard it mentioned on Operation Transformation too.
The idea is incredibly simple. Every Saturday at 9.30am, you turn up to your local parkrun and do 5km. You can sprint, run, jog, walk or amble. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/01/26/go-to-a-parkrun-this-saturday-in-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I first learned of the Montane Spine Race last year when there were some mentions online of an Irish guy winning some insanely long race and breaking the record. This turned out to be Eoin Keith who is an amazing ultra runner. He had to pull out this year in third position after breaking a rib near the start. He waited 170 miles to do so :-)

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Four years ago I ran my first marathon, in Dublin, and it was a disaster. Everything seized up at the top of my right calf around mile 10, followed a few miles later by my left calf. I hobbled the remaining 16 miles in pain. It had never happened before and it hasn&rsquo;t happened since.
I thought that was the end of my marathon &ldquo;career&rdquo; and reverted to Halves and 10k&rsquo;s until last year. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/11/20/bringing-the-carnage-to-the-dublin-city-marathon-2016/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever Googled for video reviews of running shoes, you&rsquo;ve almost definitely landed on a review by The Ginger Runner, Ethan Newberry. For a long time, that was all I knew him for and I bought several pairs after confirming that he liked them. Then I discovered Ginger Runner Live, where he does long interviews with ultra runners live on YouTube. These are my goto podcasts whilst running slowly, along with Bad Boys Running, The Ultra Runner Podcast and Adam Buxton (who may not be a runner :-) ). <a class="read-more" href="/2016/11/20/why-we-need-more-events-like-ginger-runner-virtual-run-grvr16/">&raquo;</a></p>
