        <p>It&rsquo;s been a while, I know. I spent most of 2013 focused on my tech blog over here. But I thought I&rsquo;d kick off 2014 with a foodie post. I use a lot of hot sauce but tend to be very boring in the ones I buy, mainly sticking to the supermarket reliables like Tabasco and Encona. I&rsquo;ve got the odd Irish one too but many of them seem obsessed with heat and not flavour (Rebel Chilli being the worst culprit here). <a class="read-more" href="/2014/01/01/two-lovely-hot-sauces-from-mexico/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For a good few years, this blog was all about food. I had lots of restaurant reviews and foodie pics and experiments like making sausages. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, I haven&rsquo;t done much in that area for a long time. Whilst I&rsquo;ve eaten lots of lovely food since then, I haven&rsquo;t had much that was truly memorable. Until Friday night. My parents were down for a visit and we planned to go to The Poacher&rsquo;s Inn with them and big sis, but when we went to book we were told the Tapas night was starting at 8pm and it was only a very limited menu before that. <a class="read-more" href="/2013/03/03/poachers-inn-tapas-night-staggeringly-good-epic-in-fact/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Brian Greene contacted me last week about a new project he has just launched called Tuairisc.me. Like many good ideas, it&rsquo;s brilliantly simple. It&rsquo;s an anti-bullying form for school web-sites that can be added with a single line of HTML to any site. I sent some questions/thoughts over to Brian and his responses convinced me that this thing has legs. But it will only work if as many people as possible know about it. <a class="read-more" href="/2013/01/29/doing-something-about-bullying-tuairisc/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We recently did a short family outing to the forest in Castlefreke just before the kids went back to school. Whilst the walk itself was fun and short enough to avoid the kids complaining too much, it brought up a ton of questions and ideas in my head, such as: Why is it so hard to find detailed information about walks/trails in West Cork and the rest of the country? The Irish Trails site is very poor indeed. <a class="read-more" href="/2013/01/14/ballincolligs-permanent-orienteering-trail-points-the-way-for-all-west-cork-towns/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I thought I&rsquo;d have a quick peek at my running stats this morning. Last year was pretty good and I&rsquo;ve managed to start 2013 a whole 6 lbs lighter than I started 2012. Having said that, lots and lots of weight to be lost this year. I started &ldquo;running&rdquo; back in 2009. It was not an auspicious beginning. 2009 28.43km 2010 435.81km Timoleague: First 10km Half Marathons: Dingle, Galway 2011 394.39km First road race in Vibram Five Fingers Half Marathons: Bandon, Amsterdam 2012 849.41 10kms: Bandon Half Marathons: Cork, Clonakilty First Marathon: Dublin 2013 Second Marathon: Location TBD I never did a blogpost on the Dublin Marathon. <a class="read-more" href="/2013/01/02/three-full-years-a-running-and-my-first-marathon/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It&rsquo;s great to see Cork CoCo finally putting an Alerts system in place. It&rsquo;s very easy to use. You simply go to the relevant Map Alerts site and register there with your mobile/email/etc. You can also add your home and work locations for alerts. Right now they are doing Alerts for Met Eireann Severe Weather Warnings in all of the County and for Flood Warnings in Clonakilty. I assume they&rsquo;ll eventually integrate Bandon FEWS in too rather than running two separate systems. <a class="read-more" href="/2012/11/12/new-alerting-system-from-cork-county-council/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Bandon Coder Dojo kicked off this year and they have just made the move to St Brogans school at the top of the town. It&rsquo;s on every Tuesday from 6:30pm to 8pm. They are currently focused on Scratch, HTML and JavaScript. If you have any skills in those areas, they would really appreciate more mentors taking part. Our eldest has just started using Scratch and is finding it good fun. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot: You currently need to have a laptop to take part in Coder Dojo. <a class="read-more" href="/2012/10/21/bandon-coder-dojo-on-the-move/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>My two favourite products working together to make me run like the wind (cough). When I switched from running in Bikilas to these TrekSports, I started getting a sore spot just behind the ball of my left foot. It appears to be due to a seam on the VFFs rubbing me. Using a temporary pad worked during the week so now I&rsquo;m hoping this Sugru fix will be permanent. I have to run 5 miles tonight so that should prove it one way or another. <a class="read-more" href="/2012/08/31/finally-together-at-last-vibram-five-fingers-and-sugru/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Timoleague was formerly a place of some note, being much resorted to by the Spaniards, who imported large quantities of wine here and it is said there were formerly no less than fourteen taverns that sold sack in the town. Looking at the wide slob lands when the tide is out, or the shallow waters at full tide, it is hard to believe that here was once a busy Medieval port where foreign merchants from France and Spain bartered their wines and Mediterranean produce for Irish butter, hides and farm produce In Timoleague&rsquo;s case, the harbour silted up through no fault of the town. <a class="read-more" href="/2012/07/12/without-fibre-bandon-will-suffer-timoleagues-fate/">&raquo;</a></p>
