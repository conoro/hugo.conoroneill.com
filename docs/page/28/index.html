        <p>Looks like the Science Week guys are hardcore! They&rsquo;ve hired Edelman to help with PR. I like the idea they came up with. Basically Irish Bloggers have to answer some stuff about their favourite inventions as blog posts during the coming week and we might win a Wii.
Today&rsquo;s question is &ldquo;What was the favourite invention from your childhood&rdquo;.
This is an easy one. The home computer, specifically the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/13/more-science-week-stuff/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t normally mention posts that I write on blognation over here but I think this one is probably of great interest to many of my local readers and those in more rural locations in Ireland and the UK.
A company called 3G Doctor in Kerry provides a service whereby you can get a video consultantion with a qualified doctor using your 3G phone.
I&rsquo;ve written all about it here. I&rsquo;d be interested to hear what you think and whether the 3G coverage is good enough yet so that it is useful to the people who need it most. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/07/3g-doctor-signals-the-return-of-house-visits/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There is a wonderful bunch of things planned in Cork as part of Science Week which will hopefully increase the interest in science amongst kids. The target audience is 10-16 year olds but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll drag our 8 year old along to some of it.
It is on from 11th Nov to 18th Nov in various locations around the city. I believe the HQ is City Hall and local tech companies will have stands there. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/10/27/science-week-in-november/">&raquo;</a></p>
