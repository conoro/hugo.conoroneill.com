        <p>I wrote about my first 50k a few weeks back. I still smile every time I think about it. I&rsquo;m already signed up for a 40 miler in the Glen of Aherlow in September (3 loops, so I have a get-out-of-jail) and I&rsquo;m trying to decide what my first 50 miler will be. Suffice to say, I&rsquo;m really getting into this whole trail running thing. And one of the main reasons for that is the brilliant work done by YouTubers, Instagrammers and Podcasters in this area. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/08/30/review-of-the-trail-runners-companion-by-sarah-lavender-smith/">&raquo;</a></p>

Any chance we can narrow &quot;inspirational&quot; to mean &quot;inspired me to action&quot; instead of &quot;isn&#39;t that a nice story&quot;?
&mdash; Conor O&#39;Neill (@conoro) July 19, 2017 
It was partially driven by the silly overuse of &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; but also by the fact that I was inspired to run 50km last weekend by all of the amazing Ultrarunners in the US and Europe and the stories they tell via YouTube, Vimeo, Blogs, Twitter, Instagram, magazines and books. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/07/23/the-chiltern-challenge-50k-conors-first-ultra-marathon/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned as I&rsquo;ve dipped my toe into off-road running in Ireland is that we don&rsquo;t really do trails. Apart from forest paths, the bulk of what I&rsquo;ve found is wet muddy bog. This causes me two problems - it&rsquo;s difficult to run in it and American-style trail runners are useless in this environment. My poor Altra Lone Peak 3.0 may as well be slick tyres coming down from Mullaghmesha Mountain. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/06/11/quick-reviews-of-inov8-xclaw-275-trail-runners-leki-voyager-poles/">&raquo;</a></p>

When I first heard about Surf Turf n Tar, I was instantly excited. I&rsquo;d done most of the course in chunks already and it&rsquo;s currently my favourite place to run. You have every sort of terrain and views, all in a compact area.
The race started just opposite the Celtic Ross Hotel and headed down a little road. You hear of elite ultra runners &ldquo;blowing-up&rdquo; at 50 miles. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/05/21/rosscarbery-surf-turf-n-tar-an-instant-classic-half-marathon/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>A few months back I was browsing the Coillte Outdoors site for forests in West Cork that looked good for running in. The two most promising ones I found were Warrenscourt Forest and Carrigfadda Hill.
Warrenscourt I&rsquo;ve done Warrenscourt Forest twice and I highly recommend it. You can access it from either the Warrenscourt end or Kilmurry end and both are very short drives off the N22 near Lissarda. Whilst it&rsquo;s quite steep in places, it&rsquo;s very runnable with some beautiful views along by the stream. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/03/22/carrigfadda-hill-and-warrenscourt-forest-are-two-brilliant-running-spots-in-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

And unlike a lot of running related things in recent years, it&rsquo;s an absolute bargain to take part. €10 annual membership and €5 for today&rsquo;s race.

        <p>I talked about parkrun in my monster post last year on the future of Ireland&rsquo;s health. It was started in the UK in 2010 and has spread around the world. In parkrun Ireland there are over 50 events every week. You may have heard it mentioned on Operation Transformation too.
The idea is incredibly simple. Every Saturday at 9.30am, you turn up to your local parkrun and do 5km. You can sprint, run, jog, walk or amble. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/01/26/go-to-a-parkrun-this-saturday-in-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>
