        <p>We don't have it too bad for restaurants down here in Cork. We've had great meals in Gleesons in Clonakilty, Casino House in Kilbrittain and Broly's in Bandon. Unfortunately most of the places in Bandon target the lower end of the Market and it's nice to see Broly's trying something better. It is a coffee shop/cafe during the day and they re-jig for more upmarket dinner at night. Good tasty food. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/20/life-is-pain-highness-anyone-who-says-differently-is-selling-something/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>OK-bleedin-Computer? How stupid is the average Channel 4 viewer? Fat-bloated-prog-rock-whinge-fest pap voted the greatest album of all time? Maybe it isn't so shocking when you learn that they also voted The Verve (the Verve!) higher than Jimi Hendrix, The Smiths, The Stone Roses and The Doors.

        <p>We are nearly a week into our Sky+ Box ownership. It's not often something far exceeds your expectation but this bloody thing does so with ease. The wee beauty can record two channels at the same time. There is some very impressive buffer management going on in there. We have set a bunch of recordings of weekly shows plus any movies that catch my eye no matter what time they start. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/17/and-wuv-tru-wuv-will-fowow-you-foweva/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Finally got around to collecting together the list of other bits of software I use (mainly at home). But first off, I should be given a thorough thrashing for not including XEmacs in the first list. I first encountered XEmacs on HP-UX in Philips Eindhoven in 1995\. Up until then I had used the VAX editor and a few crappy freeware PC ones. This thing was a revelation - syntax highlighting, tons of extensions, call-out to make, gcc, whatever. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/15/there-is-something-you-dont-know-i-am-not-left-handed/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Nostalgia time, 80's fans. Due to unprecedented public demand (currently at zero requests), I am making available my classic ZX Spectrum games at no cost. Each of these 4K masterpieces, which took months of pubescent angst to complete, requires either an actual ZX Spectrum or an emulator to play. My two favourite emulators are [EmuZWin](http://bonanzas.rinet.ru/apps/EmuZWin_Eng.htm) and [ZXSpin](http://www.zxspin.co.uk/). The current version of ZXSpin seems to have some problem finding ROMs so maybe stick with EmuZWin for the moment. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/14/you-rush-a-miracle-man-you-get-rotten-miracles/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I keep a "link-blog" over at [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/blog/bandon1). It is just a set of links to other peoples blog postings and sites with stories that caught my eye. I'll put a permanent link to it on this blog when I get a chance. Overall I'm happy with Bloglines but I'm tired of old posts constantly re-appearing as new. Is Feedburner any better in this regard I wonder?  <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/13/never-get-involved-in-a-land-war-in-asia/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was watching The Princess Bride for the gazillionth time the other night and had forgotten how many great one liners it has. So the next few postings are all going to have completely unrelated titles from that movie. Last year I bought a Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350 video capture card. The main reason was to transfer an ancient (vintage 1980) family video to DVD and also to transfer all our Sony HandyCam Video-8 to DVD. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/12/unemployed-in-greenland/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I never got into the US version of The Apprentice. I think mainly because I've always thought of Trump as a tacky buffoon. I remember being brought to Trump Towers in 1987 by my American cousin (whirlwind tour of NY in one day including WTC, St Patrick's Cathederal and The Statue of Liberty) and thinking - how can you spend so much money and end up with a place looking so cheap? <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/04/the-apprentice-uk/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Not flu - vicious throat infection and tonsil infection. Still in bits. Still agony to swallow saliva. So up late again. I got a new twin-CPU machine in work on Wednesday. I decided to write a list of all of the tools I definitely needed to install on it in addition to the corporate installs. I assumed it it would be 10 or 15\. Bloody hell, more like 40\. Some are obvious, others are quite nichey. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/03/23/favourite-software-tools/">&raquo;</a></p>
