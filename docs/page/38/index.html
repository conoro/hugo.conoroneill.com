        <p>Just spotted on the BBC that The Jesus and Mary Chain are re-forming to do some festival. I bloody loved that band. Psychocandy is in my top ten albums of all time. I remember playing it to my friends in 1985 and they all laughed at me. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s just noise Conor&rdquo;. &ldquo;Wait, just wait, you&rsquo;ll see. This is genius&rdquo;.
Any movie that uses their music gets an instant thumbs up from me. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/25/i-didnt-even-know-they-had-split-up/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It appears the opposition parties have started their campaign to lose the next general election with their latest himbo/bimbo scheme which they picked up from the UK. They want traffic lights on food to indicate the levels of salt, sugar and fat. Not only are the stuck in the 1980&rsquo;s with the fat obsession, but they show such a basic mis-understanding of human nature that the scheme was obviously devised by a marxist. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/25/traffic-lights-on-food-give-me-patience/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My Dad kindly voted for this blog in several categories in the Blog Awards earlier. He mailed me to say that it reminded him of my Granny (Mary O&rsquo;Neill) who voted for Dev eight times in the 1932 elections on both sides of the bridge in New Ross. Could you imagine if those old Cumann na mBan women were around now and decided to help the blog result?

        <p>As with all the previous episodes, this one is a zinger even if you were a C64 or (god forbid) Dragon user. I had stopped my involvement with home computers by 1987, what with being in college and discovering drink instead. So I found it particularly interesting that they mention a game called &ldquo;Head Over Heels&rdquo; which was considered by many to be the greatest example of its genre ever created. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/06/your-sinclair-rock-n-roll-years-1987-is-out/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We discovered over Christmas that you can in fact put 5 children, 2 adults and all their stuff in a Zafira+Roofbox and go from Cork to Kilkenny to Cavan to Cork. Hurrah.
On our trip back from Cavan on the joke&rsquo;s of national routes known as the N55 and N62, we got to Roscrea and Oscar decided to puke. We caught most of it in a nappy bag and then I dropped the bag as I exited it from the car. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/06/thank-you-dave/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been getting lots of contraceptive advice from men my age. It seems the only logical route is vasectomy. One of my best advisors had his done quite a while back with no adverse effects. There is only one guy in Cork who does it, Dr Pillay on Patrick St and he highly recommended him. He also (quietly) mentioned that performance would not be affected and I wouldn&rsquo;t be shooting blanks for the first thirty. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/05/you-may-feel-a-small-prick/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>So Haydn tagged me. Five things you don&rsquo;t know about me eh? Apart from my Spaghetti Hoop fetish?
1. I was Junior Irish Archery Champion in 1980. Not as impressive as it sounds. Three of us in the competition and other two were beginners. Never improved after that and gave up in mid-teens. Turns out not everyone else saw a blob of colours down the end of the field and I later found out I was short-sighted. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/03/curses-tagged/">&raquo;</a></p>
