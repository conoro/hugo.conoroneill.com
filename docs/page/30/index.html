        <p>I cannot understand why Christy O&rsquo;Sullivan thinks he&rsquo;ll get a vote from me. Here is a guy shoe-horned in by FF at a national level who sends me flyers with absolutely no information on them about who he is, what he believes in, where he lives, what he has accomplished as a politician or why I should vote for him.
And of course his website doesn&rsquo;t load!
Inserting this nobody over a well known local politician like Alan Coleman is a huge mistake by FF. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/22/how-not-to-get-my-vote/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As a lot of you know, you can get a Digital version of RTÉ (including Widescreen) on Sky Digital and NTL. However you must have a Sky/NTL subscription to see it. Many people, including myself, believe this is fundamentally wrong as we already support RTÉ through the mandatory TV licence.
Please sign the petition from Brian Greene demanding that RTE make digital broadcasts of their programming available for &ldquo;free&rdquo;. If you are a blogger, consider adding the badge in support. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/22/sign-the-rte-digital-free-to-air-petition/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>due to the TB outbreak in Cork.
 Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs. But, TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal. TB disease was once the leading cause of death in the United States.
TB is spread through the air from one person to another. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/20/220-children-to-get-chest-x-rays/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Given that this blog is six years old this week and we&rsquo;ve started reminiscing about the good old days of Engineering in Merrion Street and Earlsfort Terrace, I&rsquo;ve decided that it&rsquo;s officially Nostalgia Week here at O&rsquo;Neill Towers.
Knarf reminded me of Jimmy Jamjars at the gates to Merrion Street. Catherine reminded me of The Jimmy Jamjar Awards. I think Teresa won one in 1991 for the largest number of PFOs of any Engineering student. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/19/nostalgia-week-at-conoroneillcom/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>So he is only five years old and this was his first ever GAA session.
He reported back that he played hurling and soccer. His Nana from Meath better have a word with him about Gaelic Football.
Next week we are sending him in Kilkenny gear to shake things up a bit ;-)
Bloody hell, now I have two hurlers in the house. Who would ever have thought? <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/18/im-playing-gaa-like-rooney/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>17th April 2001, I got an account on this thing I probably heard about on Slashdot called Blogger. I just saw it as an easier way of keeping my personal homepage (which I think I started in 1996 on Indigo) up-to-date.
How wrong I was. The second blog post was 7th August 2001.
For the first 4 years, the blog mainly consisted of baby announcements of my friends and my job situation. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/17/six-years-a-bloggin-today/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Paul Brennan let me know the other day about a very worthwhile effort by his friend Hugh Bergin. Hugh is doing a motorbike trip from Kilkenny to Capetown. It is a personal trip but he&rsquo;s trying to raise some money for the charity Self Help. Self Help is an Irish development agency engaged in promoting and implementing integrated sustainable development programmes in rural Africa.
He started his journey late in 2006 and he is currently in the Congo region, still going strong and keeping a diary of his adventure. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/11/kilkenny-to-cape-town/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was a bit sad today to read this from the UCD Alumni office:
 UCD will soon be saying goodbye to Earlsfort Terrace and completing the move to Belfield. Generations of students spent their university years at the Terrace and hold fond memories of that time. This year, the last medical and engineering students will make the journey to Belfield and the Terrace will transfer to the National Concert Hall for major redevelopment as a multipurpose concert venue. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/11/universities-belong-inside-cities/">&raquo;</a></p>
