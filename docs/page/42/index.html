        <p>At this stage a huge number of people have camera phones and actually use the camera to take those impromptu pictures. I remember asking why anyone would want a camera phone three years ago. What the hell would you take pictures of? Well, it turns out I had no imagination and I now take pictures of everything and anything.
Now most people take the picture and either send it by MMS to friends n family or just show it on the phone to people later. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/15/pictures-camera-phones-picture-editing-and-that-internet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Handed down through generations of sufi mystics and carried by the Priory of Sion to Bandon where it remained undiscovered in a secret vault until excavations found the ancient stone etchings, I can now reveal the best chicken tikka masala recipe on the planet.
More accurately, I was given a stocking-filler cookbook by my sister years ago which came with packets of spices. It did lay undiscovered for over five years until I finally used it to make a tikka paste and then used their recipe for chicken tikka. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/13/conors-ultra-secret-chicken-tikka-masala-recipe/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>If you live anywhere in the Cork/Waterford/Tipp area and have fixed line broadband with any provider then you may have been having problems since last Friday. I was getting 40 kbs instead of 2 mbs since Monday rendering the internet connection almost useless. Eircom fixed it for their customers yesterday and fixed it for their competitors this morning. Normal service should have returned everywhere. Yet another reason for us all to switch over to Wimax and HSDPA wireless broadband when it gets rolled out rather than using a set of providers who clearly couldn&rsquo;t give a damn. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/12/broadband-is-back/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Oisín continues to come out with the funniest lines in the house. He refused to eat his dinner yesterday on the grounds that it was food for cats. Were we trying to feed him Whiskas perhaps? Or maybe KiteKat or Iams? No, it was lasagne.
All of this because his older brother, in an effort to get him to eat it, pointed out that lasagne is what Garfield eats. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/09/im-not-eating-that-its-for-cats/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Two of my favourite automotive blogs used to be Autoblog and Jalopnik. I had to unsubscribe from both due to the huge number of posts they were doing daily which I just could not keep up with (same reason I only lasted a few weeks with Blogorrah).
Alex Algard mailed me last week to tell me about a new car blog that he has launched called CarDomain Blog. I have to say it is the dogs for over-aged car nuts like me. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/06/new-car-blog/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I love paying €3 to fly to Gatwick but the thought of them running trans-Atlantic flights makes my blood run cold. How many Bullseyes do they think they could sell to the average punter over 5 hours to deaden the headache caused by the yellow everywhere?
On the upside, I&rsquo;d happily pay €5 an hour to have a PSP embedded in the seat back in front of me. But will he really do that? <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/05/oh-no-can-you-imagine-flying-ryanairlingus-to-the-us/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I heard the other day that Alan Sugar and Michelle Dewberry have parted ways. What a shocker. If that is Sugar at his people skills best then it&rsquo;s pretty obvious why he never went global.
All together now Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger.
YouTube currently down? They must have forgotten to pay their bills to Eircom.

        <p>You may have noted my lack of posting on my various blogs recently. The main reason for this is that I was helping to organise a free technology conference in Cork called BarCamp. BarCamps are neither about booze nor barristers but are grass-roots unconferences where the agenda is only decided on the day by attendees putting themselves forward to speak or to moderate sessions on topics they are interested in. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/03/non-technical-unconferences/">&raquo;</a></p>
