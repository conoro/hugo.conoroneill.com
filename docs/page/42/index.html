A lot of Sky customers don&rsquo;t know that there are many other free channels accessible on the various Astra satellites (like the good old analogue days) which you can programme into your Sky Digibox. From talking to other parents, by far the most popular of these has to be CBBC and CBeebies. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/30/cbbc-cbeebies-and-utv-on-sky-digital/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Leslie Dowdall is playing The Brogan Inn in Bandon soon!
Pause, little shudder of excitement, continue.
For those of you too young to remember, Leslie was to many Irish men who are now in their late thirties, the 1980&rsquo;s equivalent of Jessica Alba. I&rsquo;m not sure if Hot Press had pull-out posters of her, but they should have. She sang with a band called In Tua Nua who were famous for 6 months in Grangemockler (five miles from Windgap). <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/29/irish-men-of-a-certain-age-brace-yourselves/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Cork-&gt;Rosslare, Rosslare-&gt;Cork on a Bank Holiday Weekend. Number of cops encountered? Big fat zero. Number of hard-of-thinking suicidal cretins encountered? 4.
Oh but they did arrest over 100 drunk drivers today. Keep that up for 365 days a year and maybe it&rsquo;ll be something other than a reflection of their day-to-day incompetence as they waste taxpayers money snaring people doing 45 in 40 zones on bypasses across the country.

Hey, I&rsquo;ve got a great idea, €5 per beach walk from 9pm to 5.30pm with a half day on Saturday.
But the nice new pastry place goes some way towards making up for the gouge.

Now most people take the picture and either send it by MMS to friends n family or just show it on the phone to people later. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/15/pictures-camera-phones-picture-editing-and-that-internet/">&raquo;</a></p>
