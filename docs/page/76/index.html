        <p>Just wasted 2 hours of my life watching "Closer". What a steaming turd of a movie. Why do they make films about people who you just want to die within 10 minutes of the opening scene? Not a great weekend of movies. &ldquo;Meet the Fockers&rdquo; was desperately disappointing - how lazy were they to blow the opportunity of having Hoffman and Streisand on the screen together?

        <p>Another reason to like JWZ - he is a Bill Hicks fan too [by the looks of things](http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/486553.html). The good always die young. Saw him live once when he played Dublin about a year before he died. He was on his anti-smoking kick at that stage (too late obviously) which to be honest wasn&rsquo;t half as funny as his pro-smoking rants. &ldquo;Non-Smokers die&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;every day&rdquo;.

        <p>Oisin O'Neill (3) of Old Chapel Bandon, registered his utter disgust this past Sunday over the non-appearence of elephants at the 2005 Bandon Summer Agricultural show. Proceedings have been served on Conor O'Neill (37), also of Old Chapel Bandon, for mis-leading advertising regarding the nature of the beasts which would appear at the show. Disappontment was also expressed over the lack of tigers. On a positive note, none of the attending O&rsquo;Neill family had ever seen bulls that large despite the elder family members having seen calves born in the farm across the road in Ratoath in 1972 at the age of 4. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/05/24/elephant-no-show-shocker-at-bandon-show/">&raquo;</a></p>
