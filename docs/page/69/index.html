The Servisair genius at check-in put us in three separate rows. She was either as thick as two short planks or bitter over her fabulous career.

        <p>Run off my feet this week so blogging has been even lighter than usual. Two health related stories caught my eye:
Discoverers of H.Pylori get Nobel Prize
This is fantastic. I&rsquo;ve had the treatment and unfortunately it appears I am in the 10% for whom the little bastard bacteria are not the problem. My problem is more likely to be Curry, Coffee and Sauvignon Blanc.
The discovery that Helicobacter Pylori is responsible for the majority of stomach ulcers is often used by the alternative medicine brigade to beat up &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; medicine. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/06/quick-health-round-up/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Maria, our summer student, finished up on Friday. We bounced around a few ideas for nosh and settled on something we figured everyone would like - Scoozi&rsquo;s on Winthrop Ave just near the GPO in Cork.
Great buzz in the place on arrival and no delay getting seated (well it was 5.30 on a Friday). A bit disappointed that there was no beer on the menu - I had imagined big jugs of the stuff in the middle of the table. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/09/26/scoozis-good-for-a-friday-night-bash/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The parents are in Spain and my mother gave me a shout to see if I wanted anything whilst she was there. The last time she got me a fab selection of Chorizo and Salami which I am still working through. So I just asked for the same again. But I also asked her if she would keep her eye out for Smoked Paprika - the main flavour in Chorizo. Fiona failed to find it on her last trip and I&rsquo;m beginning to think that someone will have to find a spice emporium over there. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/09/26/mmm-spicy/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>&nbsp; Update 19/09/2005: I had left out a few steps on this originally, so I'm re-publishing. I have a recipe for Meatballs with Tomato Sauce which is based mainly on Sophie Grigson's recipe in her Meat Course Book. That is one of the best Cookbooks of the past few years but sadly is out of print now. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage Meat Book is a pretty good alternative for carnivores. My family rave about this meal when I cook it and I have to admit to being partial to it myself. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/09/19/meatballs-in-tomato-sauce/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The BBC has an article on the most recent study of Homeopathy showing, yet again, that it is no better than placebo.
Whilst I consider most alternative therapies to be rubbish being pushed by idiots and charlatans, Homeopathy has managed to inhabit that grey zone where one doesn&rsquo;t want to completely dismiss it. This was down to a few factors - the fact that it has been around for a long time, the fact that they do seem to get some form of results and finally the desire of those who have followed a formal course of study to be officially recognised and to not allow actual charlatans to calls themselves homeopaths. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/09/18/quack-quack-quack-homeopathy-doesnt-work-shocker/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My bottle of Stormhoek Sauvignon Blanc 2005 from the gapingvoid freebie arrived by courier this evening. I was going to wait until tomorrow to review but one dead linux server has fast-tracked the opening.

It uses a screw-cap which I support 100% for Sauvignons. I am sick to the back teeth of getting ruined bottles of Sancerre and Pouilly Fumé with their crappy corks.
On opening, a bit of a sniff tells me that it is along the same lines as other South African Sauvignons and not like the Marlborough ones. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/09/13/stormhoek-not-quite-stonking-but-pretty-damned-good/">&raquo;</a></p>
