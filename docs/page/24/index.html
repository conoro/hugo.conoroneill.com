        <p>Looks like the Science Week guys are hardcore! They&rsquo;ve hired Edelman to help with PR. I like the idea they came up with. Basically Irish Bloggers have to answer some stuff about their favourite inventions as blog posts during the coming week and we might win a Wii.
Today&rsquo;s question is &ldquo;What was the favourite invention from your childhood&rdquo;.
This is an easy one. The home computer, specifically the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/13/more-science-week-stuff/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t normally mention posts that I write on blognation over here but I think this one is probably of great interest to many of my local readers and those in more rural locations in Ireland and the UK.
A company called 3G Doctor in Kerry provides a service whereby you can get a video consultantion with a qualified doctor using your 3G phone.
I&rsquo;ve written all about it here. I&rsquo;d be interested to hear what you think and whether the 3G coverage is good enough yet so that it is useful to the people who need it most. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/07/3g-doctor-signals-the-return-of-house-visits/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There is a wonderful bunch of things planned in Cork as part of Science Week which will hopefully increase the interest in science amongst kids. The target audience is 10-16 year olds but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll drag our 8 year old along to some of it.
It is on from 11th Nov to 18th Nov in various locations around the city. I believe the HQ is City Hall and local tech companies will have stands there. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/10/27/science-week-in-november/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>[Locanda Locatelli](http://www.locandalocatelli.com),8 Seymour Street, London, W1H 7JZ, UK _Good Italian food ruined by some of the worst service I've had in a restaurant in years. These people need to learn some manners and learn how to smile._ ![](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/2outof5.gif) This was our final dinner in London and I had very high hopes. I've been a fan of Giorgio Locatelli since the wonderful Tony and Giorgio TV series in 2002\. He came across as a great cook with a sparkling sense of humour. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/10/21/review-of-locanda-locatelli/">&raquo;</a></p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>A friend of a friend is visiting Cork soon and is wondering if any restaurants can assure him that their dishes are nut-free? This person feels that many would use vegetable oil with nut traces when cooking.
It&rsquo;s a tough one I know but any tips would be appreciated. If you run a restaurant and are willing to make the assertion, even on a sub-set of your dishes, feel free to comment here. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/10/15/any-certified-nut-allergy-friendly-restaurants-in-cork-city/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>[The Nasty Bits by Anthony Bourdain](http://www.anthonybourdain.com/)  _A fine collection of articles he has written over the past few years on all things food and restaurant related. A great food writer._ ![](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/5outof5.gif) This book has been on my ever growing pile of unread books for a long time. I finally took it on a flight to San Fran so I could make a dent in it. The format is perfect for picking up intermittently since each piece is from a magazine or other publication. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/10/06/review-of-the-nasty-bits-by-anthony-bourdain/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The updated Irish Politics site is now live. This is a tremendous resource for anyone interested in what people on the ground are writing about politics here.
It is a site that watches for any blog posts that mention a TD&rsquo;s name and provides a summary of that post on the site. It is party neutral and is in no way partisan.
Those with blogs can add a widget which displays the latest politics posts on their own blog sidebar. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/09/15/politics-in-ireland-site-re-vamp/">&raquo;</a></p>
