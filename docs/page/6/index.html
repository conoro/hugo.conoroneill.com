        <p>As you may have read in my previous post, I&rsquo;ve been dipping my toe into running off-road. The phrase &ldquo;trail running&rdquo; still seems pretty rare in Ireland where I see &ldquo;mountain running&rdquo; mentioned more often, and &ldquo;fell running&rdquo; in the UK.
Last week my wife spotted on the Running in Cork blog that there was a trail run on in Castlefreke/Rathbarry on Sunday 18th called Run Forest Run. It instantly got me interested as it was [a] nearby and [b] only 5 miles long. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/09/19/run-forest-run-trail-race-report/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Shortly after we moved to Bandon, over 10 years ago, I bought a bunch of Ordnance Survey maps of the area and two books by Damien Enright called &ldquo;Walks of Courtmacsherry Bay &amp; The Seven Heads&rdquo; and &ldquo;Walks in and around Kinsale&rdquo;. We had high hopes of being outdoorsy. To our shame, the most we ever did was to haul the kids along the short track in Kilbrittain woods, the even shorter one in Ballinspittle woods and the tiny bit longer one in Dromillihy woods. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/08/26/the-seven-heads-walk-and-lusitania-trail-is-one-of-west-corks-best-kept-secrets/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Most people in this country seem happy enough to have it run by imbeciles and criminals, so it’s a relief that some people actually care.
The official web-site which holds the records of the Oireachtas is the kind of incompetent mess that can only have been designed to be that way on purpose.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been running slowly since 2009. This year has seen two and a half marathons so far, with the Clon Half probably ending the year nicely. But since the very first run I&rsquo;ve struggled with audio. I think most people listen to music and I&rsquo;ve done that a bit but I&rsquo;ve spent far more time listening to Podcasts. I listened to Kermode and Mayo on my first Half Marathon in Dingle in 2010 and I listened to them again a few weeks ago in Dingle in the 2015 Half. <a class="read-more" href="/2015/10/04/i-ve-finally-found-a-running-audio-setup-that-works/">&raquo;</a></p>

But, like many people, I&rsquo;ve had it with WordPress. Pretty much every WP blog I either ran or had some dealings with, has been hacked. Whether through security-hole-riddled plugins, xmlrpc.php or other bugs in WP. <a class="read-more" href="/2015/03/05/hello-world/">&raquo;</a></p>

I use a lot of hot sauce but tend to be very boring in the ones I buy, mainly sticking to the supermarket reliables like Tabasco and Encona. I&rsquo;ve got the odd Irish one too but many of them seem obsessed with heat and not flavour (Rebel Chilli being the worst culprit here). <a class="read-more" href="/2014/01/01/two-lovely-hot-sauces-from-mexico/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For a good few years, this blog was all about food. I had lots of restaurant reviews and foodie pics and experiments like making sausages. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, I haven&rsquo;t done much in that area for a long time. Whilst I&rsquo;ve eaten lots of lovely food since then, I haven&rsquo;t had much that was truly memorable. Until Friday night.
My parents were down for a visit and we planned to go to The Poacher&rsquo;s Inn with them and big sis, but when we went to book we were told the Tapas night was starting at 8pm and it was only a very limited menu before that. <a class="read-more" href="/2013/03/03/poachers-inn-tapas-night-staggeringly-good-epic-in-fact/">&raquo;</a></p>
