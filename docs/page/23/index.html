He wants you to use what you know about iKi beer and Caf√© Mao and tell them which dish on the menu would make the best match for iKi, and why. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/27/fancy-a-meal-for-two/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Many of the readers of this blog are surely also fans of The Humble Housewife, Deborah Hadley. She has just launched a fabulous new web-site called Spicendipity selling homemade sauces and 100% natural spice mixes and baking mixes.
Debz had me won over just by saying &ldquo;BBQ sauce&rdquo; when she first revealed what she was putting together. We love the idea so much, the prize we are giving away on LouderVoice for the best review at Taste of Cork is one of her BBQ Hampers. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/23/spicendipity-goes-live/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I did a last-minute race down to The Fish Shop in Union Hall this morning to check it out. It&rsquo;s as good as they say! Great selection of fish, shellfish, gourmet seafood products and wine. Well worth travelling to.
So my lazy ass didn&rsquo;t get up early enough and I left Bandon at 12 knowing they shut at 1pm on a Saturday. I made it to Union Hall by 12:45 after spending the journey as far as Rosscarbery behind someone who averaged 35 MPH. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/21/yes-the-fish-is-fantastic/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>So if food lovers are foodies and wine lovers are winos ;-) I&rsquo;ve decided that fish lovers are fishies. Just got a comment on an old blog post about the fish shop in Union Hall and it&rsquo;s all good news:
 we Glenmar Shellfish have now merged with Antcar over 12mths ago - if you are ever in Union Hall again be sure and call into the shop again - The Fish Shop - you will not be disappointed - we have recently extended the shop and added alot of additional products to our impressive array of fish - including mussels ! <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/19/great-news-for-fishies-in-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It looks like Taste of Dublin this weekend was a big success and a huge improvement over last year. I was thrilled to hear that they are doing a Taste of Cork from Friday 27th June to Sunday 29th. Over on LouderVoice, we&rsquo;d like to capture the quality of the event by having people review what they eat/drink/encounter by SMS. The most popular review will win a prize (suggestions on what that should be are very welcome). <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/15/you-going-to-taste-of-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Christine and Dermot Gannon have created a flawless hideaway experience in the Tipperary countryside. Our short one night stay turned out to be one of my most enjoyable travel experiences ever.
My lovely mother-in-law Mary got myself and Catherine a night away in The Old Convent as a present last Christmas. It came very highly recommended by her sister-in-law Marie whose standards are very high. We headed off from Bandon mid-afternoon on a Friday and arrived little more than an hour later in Clogheen. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/10/a-perfect-hideaway/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I think I&rsquo;ve pretty much seen every TV programme that Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has made. The quality/interest has varied over the years but I&rsquo;m really digging (pun intended) this new series.
The show has the same premise as things like Jamie at Home where the focus is on growing and cooking seasonally. Obviously this is all about Spring and early summer and the first episode focused on lettuce, spinach etc.
You won&rsquo;t see a huge number of recipes but you will see different approaches to vegetables and produce so that they go centre stage. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/05/hugh-does-it-again/">&raquo;</a></p>
