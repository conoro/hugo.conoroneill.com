        <p>An unsatisfying mix of excellent food and wine with haphazard service and crazy pricing. The most expensive meal we&rsquo;re ever had but sadly not the best.
Regular readers of the blog know that I was blown away by the documentary on Dylan McGrath getting his Michelin star for Mint. When my parents gave me a 40th birthday present of a meal for two there, I was gobsmacked and couldn&rsquo;t wait to go. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/05/24/mint-didnt-leave-me-feeling-refreshed/">&raquo;</a></p>

Most of your old faves are there, I&rsquo;ve just been playing the ever-brilliant Jet Set Willy. I love just clicking around and being reminded of many happy hours as a teenager in the 80&rsquo;s. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/04/27/retro-fans-rejoice/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again where men in tight leather pants race up and down the Clon road at Old Chapel on bright yellow motorbikes :-)
We&rsquo;ve gone down for a look a couple of times over the years and it is genuinely a very exciting event. Noise, burning rubber, unburnt fuel and fabulous bikes. My kids think it&rsquo;s fantastic and hopefully the baby won&rsquo;t screech this time.
Now if only the rain would hold off so we don&rsquo;t have any accidents. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/04/20/motorbike-racing-today/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I love finding something great almost on your doorstep that you&rsquo;ve ignored for years. We finally took a trip to the Model Railway village last weekend and it was a resounding success. Kids, young and old will have some fun here.
I&rsquo;ve lost track of the number of times I&rsquo;ve said we must pop in for a look. The closest we got was some of the kids taking the road-train around Clon with their Granny last year. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/04/13/review-of-clonakilty-model-railway-village/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The bandon.ie blog has an important post about the Action Plan for the improvement of Bandon town centre. They have full details on what it&rsquo;s all about but the critical bit is having your say. Let the consultants who are drawing up the proposals know what you think should be done to improve the town. Some off the top of my head are:
 Finish the bypass (I know I know, this isn&rsquo;t in their remit) Improved street lighting, particularly on bypass Extended footpaths on all major routes out of town Changing junction priorities Traffic lights at top of Glasslyn Removal of some right turns in the town Better bus stops Encouraging the owners of all the land on Glasslyn to develop it Encouraging a new commercial indoor play area Presenting Bandon as a great location for hi-tech biz. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/04/01/an-important-one-for-bandon-residents/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We&rsquo;re just playing around with a few ideas on a site called Jaiku this morning (they were bought by Google a few months back). The idea is that you can have discussion channels on particular topics like technology, politics, Bandon GAA, whatever. What makes it (and other great sites like Twitter) so powerful is that you can interact with it entirely through SMS on your phone.
So this morning I created two non-techie ones that I thought might appeal to my more foodie readers. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/29/recipe-and-gardening-advice-by-sms-and-web/">&raquo;</a></p>
