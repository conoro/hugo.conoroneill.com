        <p>The Poacher&rsquo;s Inn is the nearest eatery/pub to our house. In a previous incarnation as Ted Amber&rsquo;s it was an ok pub and a pretty poor restaurant that was barely above the level of a carvery.
The place was bought maybe 18 months ago (or even longer?) and reports have been steadily good. I had a pub lunch there recently and was very impressed so we decided to try the full restaurant last night. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/19/review-of-the-poachers-inn/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This is less of a review and more of a vote of support. Last week Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall kicked off a campaign to get people eating Free Range Chicken. He did this through a series of compelling programmes comparing intensively raised chicken production with Free Range.
Because no-one would let him film in a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; chicken production unit, he was forced to build his own. He split it down the middle with half as free range and half as intensive. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/13/review-of-hughs-chicken-run/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We all know to expect snooty service in Paris but I&rsquo;ve rarely found that and have enjoyed most meals that I&rsquo;ve had there. So I was a bit gobsmacked by the Jean Marie Le Pen supporters running Buddha Bar in Paris.
The &ldquo;evening&rdquo; unfolded like this.
 We&rsquo;re at Le Web 3 conference in Paris and we want to get some food. We also want to do so near the NetVibes party later on Rue de Rivoli Tariq Krim says that it isn&rsquo;t a good area for food but Buddha Bar is ok. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/06/review-of-buddha-bar-paris/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Michael Newham just left a comment on my post about car-sharing. It looks like this is going to happen next year. It&rsquo;s a great idea.
 Our company ‘Mendes - GoCar’ will be providing the car-sharing service in Cork City Centre. We hope to have it operational by May the 1st 2008.
Please see the Wikipedia article for a good overview of what Car-Sharing is about.
All our ‘GoCars’ will have dedicated parking spaces ‘GoBases’ near high residential and business nodes of population. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/12/13/car-sharing-coming-to-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>
