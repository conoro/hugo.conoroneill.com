        <p>I know there are tons of small businesses out there struggling with IT, even basics like anti-virus and e-mail. Unfortunately, lack of knowledge can often mean you aren&rsquo;t even aware that there are better and cheaper ways of doing what you are doing.
Last Autumn, the County Enterprise Boards launched Tech-Check to address this widespread problem. It&rsquo;s a simple but highly effective initiative to help businesses sort out their most pressing technology problems. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/19/have-a-small-business-and-need-it-help/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I meant to write this post a few months back and was finally reminded to yesterday when I was in Cork Airport yet again.
The old airport carparks had the most unreliable equipment on the planet, pure third world garbage. I spent more time stuck in queues trying to get out of there due to malfunctioning barriers than any other airport, including Dublin which I have used more.
So you&rsquo;d think, when spending â‚¬180m on a new airport (and hoping we taxpayers will stump up the money for it), that they&rsquo;d find a supplier of equipment that, ye know, actually works. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/12/cork-airport-incompetence/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As someone who grew up in Kilkenny from the age of 6-18, I was very excited to see that Creative Camp is on this weekend. Not only that, but it&rsquo;s on in the wonderful Kilkenny Castle where I spent many a day trying to find secret tunnels as a kid.
If you are wondering what it is all about, the idea is that the attendees are the presenters. It is in the BarCamp tradition of &ldquo;unconferences&rdquo; where the agenda for the day is very much made up on the day. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/06/creative-camp-comes-to-kilkenny/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Mike Newham has updated us on Car Sharing in Cork:
 We&rsquo;re pushing out the introduction in Cork till July the 4th because of the massive VRT changes that occur on that date. We&rsquo;ll start off with eight cars on the road - 3 Ford Focuses (Foci?), 4 Ford Fiestas and 1 Transit Connect for delivery&rsquo;s and the like.
All will be low emission diesels with extra safety options and lots of helpful gizmos like bluetooth and sat-nav. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/03/05/more-on-cork-car-sharing/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>John Prendergast from Aonach just let me know about a competition a friend of his is running. It&rsquo;s pretty damned impressive: Glengarriff Lodge near Bantry in West Cork is giving away a Luxury Self Catering  weekend worth â‚¬1175 to one lucky blogger who mentions it! The location looks gorgeous and the Lodge is interesting because the aim was to be both luxurious and eco-friendly/sustainable.
The concept might be of interest to Irish Bloggers who have a deep interest in sustainability like Tom Atkins or Rebecca Hillman. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/02/16/ooh-very-cool-competition/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This is an unusual book made up of a collection of 18 discourses on individual ingredients which were originally distributed as a newsletter. It was first published in 1992 and I was given this 2004 edition by my sister.

Initial impressions of the book are extremely positive; the writing is of very high quality and the opening treatise on salt catches the imagination. From then on however it seems to alternate between wonderfully interesting chapters and workmanlike almost Wikipedia-style dry listing of facts about certain foods. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/02/14/review-of-the-artful-eater/">&raquo;</a></p>
