        <p>This newish place is in the Midway FoodCourt, Portlaoise and is nearly successful in its attempt to do something a bit different.
I had to drive up to Dublin recently (having become over-used to the train) and stopped at Midway on the N7/N8 interchange to grab something to eat. I had spotted a newish place in there the last time I&rsquo;d stopped for coffee and I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/12/09/tapenade-bistro-on-n7n8/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>How many people are going to plump for the jesusphone in their posts? If Steve Jobs is responsible,it must be magic. Except it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s a very nice UI on a phone design that was out of date in 2006 in Europe. So if not a fashion accessory then what? I think the Science Week people really mean &ldquo;new product&rdquo; when they say &ldquo;invention&rdquo;, otherwise I&rsquo;m going to have to go a read some science journals to find the latest cure for cancer. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/17/final-science-week-post-best-invention-of-2007/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We went on our summer holidays to Barley Cove for 11 years in a row as kids. On several of those years we went to Garnish Island via Glengarrif. That was as far as I ever got on the Beara peninsula until last week when I visited Adrigole. I honestly can&rsquo;t put into words how beautiful it is down there. If I was American I&rsquo;d call it God&rsquo;s country. Perfect views on a perfect day made me want to immediately retire and move there. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/16/cork-sailing-blog/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Today&rsquo;s Science Week Question is an easy one &ldquo;Which invention has helped you most with your working life?&rdquo;. Of course it is the internet. The highlights of my history with it are as follows:
 1990: Learned it existed when I started Masters in UCD 1991: Figured out email, Usenet news, Gopher. Discovered ftp.funet.fi and the world of shareware 1992: First job in S3. Email only. Figured out ftpmail to download programs overnight on 14. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/16/science-week-invention-which-helps-work/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Today&rsquo;s Science Week Question is &ldquo;What’s the next gadget that you want to buy?&ldquo;
The next gadget I buy hasn&rsquo;t been created yet. It&rsquo;ll be when Nokia take the N95 and the N810 and merge them into one product.
This:

plus this:

It will have:
 Quad Band Phone 5MP Camera with xenon flash HSDPA 3G Data Wifi Bluetooth Stereo Bluetooth Audio GPS Touch Screen Slide Out Keyboard Run a variant of Linux TV Out Accelerometer Massive Battery Take massive memory cards Offer full PDA functionality and sync with both desktop apps like Outlook and online apps like Goog Calendar A music player designed for podcasts (remember last spot, bookmark, speedy seek within track) VOIP SIP the same dimensions as the N810 A price tag of less than €400  I don&rsquo;t ask for much really, do I? <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/15/science-week-next-gadget-purchase/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Today&rsquo;s Science Week question is &ldquo;What invention do you want to see most in the future&rdquo;. This is an easy one to describe but it&rsquo;ll be a long time coming. I want to see an inexpensive non-invasive home medical diagnostic machine that can detect and diagnose a wide range of problems on its own and via a data-feed to the relevant medical experts.
The benefits of such a machine could be enormous <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/14/science-week-invention-of-the-future/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Looks like the Science Week guys are hardcore! They&rsquo;ve hired Edelman to help with PR. I like the idea they came up with. Basically Irish Bloggers have to answer some stuff about their favourite inventions as blog posts during the coming week and we might win a Wii.
Today&rsquo;s question is &ldquo;What was the favourite invention from your childhood&rdquo;.
This is an easy one. The home computer, specifically the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/13/more-science-week-stuff/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t normally mention posts that I write on blognation over here but I think this one is probably of great interest to many of my local readers and those in more rural locations in Ireland and the UK.
A company called 3G Doctor in Kerry provides a service whereby you can get a video consultantion with a qualified doctor using your 3G phone.
I&rsquo;ve written all about it here. I&rsquo;d be interested to hear what you think and whether the 3G coverage is good enough yet so that it is useful to the people who need it most. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/11/07/3g-doctor-signals-the-return-of-house-visits/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There is a wonderful bunch of things planned in Cork as part of Science Week which will hopefully increase the interest in science amongst kids. The target audience is 10-16 year olds but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll drag our 8 year old along to some of it.
It is on from 11th Nov to 18th Nov in various locations around the city. I believe the HQ is City Hall and local tech companies will have stands there. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/10/27/science-week-in-november/">&raquo;</a></p>
