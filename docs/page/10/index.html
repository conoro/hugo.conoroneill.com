        <p>Yesterday I did my first ever [Half Marathon in Dingle](http://dinglemarathon.ie/). Yes it nearly killed me and I had to walk lots of it but I finished and I had several hundred people behind me. Compared to some of my friends who regularly do Triathlons, my achievement is nothing special. But for someone who spent 20 years sedentary and started running in January, aged 41, with a gippy ankle and hugely overweight, I'm pretty proud of myself. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/09/05/google-health-android-cardiotrainer-has-me-excited/">&raquo;</a></p>

Whilst it is a fantastic collection of recipes and information that all Irish cooks should own, I fear that along with Darina&rsquo;s Forgotten Skills of Cooking, we are looking at our past.

        <p>Brilliant job by Andrew Kingston of Arkutech.ie in building the newbandon.ie site.

A quick poke around confirmed that it is built on the same fantastic Wordpress foundation as this fine blog.
A certain person named Donncha O&rsquo;Caoimh is one of the main developers of Wordpress and just lives a few miles away in Blarney. Bandon is clearly commited to buying local.
