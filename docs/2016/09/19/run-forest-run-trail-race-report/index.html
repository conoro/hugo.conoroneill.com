    <section class="post-content">
      <p>As you may have read in my previous post, I&rsquo;ve been dipping my toe into running off-road. The phrase &ldquo;trail running&rdquo; still seems pretty rare in Ireland where I see &ldquo;mountain running&rdquo; mentioned more often, and &ldquo;fell running&rdquo; in the UK.</p>

<p>Last week my wife spotted on the <a href="https://corkrunning.blogspot.ie/">Running in Cork blog</a> that there was a trail run on in Castlefreke/Rathbarry on Sunday 18th called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Run-Forest-Run-175750705775650/?fref=ts">Run Forest Run</a>. It instantly got me interested as it was [a] nearby and [b] only 5 miles long. I have just spent 11 days sick on and off after a trip to Vietnam. Top tip - don&rsquo;t brush your teeth with the tap-water, even in a high-end hotel. I&rsquo;m doing the Berlin Marathon next Sunday, so the big question I wanted to answer yesterday was &ldquo;am I well enough for Berlin yet?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For the laugh I asked my 14yo and the 17yo sons if they wanted to do it with me. I was shocked when they both said yes. Their mother then added the sweetener of €20 for the winner between the three of us. Neither of them have done much more than a bit of running in school, so I was very impressed by their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>You can see the Strava route and Ordnance Survey map below. A lovely mix of path, trail, road, forest and beach in a beautiful part of West Cork.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/run_forest_run_route.jpg" alt="Route1" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/14224702_1430913196926055_7696748586087695054_n.jpg" alt="Route2" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Sunday morning welcomed us with lashing rain. But what the hell, in for a penny, in for €20. The start/finish was the <a href="http://www.galleyflash.com/">Galleyflash Rowing Club</a> on Kilkern lake. A few people were there when we arrived and sadly the numbers didn&rsquo;t really grow. In the end, they dropped the 5km and only 19 of us lined out for the 5 miler. I figure there were three reasons for turnout: [1] the rotten weather [2] the Charleville Half Marathon with nearly 1000 people was on the same day and [3] the lack of much publicity for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_113913.jpg" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p>But we didn&rsquo;t mind in the slightest.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_115939.jpg" alt="Start" /></p>

<p>Off we went and we quickly ended up at the back of the field. But the two boys looked solid and we were doing a decent pace for n00bs. They slowed down a bit going into Castlefreke Woods and then grinded to a slow walk going up the first hill in the woods.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_121814.jpg" alt="Woods" /></p>

<p>We picked the pace back-up and did the road stretch quickly. Then on to the nasty-assed hill up to the large cross.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_124653.jpg" alt="Hill" /></p>

<p>The boys were struggling with tiredness and calf pain and they claimed to have found god at this point ;-)</p>

<p>The downhill was brilliant fun and we ran the whole thing. Here&rsquo;s a video which gives some sense of the fantastic location and views. Apologies for the relentless heavy breathing.</p>

<p>The final mile on the beach was brilliantly horrific with huge patches of soft sand you couldn&rsquo;t avoid. Then back on to the road for a bit and to the Rowing club. The 14yo came in first of us, having found a great second wind. The 17yo hurt his achilles on the beach and came in last. But I was incredibly proud of them both. 8.4km is no joke off-road in the lashing rain when you have done no training for it.</p>

<p>Tea and biccies sorted us out before we drove home.</p>

<p>I really want to thank the organisers and helpers for a superb event. Everything was absolutely top notch from the signage to the stewards. I&rsquo;d particularly call out the young guy at the end of the beach who had to stand there watching 3 slowly moving bodies in the rain for an interminable duration so he could tell us where to go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be making lots of noise about this event next year to try and drive up the numbers. Honestly, even if you&rsquo;ve never run before, you&rsquo;ll love this route and the terrain.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.imra.ie/events/details/id/1339/">IMRA also did an event here</a> in February. I&rsquo;m aiming to do that if it&rsquo;s on next year.</p>

<p>If you know of any other trail events like this in West Cork, do let me know!</p>

<p>Oh and yes, I think I&rsquo;ll be fine for Berlin.</p>

<p>Update 1: There is now a <a href="http://corkrunning.blogspot.ie/2016/09/results-photos-of-run-forest-run-5m-in.html">Running in Cork post</a> about it and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Run-Forest-Run-175750705775650/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1445859345431440">gallery of pics on Facebook</a>.</p>
