      <description>DNF? For non-runners reading this, DNF means Did Not Finish. In my preview post I ended with &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how I do. Particularly when the rain comes in at night.&amp;rdquo;
On the plus side, the rain came in during daylight hours. But I&amp;rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the start.
Nope, nope, let&amp;rsquo;s thank some people first.
Thank Yous   Elieen - The woman, the legend. Words like &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; have become overused and devalued.</description>

      <description>The Kerry Way Whilst millions of people have completed marathons over the past few decades, ultramarathons are still pretty niche. Ireland has a bunch of fantastic ultrarunners and a handful of amazing ultramarathons.
The big kahuna of them all is the Kerry Way Ultra, which is about to have its tenth outing on September 2nd and 3rd. The Kerry Way is a wonderful trail that traverses the entire Iveragh peninsula. Many people travel from the US and mainland Europe to do multi-day hikes of the route.</description>
