      <description>I have a series of long-overdue customer support horror stories to write about, but this one really has me enraged.
TL;DR I ordered something from Pineberry Pi in Poland. It shipped to Ireland. Fedex insists I need to pay import duties. Pineberry Pi is acting like it&amp;rsquo;s not their problem. Avoid doing business with all these people.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been shopping online since 1997. I&amp;rsquo;ve been shopping from EU sites using the Euro since 2002ish.</description>
