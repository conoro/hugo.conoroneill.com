        <small>This is as good as any store-bought brown soda bread. Not as good as my mother&#39;s tho.</small>

<p>In January 2020, I went 99.9% plant-based as a way of kick-starting serious weight loss after 20 years of being either overweight or obese. The only initial exception was cow milk in my tea. I did similar back in 2016 but that was my silly &ldquo;6 Day Vegan&rdquo; plan where I ate chicken curry on a Friday. Both times I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://uk.veganuary.com/">Veganuary</a> as the starting point.</p>
<p>After two months at 99.9%, I took the leap and dropped all dairy too. So now, apart from the very rare finger dip in a brownie or other lockdown treats that the kids make, I&rsquo;m effectively 100% plant-based. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;ll do it forever but I&rsquo;m honestly finding it very easy and almost never miss meat or dairy. I play a lot with meat substitutes but that&rsquo;s more to do with texture and familiarity than wanting it to necessarily taste like meat. My <a href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/products/the-beyond-burger/">Beyond Meat</a> burger stack is a thing of beauty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do more posts on the subject soon but suffice to say that it&rsquo;s 10x easier to go vegan in 2020 than in 2016. There&rsquo;s a massive new range of vegan and vegetarian options even in rural Irish SuperValu supermarkets. Huge kudos to Ireland&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.denny.ie/food/meat-free-range/">Denny</a> on their sausages, burgers and mince. All are superb. Birdseye are also doing a good range of <a href="https://www.birdseye.co.uk/range/meat-free-mealtimes/green-cuisine">&ldquo;Green Cuisine&rdquo;</a> but they do need to do some work on texture/taste. <a href="http://schullandcrossbones.ie/">Non-dairy yoghurts</a> are pretty much indistinguishable from dairy. And <a href="https://violifefoods.com/">Violife</a> are doing some very good cheese alternatives. Their feta in particular is fantastic. They just need more tang and crumbliness in all of their products. Our goto milks are <a href="https://www.oatly.com/int/products/oat-drink-barista-edition">Oatly Barista Edition</a> and <a href="https://minorfigures.com/">Minor Figures</a> oat milks. And there is always a range of <a href="https://www.quorn.ie/products/roast-style-sliced-fillets">Quorn</a> products in the fridge and freezer for those quick protein needs.</p>
<p>Now here we are near the end of June and I&rsquo;ve lost 38lbs/17kg so far this year with no let-up in sight. Of course being mostly off booze has helped a lot too, but previous booze-free attempts have never had this impact. My cholesterol, blood pressure and BMI (obvs) have also all plummeted.</p>
<p>Sorry, you were looking for a bread recipe?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes I&rsquo;ve also been doing the sourdough thing. My starter is now very strong and I do one big loaf a week using the &ldquo;no-knead dutch oven&rdquo; method based on info from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWbl3Sr2y1Y">J. Kenji Lopez-Alt</a> and <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/no-knead-sourdough-bread-recipe">King Arthur Flour</a> in the US. But that&rsquo;s not what this post is about.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s brown bread is legendary and is sent to fans far and wide. But it is a traditional one involving buttermilk and eggs. I knew I had zero hope of replicating its perfection in vegan-form as no one has been able to, even following her original recipe to the letter. There&rsquo;s magic in those Ratoath fingers.</p>
<p>So I took a range of recipes online and started playing with them. This version has been working well for me for months now, even if I&rsquo;m finding the initial wetness seems very variable, so I can&rsquo;t give a definitive cooking time.</p>
<p>Start by pre-heating your oven to 200C (fan) and oiling a standard silicone or metal bread loaf tin.</p>
<p>Mix together the following dry ingredients very well first:</p>
<ul>
<li>150g plain white flour</li>
<li>200g wholemeal flour</li>
<li>A &ldquo;shake&rdquo; of each of the following to get your total weight to approx 450-550g:
<ul>
<li>Wheatgerm</li>
<li>Wheatbran</li>
<li>Milled flaxseed</li>
<li>Chia seed (milled or whole)</li>
<li>Pinhead oatmeal</li>
<li>Poppy seeds</li>
<li>Hemp seeds</li>
<li>Pumpkin seeds</li>
<li>Any other tasty seeds or oatmeal etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tsp baking soda / bread soda / bicarbonate of soda (not baking powder)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix the following in a jug but don&rsquo;t leave it too long or it&rsquo;ll split:</p>
<ul>
<li>300ml of oatmilk or other plant-based milk</li>
<li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the liquid to the dry mix along with an optional squirt of maple syrup or other sweetness. I&rsquo;ve become partial to black treacle or blackstrap molasses.</p>
<p>Mix well with a spatula. It should be pretty loose, not a tight ball, and flow easily into the loaf tin. You may need to tweak milk amounts depending on the flours and type of milk you use.</p>
<p>Sprinkle sesame seeds or pumpkin seeds all over the top and pat it into the mix with the spatula.</p>
<p>Cut a deep line along the length in the middle of the mix with a knife.</p>
<p>Pop it into the oven for between 40 mins and 55 mins. I&rsquo;m finding 50 mins is currently optimal in our oven. Check at 40 to ensure it&rsquo;s not burning and to check the brownness. I use a K-type thermocouple to try and get a relatively accurate temperature in the oven but it varies hugely.</p>
<p>Maybe rotate once during the cooking time if you have an inconsistent oven like ours.</p>
<p>Pop out of the tin onto a cooling rack for 30 mins or so.</p>
<p>Eat.</p>
<p>If you find it&rsquo;s a bit damp in the middle, just increase the cook time on the next attempt.</p>
