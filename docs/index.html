            As I have only done 30km in the La Sportiva Prodigio Max so far, you can take this review with a grain of salt. You can read my full review of the La Sportiva Prodigio Pro here, which I absolutely loved. So when the Max was announced I immediately pounced. I was imagining something like the Pro but for massive distances. Possible a wider base and toe-box with a more cushioned relaxed ride.

I&rsquo;ve spent the past few years mostly running in the Hoka Speedgoat and the Brooks Caldera. If you&rsquo;ve read my other reviews you&rsquo;ll know that I also like the NNormal Tomir 2.0 and the Saucony Endorphin Rift. OTOH, I rate the Salomon Vision as the worst trail shoe in decades.

            My inability to finish any race in the past two years has been weighing heavily on my mind for quite a while. Between DNFs, Cut-Offs and injuries, I was starting to doubt my ability to finish any race at all. Admittedly everything has been ultra-length in that time so maybe it was just a case that I&rsquo;m not really cut out for the long stuff.
As we planned our summer vacation, we had our usual challenge of finding somewhere that I could run trails and somewhere my wife could swim.

I must also use ChatGPT o3 to build a simple posting tool for the Hugo system this blog runs on, that doesn&rsquo;t require me to change how I do everything.

            As you can read in my review of the truly awful Salomon Vision shoes, my hopes of running the Kerry Way Ultra in 2024 were ruined last weekend. I had an x-ray on Monday to confirm that it wasn&rsquo;t a break.
I then went to my physio/PT on Tuesday. He confirmed multile ligament tears. He was pretty blunt that I&rsquo;d be nuts to try KWU. Despite all the icing, compression and elevation that I had done since Saturday, I still had very restricted motion and some pain.

            This won&rsquo;t be a long review. How could it be when I&rsquo;ve only done 1 km in the Salomon Vision. It&rsquo;s more of a rant.
I buy maybe 6-7 pairs of running shoes a year. Usually equally split between road and trail. For many years the trail ones were Altra, Hoka, Inov-8 and Brooks. I wanted to try Salomon but every review made it sound like I&rsquo;d have to remove two toes to fit into them.

            I can&rsquo;t imagine there&rsquo;s a trail runner alive who hasn&rsquo;t heard of Kilian Jornet. He&rsquo;s the goat when it comes to mountains. 6 years ago my kids brilliantly reached out to him and John Kelly to see if they could get an autograph or something to mark my 50th birthday. Kilian sent a very cool signed card and John, the legend, sent me a video, which I&rsquo;ll never forget.
So the whole NNormal thing obviously caught my attention.

Having said that, I see 2021 and early 2022 as the pinnacle of my running, to-date. The Kerry Way Ultra Lite in 2021 was the first time I&rsquo;d ever finished a race &ldquo;mid-pack&rdquo;.

            I have a strange relationship with Saucony running shoes. The Endorphin Speed was the first time I&rsquo;d bought any shoe from them and it instantly became my favourite road shoe of all time. V2 was equally good. My Endorphin Pro 1, whilst flawed, has more miles on it than any other pair of shoes I still have in rotation.
And then there are their trail shoes which have been an unmitigated disaster for me.

            I did most of my trail running over the past year in 2 pairs of Brooks Caldera 6. They did sterling work in my three Ultra DNFs and many training miles. Strangely I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen a single other runner wearing them.
I gave them a very positive review last year which I updated when I realised they had one terrible design flaw - the two parts of the upper separated during a run because they were only connected via a thin layer of glue.
