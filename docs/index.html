    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I talked about parkrun in my monster post last year on the future of Ireland&rsquo;s health. It was started in the UK in 2010 and has spread around the world. In parkrun Ireland there are over 50 events every week. You may have heard it mentioned on Operation Transformation too.
The idea is incredibly simple. Every Saturday at 9.30am, you turn up to your local parkrun and do 5km. You can sprint, run, jog, walk or amble. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/01/26/go-to-a-parkrun-this-saturday-in-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I first learned of the Montane Spine Race last year when there were some mentions online of an Irish guy winning some insanely long race and breaking the record. This turned out to be Eoin Keith who is an amazing ultra runner. He had to pull out this year in third position after breaking a rib near the start. He waited 170 miles to do so :-)

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Four years ago I ran my first marathon, in Dublin, and it was a disaster. Everything seized up at the top of my right calf around mile 10, followed a few miles later by my left calf. I hobbled the remaining 16 miles in pain. It had never happened before and it hasn&rsquo;t happened since.
I thought that was the end of my marathon &ldquo;career&rdquo; and reverted to Halves and 10k&rsquo;s until last year. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/11/20/bringing-the-carnage-to-the-dublin-city-marathon-2016/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever Googled for video reviews of running shoes, you&rsquo;ve almost definitely landed on a review by The Ginger Runner, Ethan Newberry. For a long time, that was all I knew him for and I bought several pairs after confirming that he liked them. Then I discovered Ginger Runner Live, where he does long interviews with ultra runners live on YouTube. These are my goto podcasts whilst running slowly, along with Bad Boys Running, The Ultra Runner Podcast and Adam Buxton (who may not be a runner :-) ). <a class="read-more" href="/2016/11/20/why-we-need-more-events-like-ginger-runner-virtual-run-grvr16/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of my fave things to do is watch videos made by Ultra Marathon runners and videographers. The views are always stunning and instantly make me want to go out for a run. My first attempt to do similar in Run Forest Run was a bit of a disaster as the rain killed my phone.
We&rsquo;ve had an action camera for a few years that my bro-in-law kindly gave us. It&rsquo;s a Contour GPS. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/10/02/timoleague-courtmacsherry-elephone-explorer-pro/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Our build up to Berlin had not been great. Between holidays, Red Hat Summit in SF, Red Hat Tech Exchange in Vietnam and a week of post-Vietnam illness, I only managed to get a few long runs in. D&rsquo;wife also tripped whilst running, less than a week beforehand, and smashed her face up badly. But we had done the Clonakilty 10 Miler which we both felt went well. So we flew from Dublin the day before without too many nerves. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/10/02/the-berlin-marathon-2016-a-race-for-everyone-in-a-great-city/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Intro I began this post several months ago. It started quite simply - I wanted to congratulate those behind the wonderful Waterford/Deise Greenway and encourage Cork County Council to embrace a West Cork Greenway and execute on it. The Waterford one is partially opening this week.
However the more I thought about it, the bigger the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; got. What I&rsquo;m going to present here is obvious in many places, controversial in others and possibly pure fantasy. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/09/21/greenways-byways-hedgerows-tourism-and-the-future-of-irelands-health/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Finally a book review on the blog. I&rsquo;m not sure where I heard about this book, probably Twitter, but damn it&rsquo;s a great story. I&rsquo;d never heard of John Lenihan until 3 weeks ago. Then I read this Irish Times article and my jaw was on the floor. He has not only won the Carrauntoohil mountain race 19 times, he still holds the record of 1 hour 11 minutes and 43 seconds. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/09/19/tough-as-leather-john-lenihan/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Now that I&rsquo;ve done my first trail race, it&rsquo;s time for my initial impressions of the Altra Lone Peak 3.0. Back in June I got a pair of LP 2.5 in Sports Basement in San Francisco. They were supposed to be my first pair of trail runners but I found them so comfy they immediately became my daily shoes. When I went to get another pair in Europe I learned that they were about to be replaced with the 3. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/09/19/altra-lone-peak-30-first-impressions/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>As you may have read in my previous post, I&rsquo;ve been dipping my toe into running off-road. The phrase &ldquo;trail running&rdquo; still seems pretty rare in Ireland where I see &ldquo;mountain running&rdquo; mentioned more often, and &ldquo;fell running&rdquo; in the UK.
Last week my wife spotted on the Running in Cork blog that there was a trail run on in Castlefreke/Rathbarry on Sunday 18th called Run Forest Run. It instantly got me interested as it was [a] nearby and [b] only 5 miles long. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/09/19/run-forest-run-trail-race-report/">&raquo;</a></p>
