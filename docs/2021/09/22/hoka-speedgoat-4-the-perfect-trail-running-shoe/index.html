    <section class="post-content">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been having mixed success with trail runners in 2021 which you can read about in previous mini-reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hoka Challenger ATR 5 GTX - Love the comfort and waterproofedness. But very little grip in the wet</li>
<li>Saucony Peregrine 10 - Killed my heel. Unwearable. Great grip</li>
<li>Inov-8 TrailFly Ultra G 300 Max - Heavy, blister-inducing, lethal on wet rocks. Great bounce. Probably keep using for short distances.</li>
</ul>
<p>So when I finally signed-up for the <a href="http://www.kerrywayultra.com/kerry-way-ultralite.php">Kerry Way Ultra Lite</a> after many years of &ldquo;I must I must&rdquo; (blog post coming very soon!) I started getting stressed about my footwear. I&rsquo;d used the above (and others) on various coourse recces over an extended period and nothing felt right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve avoided the Speedgoat for as long as I&rsquo;ve run offroad because every review said they were narrow. Whilst I don&rsquo;t have particularly wide feet, my poor smallest toes get destroyed over marathon+ distances so I avoid anything that is specifically called narrow.</p>
<p>But when I thought about how much I loved the ATR apart from the grip, it seemed like an obvious choice with the Vibram Megagrip. I also really enjoyed the Evo Mafate around 2019 apart from the stiffness and them falling apart.</p>
<p>Weirdly this orange colourway was temporarily much cheaper than the others on <a href="https://www.alltricks.com/Buy/hoka+speedgoat+4">Alltricks</a> so I went for it. My usual size was correct.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021/09/speedgoat4.jpg" alt="Hoka Speedgoat 4"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done three runs in them. The first was a short one on mixed surface which felt great and the second was on a ten mile recce of the KWU Lite from the start of the Old Kenmare Rd at the Kenmare end towards Killarney. That&rsquo;s all off-road but not really technical at all. They were absolutely perfect on this. Comfortable, grippy, good on wet surfaces, great on the downhills. And not too narrow! So I&rsquo;m not sure where that reputation comes from.</p>
<p>The third run was the Kerry Way Ultra Lite itself two weeks ago. And they rocked! I had many problems on the day but none of them related to my feet. In recent years I&rsquo;ve taken to taping up most/all of my toes on very long runs. And more recently on my <a href="https://conoroneill.com/2021/06/07/the-sheeps-head-way-fkt/">Sheep&rsquo;s Head Way FKT</a>, I taped my forefeet too, with Leukotape P. I did this for KWU and had zero blisters. Yes zero! That&rsquo;s over 58km of all sorts of terrain including roads.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021/09/toes.jpg" alt="Feet"></p>
<p>The cushion was incredible on the day. The wet grip wasn&rsquo;t needed much due to a dry week and I had no grip issues on the rocky bits. Not a single slip. And more impressively for such a high stack, not a single ankle roll. I had a couple of forward stumbles but that was down to my legs getting tired and me not lifting enough.</p>
<p>I was genuinely shocked at how well they worked and how great I felt at the end of the race. Sure I&rsquo;m going to lose 4 toenails but that&rsquo;s unavoidable with hammering downhill.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://wicklow.ecotrail.com/fr/course-ecotrail-wicklow/46k">Ecotrail Wicklow 46K</a> this weekend and will update this post if I have anything new to report about them.</p>
<p>But honestly, this is what I&rsquo;ll be running in offroad for the foreseeable future. Unless they release V5 :-)</p>
