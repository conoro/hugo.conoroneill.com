        <small>A very readable and useful guide for anyone starting ultra running. Big thumbs up.</small>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>I <a href="https://conoroneill.com/2017/07/23/the-chiltern-challenge-50k-conors-first-ultra-marathon/">wrote about my first 50k</a> a few weeks back. I still smile every time I think about it. I&rsquo;m already signed up for a 40 miler in the <a href="https://www.imra.ie/events/view/id/1506">Glen of Aherlow</a> in September (3 loops, so I have a get-out-of-jail) and I&rsquo;m trying to decide what my first 50 miler will be. Suffice to say, I&rsquo;m really getting into this whole trail running thing. And one of the main reasons for that is the brilliant work done by YouTubers, Instagrammers and Podcasters in this area.</p>
<p>My two fave Ultra/Trail podcasts are <a href="http://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/">Ultra Runner Podcast</a> and <a href="http://eastcoastultrapodcast.com/">East Coast Trail and Ultra Podcast</a>. They are verrrrry different beasts (pun intended) but both awesome resources for getting excited, inspired and educated about ultra running. Eric on URP is often joined by <a href="http://www.sarahlavendersmith.com/">Sarah Lavender Smith</a> and I always look forward to those episodes due to the depth of her knowledge and utter likability.</p>
<p>Which brings us to books about running. I have to admit I&rsquo;m not having a lot of success with these. Most of them are written by runners, not writers, and you can tell. I was genuinely sad to find Lizzy Hawker&rsquo;s book to be basically an unreadable mix of &ldquo;and then, and then&rdquo; with fortune cookie quotes. Lizzy is an absolute legend of a runner and I&rsquo;m in awe of her achievements. At the other end you have books like &ldquo;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&rdquo;, written by Haruki Murakami, a famous author. I have to admit I found this mind-numbing too. I have a few others on the Kindle I&rsquo;ve started but given up on. I even gave up half way through Dean Karnazes audiobook. And he&rsquo;s another person I idolize.</p>
<p>So to-date, I&rsquo;ve only really enjoyed three books about running:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.chrismcdougall.com/buy-born-to-run-from-these-sellers/">Born to Run</a> by Christopher McDougall</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nowhere-Near-First-Ultramarathon-Adventures-ebook/dp/B01KW37P5M">Nowhere Near First: Ultramarathon Adventures From The Back Of The Pack</a> by Cory Reese</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trail-Runners-Companion-Step-Step-ebook/dp/B071WDHGCW">The Trail Runner&rsquo;s Companion</a> by Sarah Lavender Smith</li>
</ol>
<p>Born to Run is that got me into running in the first place and would make even the most dedicated couch-potato excited. It&rsquo;s also the reason I ran in VFFs for a few years. Christopher&rsquo;s other book, <a href="http://www.chrismcdougall.com/buy-natural-born-heroes-from-these-sellers/">Natural Born Heroes</a>, is also a must-read. It&rsquo;s sorta about running but really it&rsquo;s about a lot more.</p>
<p>I discovered Cory&rsquo;s book in Sarah&rsquo;s book. As I mentioned in my 50K post, I read the entire thing the night before my first Ultra and it was a huge help in settling my nerves. Cory is funny, genuine and full of grit. Even if you don&rsquo;t run, buy the book, it&rsquo;ll make you want to do more.</p>
<p>And so on to The Trail Runner&rsquo;s Companion. I didn&rsquo;t just enjoy this book, it&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ll be reading over and over. It&rsquo;s a practical instruction manual for doing ultra trail running well. It&rsquo;s mixed with lovely anecdotes and all of the nuts and bolts instructions are done in a really approachable way.</p>
<p>The more I read it, as I approached the 50k, the more I realised just how badly I&rsquo;d prepared. It turns out that running around a few Irish forests and hills for 4 or 5 miles, plus doing a few road marathons, is not really how you approach an Ultra. Of course I bought the book so close to the event, that I had no chance to actually implement her advice.</p>
<p>The really important aspect of the book is that anyone of any level of ability can use it. I find a lot of online advice assumes you are already a fast runner and you are just transitioning to trails. Sarah doesn&rsquo;t do this. So a blob like me can still apply her instructions without ending up in the physio&rsquo;s office with everything torn and out of action for months.</p>
<p>If you want one take-away from the book, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;do more hill repeats&rdquo;. Something I avoid like the plague but which I&rsquo;m really going to have to embrace.</p>
<p>I said it in the last post and I&rsquo;ll say it again - &ldquo;Inspirational&rdquo; should mean &ldquo;Inspired me to action&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s what books like Sarah&rsquo;s do. You read them and you think &ldquo;ye know, I could do that, I just have to try&rdquo;. There are things I have no interest in ever doing like 24 hour track loops. But there are others that I am now seriously considering. Events like OCC, CCC, UTMB, JFK50 and hell yes, even Western States (I know, I know). Sarah&rsquo;s book gives me the training map for getting myself to a place where these are not ridiculous ambitions for a heavy 49 year old who staggers around 26 miles on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll extend something I wrote in 2015 after the London Marathon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you told me in 2008 that I’d ever run a 10k, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2009 that I’d ever run a half marathon, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2011 that I’d ever run a marathon, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2014 that I’d ever run two marathons in 5 weeks, I’d have laughed at you. If you told me in 2015 that I&rsquo;d ever run 5 marathons in a year, I&rsquo;d have laughed at you. And if you told me in 2016 that I&rsquo;d ever run 50k cross-country, I&rsquo;d have laughed at you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll update the quote again next year :-)</p>
<p>Finally, I couldn&rsquo;t do a post about running this week without mentioning <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b092l5gd">The Pacemakers</a> documentary. It ties in perfectly to what I&rsquo;m saying above. It&rsquo;s about a group of highly competitive athletes who are attending the World Championships. The twist is that they are all over 90.</p>
<p>The trailer:</p>

<p>I want to be 95 and running down a track against some other 95 year olds and trying to whip their assses. Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>If you have access to a UK VPN, go watch it now before it disappears off the BBC site. If you are Netflix, please buy broadcast rights from the BBC. If you are the BBC, please distribute this worldwide.</p>
<p>Now go buy Sarah&rsquo;s book and get started on your journey.</p>
