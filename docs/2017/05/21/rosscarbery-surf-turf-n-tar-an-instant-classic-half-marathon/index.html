      <p>This is going to be a post full of superlatives.</p>

<p>When I first heard about <a href="https://surfturfntar.com/">Surf Turf n Tar</a>, I was instantly excited. I&rsquo;d done most of the course in chunks already and it&rsquo;s currently my favourite place to run. You have every sort of terrain and views, all in a compact area.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/surf-turf-ntar.jpg" alt="Surf Turf n Tar" /></p>

<p>The race started just opposite the Celtic Ross Hotel and headed down a little road. You hear of elite ultra runners &ldquo;blowing-up&rdquo; at 50 miles. I blew up at 50 yards where both calves cramped badly as I tried to keep up with my wife.</p>

<p>So much for my brand new schoolgirl 2XU compression socks helping with that.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-05-20%2007.57.06.jpg" alt="2XU" /></p>

<p>As we ran along I was trying to figure out how the hell we were supposed to get across the inlet/estuary. There&rsquo;s always at least some bit of stream there. We bounced out on to the sand at that really cool house right on the water and ran across the sand. A few foot-dunks in puddles confirmed that wearing Altra Lone Peak 3.0 trail runners was the right choice :-) And then I spotted it, a pontoon bridge across the stream! The wee geniuses.</p>

<p>Over we ran to the relatively newly finished cliff walk and immediately dropped to a walk. Damn that&rsquo;s steep.</p>

<p>Along the road in Owneahincha and then into the &ldquo;beware the bull&rdquo; field. I was really looking forward to this section as I&rsquo;d finally get to see the old Castelfreke building up close. It&rsquo;s private property with lots of &ldquo;stay out&rdquo; signs so it was a real coup for the organisers to get permission.</p>

<p>Every time we got to a steep bit, people passed me as I was only power walking (and still in pain with my calves). But when we hit the downhills, I bombed past them like a small child with my arms outstretched relying on the grip of the LPs to keep me off my ass.</p>

<p>The forest bits were as lovely as always with amazing smells of wild garlic. Then the heavens opened and we were all saturated. But it was exactly what I needed.</p>

<p>I really like new trail above Long Strand and hope the planting of native species to replace the removed poxy pines continues.</p>

<p>Back on to the road and up to the bastard Long Strand. This is my third race which goes out on to that torture chamber. It&rsquo;s not the fact that it&rsquo;s a beach which hurts, it&rsquo;s the fact that the weird sand never becomes dense. Every footstep sinks in deep. Your legs are like lead by the end of it.</p>

<p>Here it is back in March on a foggy day.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-03-30%2015.22.26.jpg" alt="Long Strand" /></p>

<p>Then up the really steep hill I love to the best view in the area, past the holy cross. and another high speed bombing session down the other side of the hill.</p>

<p>Only 3 miles left now, so it should be a doddle. Noooooo, into the dunes of Owenahinca for more soft sand. The evil evil brilliant geniuses.</p>

<p>Back up over the cliff walk and surely it&rsquo;s just a jog along on the road? Nooooooooo again, as we&rsquo;re directed out on to the Warren beach and then on to sand that&rsquo;s even softer than Long Strand. I&rsquo;m almost staggering at this stage. And the tide is coming in close to the markers.</p>

<p>Finally the 13 mile marker. But where the hell is the finish line? The hotel is a lot more than 0.1 of a mile away. So I jog along the road, turn a corner and hurrah, the finish line.</p>

<p>Seriously, this is the kind of course that makes you want to run all the time. It may have taken my calves 6 miles to loosen up but who cares? I can&rsquo;t congratulate the organisers enough. Everything was absolutely brilliantly done and it&rsquo;s the best Half marathon course I&rsquo;ve ever run.</p>

<p>And the most amazing part of the whole thing? The medal was made of chocolate!</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-05-20%2013.41.53.jpg" alt="Medal01" /></p>

<p>It was delicious :-)</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-05-20%2014.32.25.jpg" alt="Medal02" /></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for next year and will be doing all the public parts of the route many times between now and then.</p>
