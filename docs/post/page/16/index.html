        <p>I woke up this morning to read about Brian Cowen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Innovation&rdquo; Taskforce and have spent since then utterly enraged.
In a time of crisis when men/women of vision and ability need to quickly agree a strategy and execute it with confidence, Brian Cowen assembles 28 people (plus the heads of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and representatives from the departments of Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Finance). <a class="read-more" href="/2009/06/29/we-declare-our-resolve-to-pursue-the-happiness-and-prosperity-of-the-whole-nation/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Just in from the people organising the West Cork Literary Festival:
 PJ Lynch, one of the most celebrated children’s book illustrators, will give a special Children’s Talk on Monday 6th July, as part of the West Cork Literary Festival. He will also give a Public Interview with Robert Dunbar on the evening of July 6th.
PJ has won numerous awards including the Mother Goose Award, the Christopher Medal, three times, and the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal on two occasions, first for &ldquo;The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey&rdquo; by Susan Wojciechowski, and again for “When Jessie Came Across the Sea” by Amy Hest. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/06/22/west-cork-literary-festival-update/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Deeply important piece by Ivan on food security and our future. Don&rsquo;t just read it, leave your thoughts too.
The ability of a country to feed itself and have a sustainable agri-business must surely have been a major motivator of Reddy Brennan and his team in Avonmore in the early 1970s. A man of great vision with incredible negotiation skills, he is one of the heroes of Irish industry. Our family will always be grateful to him. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/06/16/ivan-asks-can-we-feed-ourselves/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I can&rsquo;t bear to read the report. It sickens me to think what those evil scum covered up over the years.
I&rsquo;m not a religious person but I take some comfort in imagining everyone involved in the systematic abuse of children in the 20th century burning in the eternal fires of hell.
Some comfort in imagining every priest, every brother, every nun, every bishop, every arch-bishop, every cardinal, every papal nuncio, every pope who knew anything about what was happening in this country and DID NOTHING, being raped by satan every day for eternity. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/23/systematic-evil/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Those of us who are watching much less broadcast TV and more time-shifted or downloaded programmes are starting to become very uncomfortable with the monthly Sky tax just to get some intermittent BBC2/Ch4 etc.
Media companies everywhere try to stop piracy and block those outside of their borders from watching programming online on sites like Hulu. This is a battle they cannot win.
The problem they have at the moment is licensing. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/23/how-pirate-bay-could-be-the-next-news-corp/">&raquo;</a></p>
