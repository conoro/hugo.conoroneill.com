        <p>I made a quick mention of the old TB hospitals in a blog post about BCG almost two years ago. As far as I know there were lots of them. Peamount, which we drove past many times, opened in 1912 and there was also Cappagh and others.
I just got a lovely email from someone who was in such a hospital in the 1950s wondering if I&rsquo;d got any feedback. Unfortunately I hadn&rsquo;t. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/01/17/tb-hospitals-in-ireland/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We decided to head down and look at the poor dead whale in Courtmac this evening. Totally unprepared of course. Hundreds of cars down there, traffic mayhem, tons of people out on the sand taking pictures. Unfortunately we were a bit late with darkness falling and the tide was coming in fast. So only myself and Oisín ran out to grab some quick pictures. We might pop down at a better time tomorrow. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/01/15/sick-as-a-large-whale/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was given this lovely book for Christmas 2007 and finally finished it last month. What initially appears to be a coffee-table resident turned out to be one of the best books on food I&rsquo;ve ever read.
The title says it all. This is a book about pork. Every single bit of the pig gets a mention and use. The author, Stéphane Reynaud is the grandson of a village butcher from the Ardeche plateau in France. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/01/11/pork-sons-review/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again to get your nominations in for the Irish Blog Awards. The ceremony is being held in the lovely Cork International Airport Hotel on February 21.
The number of wonderful Irish blogs increases daily and I can&rsquo;t keep up with the flood of high quality writing out there. There are plenty of categories to nominate in, but you don&rsquo;t have to do all of them.

        <p>Whilst growing up from age 6-18 in Kilkenny, one group of people I never got on with were the park-keepers (&ldquo;parkies&rdquo;) in the Castle Park. They always seemed to be fun-killers.
It looks like nothing has changed in over 20 years. I watched at least 50 people walk away gutted from the park yesterday with bawling children due to this:
One person claimed it was because a child had slipped and hurt themselves on the previous day. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/12/28/frost-stops-play/">&raquo;</a></p>
