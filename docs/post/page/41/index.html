        <p>Give us €2 for every kid who wants to use the playground and shag off if you want to use it at 5pm on a Bank Holiday Saturday.
Hey, I&rsquo;ve got a great idea, €5 per beach walk from 9pm to 5.30pm with a half day on Saturday.
But the nice new pastry place goes some way towards making up for the gouge.

        <p>This site has been around for ages but I only discovered it today. It is a Google Maps mashup that allows you to click anywhere in the world and then it shows you where you would come out on the other side of the world if you dug straight down. I was stunned to see that you come out near New Zealand if you dig from Ireland.

        <p>We had an hour to kill in Cork whilst waiting for Oscar to finish one of his many activities. I told them I&rsquo;d bring them to a playground.


&ldquo;That was the worst playground ever, wasn&rsquo;t it Dad?&rdquo;. &ldquo;Like really crap, like?&rdquo;.
Any tips for playgrounds in the County Hall, Model Farm Rd, College Rd, Mardyke area?

        <p>At this stage a huge number of people have camera phones and actually use the camera to take those impromptu pictures. I remember asking why anyone would want a camera phone three years ago. What the hell would you take pictures of? Well, it turns out I had no imagination and I now take pictures of everything and anything.
Now most people take the picture and either send it by MMS to friends n family or just show it on the phone to people later. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/15/pictures-camera-phones-picture-editing-and-that-internet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Handed down through generations of sufi mystics and carried by the Priory of Sion to Bandon where it remained undiscovered in a secret vault until excavations found the ancient stone etchings, I can now reveal the best chicken tikka masala recipe on the planet.
More accurately, I was given a stocking-filler cookbook by my sister years ago which came with packets of spices. It did lay undiscovered for over five years until I finally used it to make a tikka paste and then used their recipe for chicken tikka. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/13/conors-ultra-secret-chicken-tikka-masala-recipe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you live anywhere in the Cork/Waterford/Tipp area and have fixed line broadband with any provider then you may have been having problems since last Friday. I was getting 40 kbs instead of 2 mbs since Monday rendering the internet connection almost useless. Eircom fixed it for their customers yesterday and fixed it for their competitors this morning. Normal service should have returned everywhere. Yet another reason for us all to switch over to Wimax and HSDPA wireless broadband when it gets rolled out rather than using a set of providers who clearly couldn&rsquo;t give a damn. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/10/12/broadband-is-back/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Two of my favourite automotive blogs used to be Autoblog and Jalopnik. I had to unsubscribe from both due to the huge number of posts they were doing daily which I just could not keep up with (same reason I only lasted a few weeks with Blogorrah).
