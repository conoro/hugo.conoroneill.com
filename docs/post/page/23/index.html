    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Michael Newham just left a comment on my post about car-sharing. It looks like this is going to happen next year. It&rsquo;s a great idea.
 Our company ‘Mendes - GoCar’ will be providing the car-sharing service in Cork City Centre. We hope to have it operational by May the 1st 2008.
Please see the Wikipedia article for a good overview of what Car-Sharing is about.
All our ‘GoCars’ will have dedicated parking spaces ‘GoBases’ near high residential and business nodes of population. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/12/13/car-sharing-coming-to-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The savage at the wheel of 90-L-1944 came within a hair&rsquo;s breadth of killing me, all my children, my mother in law, all of those in an oncoming vehicle and everyone in his own vehicle 10 minutes ago.
This cretin who clearly rates his own life as worthless carried out a suicidal overtaking manouvre of my car just before Bandon with a stream of cars bearing down on us. If I hadn&rsquo;t seen him in my side mirror and swerved into the road margin at the last second, there would have been a fatal three car collision. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/12/09/90-l-1944-attempted-to-murder-my-family-today/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have to apologise to Damien for not blogging this until now. He has put together one of those simple, beautifully executed ideas called Gastronom.ie. It collects all of the food writing from a set of Irish bloggers into one place. So if you are sick of bouncing around from blog to blog to blog and you really aren&rsquo;t into this whole geeky RSS idea, then you&rsquo;ll become addicted to this site. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/12/09/love-food-blogs-youll-adore-gastronomie/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This newish place is in the Midway FoodCourt, Portlaoise and is nearly successful in its attempt to do something a bit different.
I had to drive up to Dublin recently (having become over-used to the train) and stopped at Midway on the N7/N8 interchange to grab something to eat. I had spotted a newish place in there the last time I&rsquo;d stopped for coffee and I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/12/09/tapenade-bistro-on-n7n8/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>How many people are going to plump for the jesusphone in their posts? If Steve Jobs is responsible,it must be magic.

        <p>We went on our summer holidays to Barley Cove for 11 years in a row as kids. On several of those years we went to Garnish Island via Glengarrif. That was as far as I ever got on the Beara peninsula until last week when I visited Adrigole. I honestly can&rsquo;t put into words how beautiful it is down there. If I was American I&rsquo;d call it God&rsquo;s country.

 1990: Learned it existed when I started Masters in UCD 1991: Figured out email, Usenet news, Gopher. Discovered ftp.funet.fi and the world of shareware 1992: First job in S3. Email only.
