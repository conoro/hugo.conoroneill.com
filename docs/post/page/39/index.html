        <p>My Dad kindly voted for this blog in several categories in the Blog Awards earlier. He mailed me to say that it reminded him of my Granny (Mary O&rsquo;Neill) who voted for Dev eight times in the 1932 elections on both sides of the bridge in New Ross. Could you imagine if those old Cumann na mBan women were around now and decided to help the blog result?

        <p>As with all the previous episodes, this one is a zinger even if you were a C64 or (god forbid) Dragon user. I had stopped my involvement with home computers by 1987, what with being in college and discovering drink instead. So I found it particularly interesting that they mention a game called &ldquo;Head Over Heels&rdquo; which was considered by many to be the greatest example of its genre ever created. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/06/your-sinclair-rock-n-roll-years-1987-is-out/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We discovered over Christmas that you can in fact put 5 children, 2 adults and all their stuff in a Zafira+Roofbox and go from Cork to Kilkenny to Cavan to Cork. Hurrah.
On our trip back from Cavan on the joke&rsquo;s of national routes known as the N55 and N62, we got to Roscrea and Oscar decided to puke. We caught most of it in a nappy bag and then I dropped the bag as I exited it from the car. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/06/thank-you-dave/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been getting lots of contraceptive advice from men my age. It seems the only logical route is vasectomy. One of my best advisors had his done quite a while back with no adverse effects. There is only one guy in Cork who does it, Dr Pillay on Patrick St and he highly recommended him. He also (quietly) mentioned that performance would not be affected and I wouldn&rsquo;t be shooting blanks for the first thirty. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/05/you-may-feel-a-small-prick/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>So Haydn tagged me. Five things you don&rsquo;t know about me eh? Apart from my Spaghetti Hoop fetish?
1. I was Junior Irish Archery Champion in 1980. Not as impressive as it sounds. Three of us in the competition and other two were beginners. Never improved after that and gave up in mid-teens. Turns out not everyone else saw a blob of colours down the end of the field and I later found out I was short-sighted. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/01/03/curses-tagged/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Those of you who know me well also know that I&rsquo;ve spent the past few months working hard on building a new web-site called LouderVoice. We&rsquo;re coming close to launching the site properly (probably in late January or early February) but before we do we would really like to have some people help us try out the site and tell us what they think.
The plan at the moment is that we&rsquo;ll be inviting a very small number of people we know into the Beta1 phase in the next few days. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/12/19/interested-in-helping-us-test-loudervoice/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you have Windows XP and if it hasn&rsquo;t happened already then Microsoft appear to be pushing out the new release of the Internet Explorer Web Browser. They are making it optional so you have to agree to install before they do (the security centre logo in the bottom right hand corner of the screen that looks like a shield will be yellow with an exclamation mark in it).
For almost all web users who don&rsquo;t use Firefox as their browser, IE7 is a big improvement over IE6. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/12/05/youll-be-getting-internet-explorer-7-pushed-to-your-pc-from-now-on/">&raquo;</a></p>
