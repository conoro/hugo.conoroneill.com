        <p>The scandal that is the non-vaccination using BCG of children in Cork could have far-reaching implications for the health of many people under the age of 30. Both employees of the then Southern Health Board and the political appointees to the board may have had a say in implementing this negligent policy and continuing to allow it to occur since the 1970&rsquo;s. It is clear that the health of Cork children is considered less important than that of children from elsewhere in the country. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/30/my-proposed-questions-to-the-hse-under-freedom-of-information/">&raquo;</a></p>

I've wanted one of these since I saw the announcement but they are very expensive (over £100) so we went with the 16K model instead of the 48K. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/23/review-of-sinclair-zx-spectrum-16k/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This mightn&rsquo;t be a big deal to most people but it&rsquo;s a huge deal to me. If my parents hadn&rsquo;t got me a ZX Spectrum in 1982, I wouldn&rsquo;t have had the life I&rsquo;ve had. No exaggeration. Every single college and career choice I&rsquo;ve made stems from the skills I learned on that machine, which I still have (the machine, not the skills :-) ). Sure 50% of the time I was playing Jet Set Willy and Sabre Wulf but on the Speccy I learned BASIC, Forth and Z80 assembler. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/23/zx-spectrum-launched-25-years-ago-today/">&raquo;</a></p>
