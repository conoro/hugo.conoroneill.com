        <p>Our build up to Berlin had not been great. Between holidays, Red Hat Summit in SF, Red Hat Tech Exchange in Vietnam and a week of post-Vietnam illness, I only managed to get a few long runs in. D&rsquo;wife also tripped whilst running, less than a week beforehand, and smashed her face up badly. But we had done the Clonakilty 10 Miler which we both felt went well. So we flew from Dublin the day before without too many nerves. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/10/02/the-berlin-marathon-2016-a-race-for-everyone-in-a-great-city/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Intro I began this post several months ago. It started quite simply - I wanted to congratulate those behind the wonderful Waterford/Deise Greenway and encourage Cork County Council to embrace a West Cork Greenway and execute on it. The Waterford one is partially opening this week.
However the more I thought about it, the bigger the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; got. What I&rsquo;m going to present here is obvious in many places, controversial in others and possibly pure fantasy. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/09/21/greenways-byways-hedgerows-tourism-and-the-future-of-irelands-health/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Finally a book review on the blog. I&rsquo;m not sure where I heard about this book, probably Twitter, but damn it&rsquo;s a great story.

        <p>Now that I&rsquo;ve done my first trail race, it&rsquo;s time for my initial impressions of the Altra Lone Peak 3.0. Back in June I got a pair of LP 2.5 in Sports Basement in San Francisco. They were supposed to be my first pair of trail runners but I found them so comfy they immediately became my daily shoes. When I went to get another pair in Europe I learned that they were about to be replaced with the 3. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/09/19/altra-lone-peak-30-first-impressions/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>As you may have read in my previous post, I&rsquo;ve been dipping my toe into running off-road. The phrase &ldquo;trail running&rdquo; still seems pretty rare in Ireland where I see &ldquo;mountain running&rdquo; mentioned more often, and &ldquo;fell running&rdquo; in the UK.
Last week my wife spotted on the Running in Cork blog that there was a trail run on in Castlefreke/Rathbarry on Sunday 18th called Run Forest Run. It instantly got me interested as it was [a] nearby and [b] only 5 miles long. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/09/19/run-forest-run-trail-race-report/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Shortly after we moved to Bandon, over 10 years ago, I bought a bunch of Ordnance Survey maps of the area and two books by Damien Enright called &ldquo;Walks of Courtmacsherry Bay &amp; The Seven Heads&rdquo; and &ldquo;Walks in and around Kinsale&rdquo;. We had high hopes of being outdoorsy. To our shame, the most we ever did was to haul the kids along the short track in Kilbrittain woods, the even shorter one in Ballinspittle woods and the tiny bit longer one in Dromillihy woods. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/08/26/the-seven-heads-walk-and-lusitania-trail-is-one-of-west-corks-best-kept-secrets/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As has been the case so often over the past 15 years of blogging, I&rsquo;ve been very remiss in my updates. I&rsquo;ve had a ton of things I want to write about, like the Waterford Greenway and how adventure/outdoor tourism could be a much bigger business here. But that&rsquo;s for my holidays.
Today, as I move this blog to Hugo and GitHub Pages (what a journey it has had!), I thought I&rsquo;d just give an update on my running. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/07/10/a-year-of-running-updates/">&raquo;</a></p>

The official web-site which holds the records of the Oireachtas is the kind of incompetent mess that can only have been designed to be that way on purpose.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been running slowly since 2009. This year has seen two and a half marathons so far, with the Clon Half probably ending the year nicely. But since the very first run I&rsquo;ve struggled with audio. I think most people listen to music and I&rsquo;ve done that a bit but I&rsquo;ve spent far more time listening to Podcasts. I listened to Kermode and Mayo on my first Half Marathon in Dingle in 2010 and I listened to them again a few weeks ago in Dingle in the 2015 Half. <a class="read-more" href="/2015/10/04/i-ve-finally-found-a-running-audio-setup-that-works/">&raquo;</a></p>
