        <p>I can&rsquo;t bear to read the report. It sickens me to think what those evil scum covered up over the years.
I&rsquo;m not a religious person but I take some comfort in imagining everyone involved in the systematic abuse of children in the 20th century burning in the eternal fires of hell.
Some comfort in imagining every priest, every brother, every nun, every bishop, every arch-bishop, every cardinal, every papal nuncio, every pope who knew anything about what was happening in this country and DID NOTHING, being raped by satan every day for eternity. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/23/systematic-evil/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Those of us who are watching much less broadcast TV and more time-shifted or downloaded programmes are starting to become very uncomfortable with the monthly Sky tax just to get some intermittent BBC2/Ch4 etc.
Media companies everywhere try to stop piracy and block those outside of their borders from watching programming online on sites like Hulu. This is a battle they cannot win.
The problem they have at the moment is licensing. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/23/how-pirate-bay-could-be-the-next-news-corp/">&raquo;</a></p>

Presented by Bord Bia, there are show gardens, craft centre, artisan food market and a family fun and learning zone.

        <p>My old college buddy Eoghan Whelan has more metal in him due to sports injuries than the average Terminator. As a result, he knows more about pain and injury than most. For the past while he has run a Pain Relief and Injury Rehabilitation Clinic in Dundalk and he now has the beginnings of a blog to go with it.

You can expect to see a lot of information about the treatments in which he specialises (particularly Frequency Specific Microcurrent) appearing on the site in the coming weeks. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/01/relief-for-what-ails-you/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This won&rsquo;t be a long review, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be. Fenn&rsquo;s Quay gave us a fantastic meal last Saturday night with wonderful service in a lovely room. You can&rsquo;t ask for more than that.
My lovely parents were down in Cork for the weekend for the GAA thingy and offered to bring Catherine and me out for a meal. We&rsquo;d heard great things about Fenn&rsquo;s Quay from my sister and Julian Alubaidy and, wanting somewhere new to us, booked it. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/04/23/fenns-quay-is-a-gem/">&raquo;</a></p>

Now you can be informed.

What John Handelaar has done over at kildarestreet.com with the help of some other great people is deeply important. Quite simply, the Dáil record is now properly accessible rather than just available. The site enables you to do the following:
 Read a dramatically-more-legible version of the Dáil Record going back to January 2004 Search that record by speeches or written questions, or by speaker, or by date or date range Sign up for email alerts for when a search query you&rsquo;re interested changes Sign up for email alerts whenever a TD of your choosing says something or asks a question which generated a written reply Subscribe to RSS feeds for individual TDs or for search queries This isn&rsquo;t just important for the content you find but also for the content that you don&rsquo;t find. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/04/23/a-thriving-democracy/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>You don&rsquo;t need to be an economist to know that media companies are suffering hugely in this recession. Their reliance on advertising makes them incredibly sensitive to downturns.
When you have a radio show that addresses a focused engaged specific audience, you would think that it would be a gift both for the broadcaster and those advertising to that audience. Thus C103&rsquo;s decision to axe David Young&rsquo;s &ldquo;West Cork Today&rdquo; programme frankly boggles the mind. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/04/14/c103-loses-the-plot/">&raquo;</a></p>
