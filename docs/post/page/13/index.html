        <p>Margaret Jordan pointed out on Friday in Facebook that the 1911 Census data is now online. Ever since, a bunch of us have been searching and learning. I&rsquo;ve been looking up O&rsquo;Neill, ONeill, Neill, Flynn, Meaney, Foley, Doran, Wall and Walls to see which of my ancestors I could identify and send them on to my Mum and Dad.
I was thrilled to find this record of my Granny Mary, her parents and siblings. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/08/30/1911-census-full-of-gems/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The stats around Facebook in Ireland are staggering, they are racing towards 1 millions active users here. That just blows my mind. Some are predicting they&rsquo;ll have more pageviews globally than Google by next year!
Whilst I initially didn&rsquo;t have much time for it, coming from the open blogging world, bit by bit its value for me has grown. Even at the simplest level, it is the only site where many people I know from school and college ever congregate online. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/08/28/facebook-and-you/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s been said by many others too but Twitter is seriously denting my blogging. Why write an entire post when most of the time 140 chars will do?
But what will be remembered and found in years to come? Watching Chris Moyles on &ldquo;Who Do You Think You Are?&rdquo; really drove home the importance of historical records. My mother ran into a brick wall with her genealogy research a few years ago once she got into the 19th Century. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/07/27/phew-nearly-missed-july/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Deeply important piece by Ivan on food security and our future. Don&rsquo;t just read it, leave your thoughts too.
The ability of a country to feed itself and have a sustainable agri-business must surely have been a major motivator of Reddy Brennan and his team in Avonmore in the early 1970s. A man of great vision with incredible negotiation skills, he is one of the heroes of Irish industry. Our family will always be grateful to him. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/06/16/ivan-asks-can-we-feed-ourselves/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I can&rsquo;t bear to read the report. It sickens me to think what those evil scum covered up over the years.
I&rsquo;m not a religious person but I take some comfort in imagining everyone involved in the systematic abuse of children in the 20th century burning in the eternal fires of hell.
Some comfort in imagining every priest, every brother, every nun, every bishop, every arch-bishop, every cardinal, every papal nuncio, every pope who knew anything about what was happening in this country and DID NOTHING, being raped by satan every day for eternity. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/23/systematic-evil/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Those of us who are watching much less broadcast TV and more time-shifted or downloaded programmes are starting to become very uncomfortable with the monthly Sky tax just to get some intermittent BBC2/Ch4 etc.
Media companies everywhere try to stop piracy and block those outside of their borders from watching programming online on sites like Hulu. This is a battle they cannot win.
The problem they have at the moment is licensing. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/05/23/how-pirate-bay-could-be-the-next-news-corp/">&raquo;</a></p>
