    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the Bandon FEWS system which sends an SMS when the river at the bridge hits a certain level. It must be a life-saver for many businesses and people in the town.

I have had a few thoughts on other things we could do with that live river-level data for the community. Web-apps, Twitter integration, Analytics, Trends etc etc.
However, despite several communications, I have been unable to get any response from Cork County Council about getting access to the live data. <a class="read-more" href="/2011/11/16/announcing-bandon-flood-early-warning-system-on-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Over on my tech blog recently, I mentioned dumping Sky TV and getting an Ariva 120 box. This is a combination satellite and digital terrestrial receiver. It costs an amazing €99 and you never have to pay another thing. You disconnect your Sky box, plug the satellite lead and aerial lead into the Ariva and you&rsquo;re done.
Until yesterday I had only used the satellite bit which gives you BBC etc. <a class="read-more" href="/2011/09/11/getting-free-digital-tv-in-west-cork-on-rabbit-ears/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I don&rsquo;t know how I missed this when it was announced recently. A superb initiative from Cork County Council. They have put aside €300,000 to help with provision of enterprise centres / hot desk facilities in County Towns. This will include a contribution of up to €35,000 for tech and hot desk provision.
The downside is that is doesn&rsquo;t cover building rental but surely some joined-up thinker in the Council is already working on a deal with NAMA to get properties for rental at 10c on the Euro or less? <a class="read-more" href="/2011/08/07/cork-coco-to-support-hot-desking-setups-in-county-towns/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Well done to Gavin Sheridan and the crew at The Story. They took NAMA&rsquo;s pathetic PDF release of the properties it owns, extracted the data into the fantastic Google Fusion Tables and then mapped the results into Google Maps.

Go on, you know you won&rsquo;t be able to help yourself. I immediately zoomed into Bandon to see what was there. Surprisingly few properties actually.
Head on over to the site and click on any dot of interest to see what property it is. <a class="read-more" href="/2011/08/02/see-where-the-nama-properties-are-on-google-maps/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Ireland has more than enough Corporate Lawyers, Audit Accountants, Bankers and Civil Servants. What it needs are creative people building products, services and businesses.

The internet is one place where we see a wonderful synthesis of creativity in design and engineering.

        <p>After the pork recall debacle, you&rsquo;d thing the FSAI would get a bit of cop-on but obviously they need to keep inventing make-work to keep themselves in jobs. Their latest wheeze is to try and ban Raw Milk. Not bleach-cleaned chicken nuggets or mechanically recovered meat burgers or sausages with 53% &ldquo;meat&rdquo;. No, they want to ban a product that some people actively seek out and choose to drink.

        <p>It has always struck me as ridiculous that the only place in all of West Cork where you can get a short-term Hot-Desk is in Macroom. We&rsquo;re not that far from it but it&rsquo;s still a horrible drive from Bandon.
We continue to struggle as a small Internet business with 6 Mbs ADSL (512kbs up). If we were slightly closer to the exchange we might get 12Mbs. Those responsible for allowing Fibre connectivity to bypass Bandon have ensured that there will never be a technology cluster in the town. <a class="read-more" href="/2011/06/29/hot-desking-office-space-in-bantry/">&raquo;</a></p>

And didn&rsquo;t exactly take off like a rocket with only 3 posts in 2001!

2005 was the year I really got going when I moved from Blogspot to Wordpress. <a class="read-more" href="/2011/04/17/10-years-a-bloggin/">&raquo;</a></p>
