    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>My old friend and classmate from college Dee Burke read my review of The Four Seasons and sent me her review of La Maison Troisgros in France. I asked if she&rsquo;d mind if I posted it here due to the drooling all over the keyboard that resulted when I read it. She said sure. So, for the first time in the five years this blog has been in existence - a posting from someone other than Mr Creosote: &gt; Peter had heard of &ldquo;La Maison Troisgros&rdquo; for the first time when he did a management course in the IMI years ago. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/01/19/guest-blogger-review-la-maison-troisgros/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We brought the rain with us from Cork and it lashed down as we were driven out to the Salt Lick BBQ which is, as they (and probably Ned Flanders) would put it &ldquo;a heck of a long way out yonder&rdquo;. It is also in a dry county where the sale (but not consumption) of alcohol is illegal. I think many of my Irish readers have probably had some sort of aneurysm reading that last sentence. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/01/18/salt-lick-bbq-driftwood-texas-can-i-have-a-franchise-please/">&raquo;</a></p>

UPDATE: Goddammit, Baz was right. It is a poxing mini-van not an SUV (the sliding door is what gives it away).

        <p>Yer, I want dat wun:
So we only got a massive SUV instead of a planet-sized one on our arrival in Texas. We&rsquo;re here for the week and I hope I keep my wits about me and take plenty of Nokia Crap-cam pictures. The first one will be of our town runabout with three rows of seats and what sounds like a V6 under the bonnet. I spun the tyres when taking off gently from some traffic lights and squealed them every time I turned a corner. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/01/16/dammit-they-were-out-of-lincoln-navigators/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;formal&rdquo; family holiday in 2005 - a week in Rosslare
with the extended family was it for us. As year-end approached,
weariness grew. So we threw caution to the wind, threw the children to
their granny and headed down from Cavan to Capital City for some
pampering and unashamed luxury.
