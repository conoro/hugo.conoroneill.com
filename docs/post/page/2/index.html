        <p>Like many people I&rsquo;ve been enthralled by Eoin Keith&rsquo;s Ultra running exploits since I first discovered this crazy sport. Whether it&rsquo;s his Spine Race wins in crazy weather or his FKT from Mizen to Malin, he makes you want to push yourself and try things.
My wife and I are doing the Liverpool to Manchester 50 Mile Ultra very soon (oh god it really is very very soon) and we flip-flop between terror and huge excitement over the adventure. <a class="read-more" href="/2018/03/17/eoin-keith-barkley-marathons/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I read some reviews of the Sense Pro Max last year and they looked like a good pair of mixed surface running shoes. However they came with the usual Salomon price tag and I didn&rsquo;t have a specific need for them.
Fast-forward to January this year and I started getting worried about the footwear I was going to use in my first 50 Miler, the Liverpool to Manchester Ultra. Then I spotted that the Salomons were half price on Wiggle. <a class="read-more" href="/2018/03/12/the-fatally-flawed-salomon-sense-pro-max/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>2017 was probably the year I stopped feeling odd when calling myself a runner. I achieved a bunch of new things in running, including my first 50k, and managed to do just over 1000 miles for the year.
Start running now If you are thinking of taking up running in the new year, go for it. No excuses.

        <p>I really wonder about headphone manufacturers and their testing. I own everything from no-name €10 Chinese wired earbuds to €100+ Jaybird X3s and every single one of them is problematic for running.
In the US alone, over 550,000 people ran a marathon in 2016. Scale that globally (with a 13% growth rate) and that&rsquo;s a substantial, defined, receptive, target market.
My goto pair for the past 2 years are SMS In-Ear Wired Sport earbuds. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/09/06/headphone-companies-big-opportunity-to-own-the-marathon-market/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I wrote about my first 50k a few weeks back. I still smile every time I think about it. I&rsquo;m already signed up for a 40 miler in the Glen of Aherlow in September (3 loops, so I have a get-out-of-jail) and I&rsquo;m trying to decide what my first 50 miler will be. Suffice to say, I&rsquo;m really getting into this whole trail running thing.

Any chance we can narrow &quot;inspirational&quot; to mean &quot;inspired me to action&quot; instead of &quot;isn&#39;t that a nice story&quot;?
&mdash; Conor O&#39;Neill (@conoro) July 19, 2017 
It was partially driven by the silly overuse of &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; but also by the fact that I was inspired to run 50km last weekend by all of the amazing Ultrarunners in the US and Europe and the stories they tell via YouTube, Vimeo, Blogs, Twitter, Instagram, magazines and books. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/07/23/the-chiltern-challenge-50k-conors-first-ultra-marathon/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned as I&rsquo;ve dipped my toe into off-road running in Ireland is that we don&rsquo;t really do trails. Apart from forest paths, the bulk of what I&rsquo;ve found is wet muddy bog. This causes me two problems - it&rsquo;s difficult to run in it and American-style trail runners are useless in this environment. My poor Altra Lone Peak 3.0 may as well be slick tyres coming down from Mullaghmesha Mountain. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/06/11/quick-reviews-of-inov8-xclaw-275-trail-runners-leki-voyager-poles/">&raquo;</a></p>

When I first heard about Surf Turf n Tar, I was instantly excited. I&rsquo;d done most of the course in chunks already and it&rsquo;s currently my favourite place to run. You have every sort of terrain and views, all in a compact area.
The race started just opposite the Celtic Ross Hotel and headed down a little road. You hear of elite ultra runners &ldquo;blowing-up&rdquo; at 50 miles. <a class="read-more" href="/2017/05/21/rosscarbery-surf-turf-n-tar-an-instant-classic-half-marathon/">&raquo;</a></p>
