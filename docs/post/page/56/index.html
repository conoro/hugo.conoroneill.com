        <p>I&rsquo;m delighted to report that the first Farmer&rsquo;s Market in Bandon was a resounding success despite the awful weather. I&rsquo;m already looking forward to next months and I hope they consider moving it to every week if the crowds hold up.
First off, apologies for the shockingly bad quality of the photos. I have the aesthetic eye of a blind person.
I headed up initially just after 10am with two of the kids. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/04/01/inaugural-bandon-farmers-market-a-huge-success/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I&rsquo;ve made a few half-hearted attempts at doing chicken wings over the years. Usually in the oven and usually burnt beyond all recognition. I now realise that you add the sauce afterwards as anything with sugar will burn.
Recently I spotted a bunch of blog postings about buffalo wings (mainly related to the Superbowl I think) and decided I wanted to try and do them properly. I&rsquo;ve always found people raving about Elephant &amp; Castle chicken wings to be a bit weird. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/31/buffalo-wings-mmm-tasty-but-not-so-hot/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have written some very complimentary things about Murphy&rsquo;s Ice Cream recently. In addition, Kieran&rsquo;s blog has become, in a few short weeks, one of the best in the country, IMHO. I gave Kieran a few tips on blogging software recently and was gob-smacked when he sent me a fabulous gift of some ice-cream and chocolate sauce (via the very facilitative Urru).
Now that I have made that disclosure, I feel comfortable in continuing to rave about their products. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/31/ice-cream-disclosure/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Months after I signed up, I finally got access to the new Yahoo Mail Beta programme. I&rsquo;ve been using Yahoo mail as my &ldquo;we are a web-site, give us an email address&rdquo; address for over ten years now. In that time, I don&rsquo;t think it has really improved one iota in usability apart from the addition of spam catching. It has always been slow, clunky and riddled with obnoxious massive ads. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/31/yahoo-mail-beta-finally-initial-impressions/">&raquo;</a></p>

MAC to his surgical team: What can I tell you? A few ground rules. No bombing, no running, no petting, no diving and no inflatables. In fact, probably best to leave all swimming related activities until later ; this is after all, an operating theatre.

        <p>The traditional Mother&rsquo;s Day treat in our house is to get a nice simple poached eggs on toast breakfast in bed which the kids can easily help with. This year, as wifey is up the pole, soft eggs were a no-no and hard poached eggs are pooh, so we needed an alternative.
On Saturday, in a flash of inspiration I checked out &ldquo;Easy Entertaining&rdquo; by Darina Allen. My lovely parents got this for me at Christmas. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/27/tips-for-fathers-day/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We were in The English Market on Friday getting a few bits. I was buying the membrillo in Iago which is the bigger of the two cheese places. In passing, as Catherine is preggers, I asked if they had any pasteurised goat&rsquo;s cheese. The person I asked didn&rsquo;t know but one of the other ladies came over and said that no goat&rsquo;s cheese or sheep&rsquo;s cheese is safe to eat during pregnancy because listeria is not killed by pasteurisation. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/27/goats-cheese-and-pregnancy/">&raquo;</a></p>
