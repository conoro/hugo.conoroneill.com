        <p>I finally got to see [Bubba Ho-Tep](http://www.bubbahotep.com/) recently. What an odd but completely beguiling movie. I sat down to watch it with a bunch of pre-conceptions and expectations. A low-budget ($500K) movie starring Bruce Campbell as Elvis and Ossie Davis as JFK fighting a mummy in an Old Folk's home in East Texas - how could you not have ideas as to what sort of movie it would be? I spent a summer in Stuttgart during college working in an old folk's home. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/08/14/tcb-baby-taking-care-of-business/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>To quote the great Bill Hicks. Yesterday I tried to create a new classic instant meal. I decided to traverse the extremes from MSG to Midleton by creating a masterpiece consisting of Koka Chicken "flavoured" Noodles, leftover sausages and Organic Rocket Pesto from the Midleton Farmers market. Oh dear, won't be having that again.

        <p>I'll just have to give up the drink next week. [Hugh McLeod of Gaping Void](http://www.gapingvoid.com/) fame has arranged for [Irish bloggers to get their hands on free bottles of Stormhoek](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001646.html) too. Hope they give me some Sauvignon Blanc. New Zealand Marlborough Sauvignon is pretty much all we drink but we have got some good bottles of South African Sauvignon recently which are far far better than anything coming out of Chile. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/08/10/woo-hoo-free-wine-for-irish-bloggers/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We are very happy to announce our early alpha re-launch of our company web-site as a Wordpress blog. We hope that releasing before completion will accelerate it's development. The main point of re-structuring as a blog is to try and create a community forum for discussing Enterprise Systems, in particular Enterprise Storage Software and Systems. Ideally many of those working in the Irish divisions of storage companies such as EMC, Dell, StorageTek, SUN etc will take advantage of the site and put an Irish spin on the discussions. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/08/08/argolon-solutions-company-web-site-re-launched-as-a-wordpress-blog/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We had our week down in Rosslare. I'd call it a holiday but there were 8 kids in the house. My lovely sisters and parents gave us the night off on Wednesday so we had to pick where to eat. Catherine wasn't in the mood for Italian so it was no to Dolce Vita. Heaven's Above sounded good. Dunbrody House was too far.
