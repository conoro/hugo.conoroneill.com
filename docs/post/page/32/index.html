        <p>[**The Tipping Point**](http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/)  &lt;div class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;This book is seven years old but still a zinger. Read it on plane to Amsterdam and back. Loved every page.&lt;/div&gt;  ![](http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/5outof5.gif) &lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;  Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s book really rocketed him into worldwide fame. Everything he has done since has been eagerly awaited. I only got around to reading The Tipping Point on Thursday and I&rsquo;m glad I finally did.
The basic idea behind the book is that there are identifiable conditions and actions which cause something to become wildly popular or successful - things that become epidemics (in the wider sense of the word). <a class="read-more" href="/2007/06/03/review-of-the-tipping-point/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We lost water around 2am Saturday and it returned dark brown at around 2pm. Does anyone know what the back story is and whether the water is safe to drink?
I would encourage Cork CoCo to immediately fire the arsehole at the end of the &ldquo;All other emergencies&rdquo; phone line listed in the Green Pages.

        <p>It really is a fun day out. Most of the town seems to head up.
Fionn will love the animals, Sib√©al will screech at the dogs and the eldest boys will demand ice-cream from the second they arrive.
I&rsquo;ll take more pictures of huge cows which impress me every time. Hope to catch some show-jumping too.
Head towards Clon, turn right for Dunmanway/Recycling facility, right again about half a mile down and you hit it after another mile or two. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/05/18/annnnnnd-the-bandon-show-is-on-this-sunday/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Haydn Shaughnessy is opening a new art gallery in the Pink Elephant in Harbour View overlooking the sea. As its name suggests it is dedicated to Innovative Contemporary Art.

        <p>The scandal that is the non-vaccination using BCG of children in Cork could have far-reaching implications for the health of many people under the age of 30. Both employees of the then Southern Health Board and the political appointees to the board may have had a say in implementing this negligent policy and continuing to allow it to occur since the 1970&rsquo;s. It is clear that the health of Cork children is considered less important than that of children from elsewhere in the country. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/04/30/my-proposed-questions-to-the-hse-under-freedom-of-information/">&raquo;</a></p>
