        <p>Last Saturday, the world was my oyster. Wife n kids were in Cavan, house to myself, I could do anything I liked. Except I&rsquo;m off booze so getting blotto was out of the question, I&rsquo;m on a diet so a huge steak n chips was off the menu and I hate sport so a day of Premiership football would be torture. But I was still totally buzzed about making sausages after the Hugh Fearnley-Wearnley-Guernley Course in Ballymaloe. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/09/is-that-a-sausage-in-your-pocket-or-are-you-just-glad-to-see-me/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We spent the halloween weekend down in Rosslare. I know it is now a mini-Dublin but it&rsquo;s a perfect spot for all of the extended family to meet up. There is one shop I want to mention simply because they deserve to be much better known. &ldquo;Kate&rsquo;s Farm Shop&rdquo; is just off the Duncannon Roundabout towards Duncannon. I found it accidentally during the summer when I went for a &ldquo;lets get the kids to sleep for a hour&rdquo; drive. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/05/wexford-farm-shops-and-citroen-sms/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>After Caroline&rsquo;s wedding, we hung on for another day in Killarney to get a break from our four darlings. I think maybe I had passed through once before but could remember nothing of the place so I had no expectations. OK, I did assume we would find a certain level of paddywhackery but jesus, it turned out to be Brigadoon transplanted. I have never ever seen so many shops selling such tat in all my life. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/05/killarney-land-of-the-celtic-tigers-aran-sweater/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Edward Twomey was Mr Clonakilty Black Pudding. I was sad to read in my local Bandon Opinion last week that he had passed away. The story of Edward and his pudding is one that I think very few people know. Since I started eating out, I have often run into Clonakilty Black Pudding on menus. I have also seen many articles raving about it. But until I moved to Bandon, I honestly thought that it was a general description for all pudding from the town. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/04/the-king-of-black-puddin-passes-away/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The war on weight continues and I am debating whether to start a weekly post on the Bloggers Belly Bulkometer. Half a stone in a week is not bad going. Those couple of bottles of wine and cans of Becks each week were obviously contributing _slightly _to the inexorable move towards Rick Waller territory. Tonight will be a major trial. Curry with brown rice, no naans and no booze in the house on my own. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/04/unfit-cough-moi-wheeze-what-was-the-question-again/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Way back in 1999, I was on a week long training course in Stanford which had been arranged by Enterprise Ireland. It was a fabulous week and I learned a hell of a lot about entrepreneurship, the mindset of Silicon Valley and what the hell VC was all about. But the best bits of the trip were the site visits to various companies. Some were rubbish; Cisco sent in their Software Configuration Manager to tell us about version control. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/02/the-coolest-place-on-the-planet-to-work-ideo/">&raquo;</a></p>
