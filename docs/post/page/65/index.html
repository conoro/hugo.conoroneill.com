    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Edward Twomey was Mr Clonakilty Black Pudding. I was sad to read in my local Bandon Opinion last week that he had passed away. The story of Edward and his pudding is one that I think very few people know. Since I started eating out, I have often run into Clonakilty Black Pudding on menus. I have also seen many articles raving about it. But until I moved to Bandon, I honestly thought that it was a general description for all pudding from the town. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/04/the-king-of-black-puddin-passes-away/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The war on weight continues and I am debating whether to start a weekly post on the Bloggers Belly Bulkometer. Half a stone in a week is not bad going. Those couple of bottles of wine and cans of Becks each week were obviously contributing _slightly _to the inexorable move towards Rick Waller territory. Tonight will be a major trial. Curry with brown rice, no naans and no booze in the house on my own. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/04/unfit-cough-moi-wheeze-what-was-the-question-again/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Way back in 1999, I was on a week long training course in Stanford which had been arranged by Enterprise Ireland. It was a fabulous week and I learned a hell of a lot about entrepreneurship, the mindset of Silicon Valley and what the hell VC was all about. But the best bits of the trip were the site visits to various companies. Some were rubbish; Cisco sent in their Software Configuration Manager to tell us about version control. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/11/02/the-coolest-place-on-the-planet-to-work-ideo/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I raced back to Bandon from Ballymaloe, jumped into the interview suit, thanked Mary and Claire for risking their mental health by minding our four for two days and shot off with wife riding shotgun to Killarney. The Cork-Killarney road is now my most hated road in the country. 30 mph from Crookstown to a few miles outside Ballyvourney. We arrived about 30 minutes before the meal was due to start. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/24/sweeeeettttttttt-caroline/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The long awaited day finally arrived last saturday. For my Christmas present last year, the world&rsquo;s best wife got me a place at Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pig in A Day&rdquo; course in Ballymaloe Cookery School. I hared it over to Shanagarry early on Saturday and arrived just in time. In my gormless naivete, I thought it would be an up-close-and-personal session with maybe 6-10 people. It never struck me that this was not financially feasible. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/24/hugh-pugh-barney-mcgrew-cuthbert-dibble-and-conor/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m really hitting the limit of my thirty words of German. Until recently, my experience of German cuisine has been limited to halbe-hanchen mit frites, Curry Wurst and Kartoffelklösse. And ya know, when booze is involved, there is nothing better. But as I mentioned in my recent review, Otto has changed my view of German cooking forever. Last weekend caused me to add several inches to my girth when the parents took me out on Friday and then they baby-sat on Saturday so myself and Catherine could go out. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/19/ein-klein-nacht-essen/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Bless me father for I have sinned. It has been four years since my last Citroën. My first car was a Citroën BX which I bought off my sister for &pound;2000 in about 1992. A complete and utter piece of crap. God I loved that car. A month after I bought it, I discovered the front sub-frame was rusted through and needed to be replaced. That cost over a grand and after that the car sat pointing towards the sky. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/18/repentent-ex-citroeniste/">&raquo;</a></p>
