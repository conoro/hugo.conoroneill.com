So here he is, just home, Spongebob.

There is an excellent obituary on the Washington Post site.
Lovely quotes on Yahoo.

        <p>I was gutted to read in CAR that LJK Setright passed away recently. I started reading CAR when I was 14 years old and continue to do so despite his absence for the past few years.
As a kid, I checked out most of the motoring magazines and CAR was the only one I read where I felt I was learning something, rather than just reading pseudo-ads. For a short while in the late 80&rsquo;s I tried Performance Car but to be honest that was only because of Clarkson. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/12/07/ljk-passes-away/">&raquo;</a></p>
