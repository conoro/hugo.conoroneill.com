        <p>The long awaited day finally arrived last saturday. For my Christmas present last year, the world&rsquo;s best wife got me a place at Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pig in A Day&rdquo; course in Ballymaloe Cookery School. I hared it over to Shanagarry early on Saturday and arrived just in time. In my gormless naivete, I thought it would be an up-close-and-personal session with maybe 6-10 people. It never struck me that this was not financially feasible. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/24/hugh-pugh-barney-mcgrew-cuthbert-dibble-and-conor/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m really hitting the limit of my thirty words of German. Until recently, my experience of German cuisine has been limited to halbe-hanchen mit frites, Curry Wurst and Kartoffelklösse. And ya know, when booze is involved, there is nothing better. But as I mentioned in my recent review, Otto has changed my view of German cooking forever. Last weekend caused me to add several inches to my girth when the parents took me out on Friday and then they baby-sat on Saturday so myself and Catherine could go out. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/19/ein-klein-nacht-essen/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Bless me father for I have sinned. It has been four years since my last Citroën. My first car was a Citroën BX which I bought off my sister for &pound;2000 in about 1992. A complete and utter piece of crap. God I loved that car. A month after I bought it, I discovered the front sub-frame was rusted through and needed to be replaced. That cost over a grand and after that the car sat pointing towards the sky. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/18/repentent-ex-citroeniste/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Two weeks ago I spotted a sign near our house for &ldquo;All Ireland Harness Racing&rdquo; in Barryroe, about 10 miles down towards the coast. I had missed a lot of the local events in the latter part of the summer, so I figured this might be a bit of fun for us all to check out. We headed down with C&amp;T following in their car. Just as we were about to fall into the Atlantic, we turned into a huge field which, according to my map, is very near the townland of Turkeyland. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/18/harness-racing-not-just-for-dublin-skangers/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was recently out on a business dinner with some Dutch customers to &ldquo;Man Fridays&rdquo; in Kinsale. This appears to be one of the most famous restaurants in Kinsale and is nestled in a fabulous location overlooking the harbour. Parking in that part of Kinsale was, as ever, a nightmare. I eventually strapped two dinghys to my car and moored it off the promenade. Overall I was very disappointed with the food but the Dutch guys loved it, so go figure. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/18/man-friday-not-so-hot-on-monday/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We finally bit the bullet and took a trip to Frank, Helen and the two boys in Macclesfield en famille. The six of us headed down to Cork airport last saturday morning bright and early. The Servisair genius at check-in put us in three separate rows. She was either as thick as two short planks or bitter over her fabulous career. Either way, Catherine had Fionn, I had Ois &amp; Shibs and poor Oscar had to sit on his own for take-off. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/13/six-go-mad-in-macclesfield/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Run off my feet this week so blogging has been even lighter than usual. Two health related stories caught my eye: Discoverers of H.Pylori get Nobel Prize This is fantastic. I&rsquo;ve had the treatment and unfortunately it appears I am in the 10% for whom the little bastard bacteria are not the problem. My problem is more likely to be Curry, Coffee and Sauvignon Blanc. The discovery that Helicobacter Pylori is responsible for the majority of stomach ulcers is often used by the alternative medicine brigade to beat up &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; medicine. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/10/06/quick-health-round-up/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Maria, our summer student, finished up on Friday. We bounced around a few ideas for nosh and settled on something we figured everyone would like - Scoozi&rsquo;s on Winthrop Ave just near the GPO in Cork. Great buzz in the place on arrival and no delay getting seated (well it was 5.30 on a Friday). A bit disappointed that there was no beer on the menu - I had imagined big jugs of the stuff in the middle of the table.&nbsp; A few bottles of Chianti did the trick and the hard-liquor-drinkers just had to wait for the pub. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/09/26/scoozis-good-for-a-friday-night-bash/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The parents are in Spain and my mother gave me a shout to see if I wanted anything whilst she was there. The last time she got me a fab selection of Chorizo and Salami which I am still working through. So I just asked for the same again. But I also asked her if she would keep her eye out for Smoked Paprika - the main flavour in Chorizo.
