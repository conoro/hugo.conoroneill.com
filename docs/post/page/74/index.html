        <p>Burger Blogs seem to be appearing everywhere but this guy Two-Twenty is an animal!
It turns out that Anthony Bourdain&rsquo;s Les Halles restaurant does burgers too. Bourdain became famous because of his book &ldquo;Kitchen Confidential&rdquo; which gave the low-down on the high-jinks in a restaurant kitchen. A great read.
His &ldquo;Cook&rsquo;s Tour&rdquo; follow-up was less hyped but also a very good read. The associated TV series was pretty poor.
His &ldquo;Les Halles Cookbook&rdquo; is fabulous but I&rsquo;ve only read about a quarter of it so far. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/06/29/burgertastic/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Aged 22, Patrick died in his sleep last monday night. He was buried at Shanganagh Cemetery yesterday after a heart-breaking funeral mass in Shankill. I didn&rsquo;t know Patrick that well, I met him maybe once or twice a year when visiting Eoin and Jill. But the short life of this young man should be celebrated as a example of achievement in the face of overwhelming adversity.
Nine years ago, Patrick was hit by a car and suffered massive head trauma. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/06/25/patrick-kevin-pierce-rip/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The first 3 years of this blog consisted almost entirely of baby announcements for my friends. I guess to be consistent it should also let friends know about those who have passed away. It is obviously a bit clueless to claim that the internet (and blogs in particular) democratises the news but I have to admit that I only buy a newspaper now on Friday, Saturday and Sunday - Friday for the jobs section, Saturday for the food/property section in De Paper and Sunday for the TV bit of the Sunday Times. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/06/25/births-and-deaths/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of the best foodie blogs out there isA Hamburger Today. The writing is top class and the enthusiasm for the food shines through.
But it has got me thinking about the complete lack of burger variety in this country.

The following is an exceprt from his winning entry:"Pine nut, which is a nut, but it's also the name of a town. Pistachio nut. Red pistachio nut. Natural, all natural white pistachio nut." 
This balanced his unfortunate lack of awards at the Crossmahon Sports day yesterday. The competition in the Senior Infants category was just too tough and his mid-placing in both running and muscial chairs may have scarred him for life. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/06/20/best-in-show/">&raquo;</a></p>
