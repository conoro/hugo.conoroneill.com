We arrived back from our much-needed and many-years-delayed holiday to France yesterday (long blog post to follow soon on that). A few hours later Catherine picked up a j-cloth in the kitchen sink to find&hellip;&hellip;a bat!
It was absolutely tiny, barely bigger than my thumb and we had no idea what to do with it. I gently picked it up with a cloth (are they disease carriers? <a class="read-more" href="/2008/08/31/bat-advice/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Aisling from RTE in Cork contacted a bunch of Irish bloggers about a new show they are doing. I&rsquo;m thrilled she did, considering it&rsquo;s exactly what I recommended only a few weeks ago in the context of my &ldquo;Heat&rdquo; review.
The idea is simple, it&rsquo;s a 6 part competition show called Recipe for Success that will see 15 home cooks battle it out to have their own gastronomic creations stocked on the shelves of SuperValu. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/08/31/think-your-killer-recipe-would-sell-in-a-supermarket/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A brilliant gift of a cookery course in Dunbrody by my fabulous sister-in-law Paula led to one of the best day&rsquo;s out I&rsquo;ve had in ages. Interesting and enjoyable in every way without a dull moment in a gorgeous location.
We did our annual extended family meet-up on the August Bank Holiday weekend in Rosslare recently. On Friday morning I borrowed my mother&rsquo;s car and drove the 45 minute journey to Arthurstown near the ferry in Ballyhack. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/08/11/fun-food-in-arthurstown/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I had written off this series by the third episode but it still showed glimmers of quality. Luckily those glimmers shone through to beat off the bozos and tooth veneers. The final gave us the two best chefs who were clearly passionate and capable.
The food they cooked was fantastic, the mistakes understandable and the emotion strong. My heart was with Ann but I knew in my gut that Paul would clinch it at the end. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/08/10/heat-zaps-the-bugs-and-delivers-a-winning-final/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>8 years after I first registered conoroneill.com, this blog is finally hosted in Ireland where it belongs. Based on all the great feedback I heard about Blacknight and the fact that they are great supporters of the Irish tech startup community, I went with them.
We&rsquo;re on the SOHO package with is just €35 per year ex-VAT and it does everything I need. The move was extremely easy to do. I just copied all the Wordpress files off the old host, copied the Wordpress Database, loaded both up on Blacknight and told GoDaddy that the blog is now there. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/07/31/blog-moved-to-blacknight/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>On June 9th, my uncle Bobby Walls, passed away suddenly. He had been suffering from cardiomyopathy for several years and left us too young at the age of 56.
I probably hadn&rsquo;t seen Bobby since the last funeral I attended in Ratoath. The line about Irish families only meeting at baptisms, weddings and funerals is so true. However, as with all my uncles and aunts, I was incredibly fond of him, having spent many summers in my Granny&rsquo;s house as a kid. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/07/27/bobby-walls-a-life-enjoyed/">&raquo;</a></p>
