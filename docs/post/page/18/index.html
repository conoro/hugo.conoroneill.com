        <p>We decided to head down and look at the poor dead whale in Courtmac this evening. Totally unprepared of course. Hundreds of cars down there, traffic mayhem, tons of people out on the sand taking pictures. Unfortunately we were a bit late with darkness falling and the tide was coming in fast. So only myself and Oisín ran out to grab some quick pictures. We might pop down at a better time tomorrow. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/01/15/sick-as-a-large-whale/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was given this lovely book for Christmas 2007 and finally finished it last month. What initially appears to be a coffee-table resident turned out to be one of the best books on food I&rsquo;ve ever read.
The title says it all. This is a book about pork. Every single bit of the pig gets a mention and use. The author, Stéphane Reynaud is the grandson of a village butcher from the Ardeche plateau in France. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/01/11/pork-sons-review/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again to get your nominations in for the Irish Blog Awards. The ceremony is being held in the lovely Cork International Airport Hotel on February 21.
The number of wonderful Irish blogs increases daily and I can&rsquo;t keep up with the flood of high quality writing out there. There are plenty of categories to nominate in, but you don&rsquo;t have to do all of them.

        <p>The Empire may have done its best to kill the pork industry in Ireland but the producers are fighting back. Barrie Tyner from Slow Food Ireland just let me know that the West Cork and Cork City Conviviums are coming together to bring us &lsquo;The Pig Extravaganza&rsquo;.
I was disappointed to find that this did not include dancing pigs but it&rsquo;s the next best thing :-) To celebrate National Pork Weekend, an evening of eating and great chat is planned down west on Sunday, the 18th of January. <a class="read-more" href="/2009/01/08/return-of-the-porki/">&raquo;</a></p>

 TeenCamp Ireland is a gathering of the techies/bloggers/fanboys age 13+ in Ireland to give talks, meet others, share ideas and have a laugh. TeenCamps are organised/planned/run by teens for other teens. They are holding it in Filmbase in Dublin on Jan 17th.

        <p>Whilst growing up from age 6-18 in Kilkenny, one group of people I never got on with were the park-keepers (&ldquo;parkies&rdquo;) in the Castle Park. They always seemed to be fun-killers.
It looks like nothing has changed in over 20 years. I watched at least 50 people walk away gutted from the park yesterday with bawling children due to this:
One person claimed it was because a child had slipped and hurt themselves on the previous day. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/12/28/frost-stops-play/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>So 47 farms used contaminated pig feed. Unless the FSAI confirms that Gubbeen or Caherbeg are two of those farms, I&rsquo;ll be having a lovely bacon sarnie for my breakfast.
If the State&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer says that dioxin is only dangerous if a person is exposed to it over a long period of time, then why the hell are we destroying millions of Euro worth of food?
We all eat chicken that spends its life sitting in its own faeces in the dark and lots of the pork we eat is dosed up to the eyeballs in sub-therapeutic antibiotics, so how is a slight possibility of a touch of PCB going to make our health any worse? <a class="read-more" href="/2008/12/07/having-some-nice-rashers-for-breakfast/">&raquo;</a></p>
