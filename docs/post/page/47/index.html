Microdrives
You have no idea, none, how much I wanted a microdrive as a teenage geek. I would have happily chopped off my little finger yakuza-style to get one. And this guy, the luckiest man alive, has 8 of them!
And what is it about rose tinted spectacles that I would be happier now to be given a ZX Spectrum +2 with a Kempston joystick than a fully loaded Dell XPS? <a class="read-more" href="/2006/07/14/yes-im-a-sad-old-man-what-of-it/">&raquo;</a></p>

Their upgraded Internet Banking service now supports Firefox/ Mozilla/ IE7/ dunno_what_else. Previously they only supported Internet Explorer with Microsoft&rsquo;s own Java VM and, wait for it, Netscape 4.7!
How embarrassing must it have been to work in web development in that company? I sent them stinky mails about once every six months for the past few years including links to the Microsoft site where the continued use of the MS VM was listed as a no-no. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/07/10/ulster-bank-finally-joins-the-21st-century/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>UPDATE 1: Normally when I do reviews I use the Structured Blogging plug-in. Its biggest flaw is that you can only do one review per post and the &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; below do not warrent separate posts. An alternative is to use the simple hReview creator over at microformats.org and then just cut n past a bunch of reviews into one post. So I have restructured and republished this review in that format (after seeing Tantek do the same). <a class="read-more" href="/2006/07/09/conors-christmas-cookbook-collection/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It took a lot of poking and prodding with the scanner but the consultant finally decided that it is a wee girlie.
Sibéal was thrilled when she finally understood. She initially complained that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a sister, I want a girl&rdquo;. Older lads couldn&rsquo;t give a hoot either way and Fionn was too busy screaming as I was trying to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; him how to use a beaker.

On a completely unrelated topic, Digg has gone to Version 3. Digg is a news site whose top stories are voted into position by the users. Up until now it was mainly tech but they have branched out in V3.
I&rsquo;ve never used it much as it causes total information overload. But the Diggnation Podcast with Alex and Kevin is hysterically funny. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/06/27/all-our-research-gives-us-a-gut-intuition/">&raquo;</a></p>

Now that&rsquo;s just not fair, two phrases in one title to draw the moth into the flame.

I explained to Oisín that this was the starting point in the supply chain for all dairy products. He was suitably impressed.
