        <p>I&rsquo;ve been talking quite a bit recently to Phoebe Bright who is based down in Drinagh. She wears many hats but is incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about energy.
She writes some absolutely brilliant stuff in this area on her blog and I highly recommend you subscribe to it. She is no happy clappy, let&rsquo;s wear hemp shirts and cycle 40 miles to work every day person. The blog talks about fundamental issues around energy supply and managing energy demand. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/07/24/deep-thinking-on-energy-demand-vs-supply/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve done a post over on our business blog about the supports offered to local business by West Cork Enterprise Board. If you are based in the region, it&rsquo;s well worth reading. The highlights are:
 6 hour IT Consultancy for €150 via Tech-Check Feasibility Study Grants up to €5100 International Trade Show Attendance Grants up to €2000 Ecommerce Web-site development Grants up to €1500 That last one is absolutely brilliant. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/07/24/local-business-support/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Now that&rsquo;s a phrase you didn&rsquo;t expect to hear in the current economic climate.
One of the reasons we settled on Bandon when we moved to Cork was the classic location, location, location. It really is ideally situated in Munster for access to almost everything - Cork City, Airport, beaches, businesses, school, sports facilities etc etc.
However, this prime location is missing something critical - somewhere people can meet in a modern business context. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/07/22/opportunity-for-a-property-developer/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The offer of a free box of these sauces was irresistable and we have spent the past few months trying them in a variety of different ways. Whilst our weak-willed Irish palates found the hotter ones just too hot, the depth of flavour is just fantastic. If only they had an Irish distributor!
Back in January I got a comment on a very old post from 2006 that I did about buffalo wings. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/07/10/hot-hot-hot-hot-sauces/">&raquo;</a></p>

I&rsquo;ve eaten in Deasy&rsquo;s once before and thoroughly enjoyed it. For some reason they popped into my head this morning and I hopped into the car with four of the five monsters to see if they were still doing Sunday Lunch. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/29/sitting-on-the-dock-of-the-bay/">&raquo;</a></p>

Whilst the reports on this year&rsquo;s Dublin Event varied, we had a strong belief that Cork would be good simply due to the smaller scale. Auntie Fi babysat the kiddies and we drove in to County Hall for 5. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/28/taste-of-cork-a-huge-success/">&raquo;</a></p>

He wants you to use what you know about iKi beer and Café Mao and tell them which dish on the menu would make the best match for iKi, and why. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/06/27/fancy-a-meal-for-two/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Many of the readers of this blog are surely also fans of The Humble Housewife, Deborah Hadley. She has just launched a fabulous new web-site called Spicendipity selling homemade sauces and 100% natural spice mixes and baking mixes.
Debz had me won over just by saying &ldquo;BBQ sauce&rdquo; when she first revealed what she was putting together.
