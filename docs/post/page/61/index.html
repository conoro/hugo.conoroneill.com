        <p>Congratulations to Myer&rsquo;s Maxol Garage in Mitchelstown. Without doubt the most disgusting, undrinkable excuse for a cup of coffee we have ever bought. I have to wonder if they are using mud in the machine rather than coffeee beans. I&rsquo;ve had some pretty dire coffee over the years. What some Greek cafes did to Nescafe when I was there in 1988 should be banned under the Geneva Convention but they were better than the thing we had yesterday. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/01/30/the-all-time-worst-cup-of-coffee-i-have-ever-tasted/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I just had a comment posted to my old blog by Kim on something I wrote about Bill Hicks back last May. She was stunned that I saw him live about a year before he died and wanted some details. It is odd timing that she posted now considering I&rsquo;m just back from Austin. But I was also thinking about Bill when I was over there.
I was in the airport and spotted some Stevie Ray Vaughan CDs. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/01/24/i-am-the-grim-reaper-for-texas-heroes/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>My old friend and classmate from college Dee Burke read my review of The Four Seasons and sent me her review of La Maison Troisgros in France. I asked if she&rsquo;d mind if I posted it here due to the drooling all over the keyboard that resulted when I read it. She said sure. So, for the first time in the five years this blog has been in existence - a posting from someone other than Mr Creosote: &gt; Peter had heard of &ldquo;La Maison Troisgros&rdquo; for the first time when he did a management course in the IMI years ago. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/01/19/guest-blogger-review-la-maison-troisgros/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We brought the rain with us from Cork and it lashed down as we were driven out to the Salt Lick BBQ which is, as they (and probably Ned Flanders) would put it &ldquo;a heck of a long way out yonder&rdquo;. It is also in a dry county where the sale (but not consumption) of alcohol is illegal.

So we only got a massive SUV instead of a planet-sized one on our arrival in Texas. We&rsquo;re here for the week and I hope I keep my wits about me and take plenty of Nokia Crap-cam pictures.

weariness grew. So we threw caution to the wind, threw the children to
their granny and headed down from Cavan to Capital City for some
pampering and unashamed luxury.
