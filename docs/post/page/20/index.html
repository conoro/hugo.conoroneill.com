        <p>For some reason I completely missed that this was coming. Thanks to Mary Wedel for letting me know. From Fri 26th to Sun 28th September, we&rsquo;re having an Arts Festival in Bandon. Things were actually kicked off on Thursday with the CruX Dance Company in the Town Hall. There will also be an exhibition of local artists in the Miriam Bailey Gallery from Wed 24th.

        <p>Got this from my brother-in-law today:
 If you had purchased £1000 of Northern Rock shares one year ago it would now be worth £4.95, with HBOS, earlier this week your £1000 would have been worth £16.50, £1000 invested in XL Leisure would now be worth less than £5, but if you bought £1000 worth of Tennents Lager one year ago, drank it all, then took the empty cans to an aluminium re-cycling plant, you would get £214. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/09/19/environmentally-friendly-investing/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>SOHO Solo West Cork is the West Cork Chapter of SOHO Solo Ireland, a small business networking and support group. It offers the opportunity to connect with other independent small businesses in the region, to share, collaborate and socialise with people who face similar challenges.
Calvin Jones has recently taken over as organiser and is doing a fantastic job of re-energising it. He is giving a talk on Wednesday called &ldquo;Harnessing the power of social media to help your small business&rdquo;. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/09/15/soho-solo-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>What started off as a throwaway comment on Twitter today led me to one of the most inspirational talks I have seen since Hans Rosling at Le Web.
Sir Ken Robinson talks at TED about how the current education system kills creativity and continues to take the 19th Century approach of generating people trained for industry.
It&rsquo;s 20 minutes long and I encourage you to watch every minute. It isn&rsquo;t just thought provoking, it is also hilarious. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/09/13/creativity-and-education/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to see more and more great Irish food blogs being created and I was recently told about a real cracker.

Ivan McCutcheon, who works as a rural development officer with West Cork LEADER Co-Op and is heavily involved in the the Fuschia Brands initiative, has started Food Culture in West Cork. A must-read as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Check out his great piece on Fishy Fishy and Ummera. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/09/02/food-culture-in-west-cork/">&raquo;</a></p>

The idea is simple, it&rsquo;s a 6 part competition show called Recipe for Success that will see 15 home cooks battle it out to have their own gastronomic creations stocked on the shelves of SuperValu. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/08/31/think-your-killer-recipe-would-sell-in-a-supermarket/">&raquo;</a></p>
