        <p>I've been trying out del.icio.us for a week now and I **still** don't get what the big deal is. Yeah it's handy to have the online bookmarks. The RSS feed is kinda irrelevant for oneself but I suppose if someone was stalking me, they might be interested in what sites I am interested in and what tags I put on them. I take back what I said about tags in my previous Bloglines post below - they are actually handy for finding stuff by category (like GMail). <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/22/delicious/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>No more Princess Bride quotes I'm afraid. Sam entered a world-class poem into a Gerry Ryan Pot Noodle competition today. Unfortunately she was not selected to go on air (unlike her last piece of genius which was up there with T.S. Eliot and she got to read out to the listening public). So, in order to give it the publicity it deserves, here it is in it's entirety. **The Pot heads**   We are from the planet Noodle, We cannot write, we scribble and doodle. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/21/pot-noodle/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We don't have it too bad for restaurants down here in Cork. We've had great meals in Gleesons in Clonakilty, Casino House in Kilbrittain and Broly's in Bandon. Unfortunately most of the places in Bandon target the lower end of the Market and it's nice to see Broly's trying something better. It is a coffee shop/cafe during the day and they re-jig for more upmarket dinner at night. Good tasty food. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/20/life-is-pain-highness-anyone-who-says-differently-is-selling-something/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We are nearly a week into our Sky+ Box ownership. It's not often something far exceeds your expectation but this bloody thing does so with ease. The wee beauty can record two channels at the same time. There is some very impressive buffer management going on in there.

        <p>Finally got around to collecting together the list of other bits of software I use (mainly at home). But first off, I should be given a thorough thrashing for not including XEmacs in the first list. I first encountered XEmacs on HP-UX in Philips Eindhoven in 1995\. Up until then I had used the VAX editor and a few crappy freeware PC ones. This thing was a revelation - syntax highlighting, tons of extensions, call-out to make, gcc, whatever. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/15/there-is-something-you-dont-know-i-am-not-left-handed/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Nostalgia time, 80's fans. Due to unprecedented public demand (currently at zero requests), I am making available my classic ZX Spectrum games at no cost. Each of these 4K masterpieces, which took months of pubescent angst to complete, requires either an actual ZX Spectrum or an emulator to play. My two favourite emulators are [EmuZWin](http://bonanzas.rinet.ru/apps/EmuZWin_Eng.htm) and [ZXSpin](http://www.zxspin.co.uk/). The current version of ZXSpin seems to have some problem finding ROMs so maybe stick with EmuZWin for the moment. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/04/14/you-rush-a-miracle-man-you-get-rotten-miracles/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I keep a "link-blog" over at [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/blog/bandon1). It is just a set of links to other peoples blog postings and sites with stories that caught my eye. I'll put a permanent link to it on this blog when I get a chance. Overall I'm happy with Bloglines but I'm tired of old posts constantly re-appearing as new.
