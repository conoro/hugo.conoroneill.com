&ldquo;It Must be the Music&rdquo; is a night of Musical entertainment in aid of Action Breast Cancer, brought to you by Laoise O&rsquo;Hanlon, joined by a variety of Cork women singers, including Kay Deering, Jamie Harper Kingston, Roos Demol, Bernie Harrington, Sinead Tracey, Jenny Bradley and Molly Lynch. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/10/12/support-action-breast-cancer/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Yesterday I did my first ever Half Marathon in Dingle. Yes it nearly killed me and I had to walk lots of it but I finished and I had several hundred people behind me. Compared to some of my friends who regularly do Triathlons, my achievement is nothing special. But for someone who spent 20 years sedentary and started running in January, aged 41, with a gippy ankle and hugely overweight, I&rsquo;m pretty proud of myself. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/09/05/google-health-android-cardiotrainer-has-me-excited/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was given this heavy tome by the publishers to review and months later I&rsquo;m finally getting my thoughts down. Whilst it is a fantastic collection of recipes and information that all Irish cooks should own, I fear that along with Darina&rsquo;s Forgotten Skills of Cooking, we are looking at our past.

        <p>One of the most powerful blogs I read in recent years was Roos Demol&rsquo;s One Breast Less. I&rsquo;m thrilled she has re-started it and she is involved in an Action Breast Cancer fundraiser.
Please head over there and show your support.
 The concert, which still has no name (ideas welcome) will be held on October 29th in the Brogan Inn in Bandon. At the moment we are practising a barbershop song. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/07/01/support-action-breast-cancer-fundraiser/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Brilliant job by Andrew Kingston of Arkutech.ie in building the newbandon.ie site.

A quick poke around confirmed that it is built on the same fantastic Wordpress foundation as this fine blog.
A certain person named Donncha O&rsquo;Caoimh is one of the main developers of Wordpress and just lives a few miles away in Blarney. Bandon is clearly commited to buying local.
