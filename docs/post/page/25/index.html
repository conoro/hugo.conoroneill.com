        <p>I know a lot of the readers here are foodies and I&rsquo;m sure some of you may even like the odd glass of wine. We&rsquo;ve decided to take part in a regular event called Wine Blogging Wednesday. Event #42 happens this coming Wednesday and the challenge is to review an Italian Red in 7 words. I love a challenge and this is a tough one.
You don&rsquo;t have to be a blogger to take part. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/02/09/can-you-review-a-wine-in-7-words/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We got a voucher from my mother-in-law for The Old Post over a year ago and finally made use of it last weekend. It consisted of one night&rsquo;s stay plus dinner. I&rsquo;ve previously given it top marks in a review last year and had eaten there several times before, all good.
We arrived up about 4pm and they weren&rsquo;t fully open yet but some hand waving got us in and up to the room. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/02/09/review-of-the-old-post-inn-2/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The advertising for this programme had me hating its subject before it had even started. It depicted Dylan McGrath, who runs Mint restaurant in Dublin, as an obnoxious Ramsay-knockoff desperate to win a Michelin star. Two minutes into the show I wanted to turn it off. I had no interest in seeing this pompous, arrogant jumped-up little asshole.
Then the rent-a-critics and old men were put to one side and Dylan was allowed to speak. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/02/04/review-of-the-pressure-cooker-rte/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>After the first travesty of an episode I swore I&rsquo;d never watch another but the lure of Denis Cotter in Bandon was too much. This is Gimmicky Garbage TV with a half decent programme buried somewhere far far underneath.
In the first episode they send Kevin Dundon to cook a gourmet meal in a boxing club in poor area of Waterford. If you thought that was crass, in this one Denis Cotter set up a vegetarian restaurant in the middle of cattle pens in Bandon Mart! <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/29/review-of-guerrilla-gourmet-ep-02/">&raquo;</a></p>

In fact, we are seeing more and more LouderVoice reviews manage this trick. Here is one I did recently: <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/20/top-google-with-the-loudervoice-reviews-competition/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Poacher&rsquo;s Inn is the nearest eatery/pub to our house. In a previous incarnation as Ted Amber&rsquo;s it was an ok pub and a pretty poor restaurant that was barely above the level of a carvery.
The place was bought maybe 18 months ago (or even longer?) and reports have been steadily good. I had a pub lunch there recently and was very impressed so we decided to try the full restaurant last night. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/19/review-of-the-poachers-inn/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This is less of a review and more of a vote of support. Last week Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall kicked off a campaign to get people eating Free Range Chicken. He did this through a series of compelling programmes comparing intensively raised chicken production with Free Range.
Because no-one would let him film in a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; chicken production unit, he was forced to build his own. He split it down the middle with half as free range and half as intensive. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/13/review-of-hughs-chicken-run/">&raquo;</a></p>
