        <p>Burger Blogs seem to be appearing everywhere but this guy [Two-Twenty](http://www.two-twenty.net/archives/000378.html) is an animal! It turns out that Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles restaurant does burgers too. Bourdain became famous because of his book "Kitchen Confidential" which gave the low-down on the high-jinks in a restaurant kitchen. A great read. His "Cook's Tour" follow-up was less hyped but also a very good read. The associated TV series was pretty poor. His " <a class="read-more" href="/2005/06/29/burgertastic/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Aged 22, Patrick died in his sleep last monday night. He was buried at Shanganagh Cemetery yesterday after a heart-breaking funeral mass in Shankill. I didn't know Patrick that well, I met him maybe once or twice a year when visiting Eoin and Jill. But the short life of this young man should be celebrated as a example of achievement in the face of overwhelming adversity. Nine years ago, Patrick was hit by a car and suffered massive head trauma. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/06/25/patrick-kevin-pierce-rip/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The first 3 years of this blog consisted almost entirely of baby announcements for my friends. I guess to be consistent it should also let friends know about those who have passed away. It is obviously a bit clueless to claim that the internet (and blogs in particular) democratises the news but I have to admit that I only buy a newspaper now on Friday, Saturday and Sunday - Friday for the jobs section, Saturday for the food/property section in De Paper and Sunday for the TV bit of the Sunday Times. <a class="read-more" href="/2005/06/25/births-and-deaths/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of the best foodie blogs out there is[ A Hamburger Today](http://www.ahamburgertoday.com/). The writing is top class and the enthusiasm for the food shines through.

There seems to the only three categories here - Mickey D's Style (incl Burger King, Super Macs etc), Chippers (insert your local chipper name here) and diners (Eddie Rockets being the only example I can think of). <a class="read-more" href="/2005/06/25/burger-innovation-in-ireland/">&raquo;</a></p>

I have seen references to Wordpress constantly on blogs and for some reason never checked it out, which is totally out of character for a click-junkie like me.

        <p>Forget 100K for Celebrity Love Island; Oscar finally got the 10 Euro for his first place in Juniors/Seniors writing in the Bandon Show. The following is an exceprt from his winning entry:&ldquo;Pine nut, which is a nut, but it&rsquo;s also the name of a town. Pistachio nut. Red pistachio nut. Natural, all natural white pistachio nut.&rdquo;

This balanced his unfortunate lack of awards at the Crossmahon Sports day yesterday.
