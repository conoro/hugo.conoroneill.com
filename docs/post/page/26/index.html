The fake family scenes recorded during the summer were just ridiculous. But I'm a sucker for punishment and just finished watching an episode of her new series which is all about cooking quickly, a theme which has been done a thousand times. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/09/11/review-of-nigella-express/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Today I am embarassed to be Irish. I wish to extend my apologies and those of all reasonable people in this country to Keola Donaghy and his family.
Keola, who is from Hawaii, arrived earlier today in Dublin with his family to begin his doctoral studies in UCC. He had been assured by the Gardaí in Cork and by UCC that there was no issue with him coming.

The line-up has a very rich mix of styles but the one that caught my eye has to be Eric Bell, the Thin Lizzy founding member who is responsible for the classic Whiskey in the Jar! <a class="read-more" href="/2007/09/07/clonakilty-international-guitarfest/">&raquo;</a></p>

It is a fabulous piece of kit at an incredible knock-down price of €107 plus VAT and P&amp;P. I believe it was over €400 when it was released. It&rsquo;s basically a little hand-held computer with a touch screen that works over Wifi or your mobile connection (via bluetooth). <a class="read-more" href="/2007/08/25/how-to-feel-just-a-bit-stupid/">&raquo;</a></p>
