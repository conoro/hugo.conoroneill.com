        <p>There is a wonderful bunch of things planned in Cork as part of Science Week which will hopefully increase the interest in science amongst kids. The target audience is 10-16 year olds but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll drag our 8 year old along to some of it.
It is on from 11th Nov to 18th Nov in various locations around the city. I believe the HQ is City Hall and local tech companies will have stands there. <a class="read-more" href="/2007/10/27/science-week-in-november/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A friend of a friend is visiting Cork soon and is wondering if any restaurants can assure him that their dishes are nut-free? This person feels that many would use vegetable oil with nut traces when cooking.
It&rsquo;s a tough one I know but any tips would be appreciated.
