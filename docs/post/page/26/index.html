        <p>After the first travesty of an episode I swore I&rsquo;d never watch another but the lure of Denis Cotter in Bandon was too much. This is Gimmicky Garbage TV with a half decent programme buried somewhere far far underneath.
In the first episode they send Kevin Dundon to cook a gourmet meal in a boxing club in poor area of Waterford. If you thought that was crass, in this one Denis Cotter set up a vegetarian restaurant in the middle of cattle pens in Bandon Mart! <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/29/review-of-guerrilla-gourmet-ep-02/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We kicked off a competition recently over on LouderVoice for the most popular review each week. Your reviews can be via SMS, blog or microblog and it looks like the winner in the first week is a two line SMS review. Not only that, but it is the number one result on Google for its subject!
In fact, we are seeing more and more LouderVoice reviews manage this trick. Here is one I did recently: <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/20/top-google-with-the-loudervoice-reviews-competition/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The Poacher&rsquo;s Inn is the nearest eatery/pub to our house. In a previous incarnation as Ted Amber&rsquo;s it was an ok pub and a pretty poor restaurant that was barely above the level of a carvery.
The place was bought maybe 18 months ago (or even longer?) and reports have been steadily good. I had a pub lunch there recently and was very impressed so we decided to try the full restaurant last night. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/19/review-of-the-poachers-inn/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>This is less of a review and more of a vote of support. Last week Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall kicked off a campaign to get people eating Free Range Chicken. He did this through a series of compelling programmes comparing intensively raised chicken production with Free Range.
Because no-one would let him film in a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; chicken production unit, he was forced to build his own. He split it down the middle with half as free range and half as intensive. <a class="read-more" href="/2008/01/13/review-of-hughs-chicken-run/">&raquo;</a></p>
