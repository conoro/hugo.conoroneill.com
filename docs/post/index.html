        <p>I&rsquo;ve been calling Twitter the Hate Machine and LinkedIn a Roach Motel for a long time. But they both really came up trumps with my EI123 blogpost.
Unsurprisingly it turns out that IAG airlines have been treating passengers like garbage all over Europe and they are getting worse by the day. I received a large number of stories both publicly and privately that show a company which seems to detest the people who keep them in business. <a class="read-more" href="/2018/10/30/final-words-and-stats-on-flight-ei123-and-the-death-of-the-aer-lingus-brand/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of my favourite sights in Ireland is when I&rsquo;m driving south on the M8 motorway and the Galtee Mountains appear on the horizon. At certain times of the year and day, it&rsquo;s breathtaking.
The 16yo and I had a fine time out there earlier in the year with Bandon Hillwalking Club on their Open Day but I wanted to find out how much of it was runnable by someone like me. <a class="read-more" href="/2018/10/22/conor-manages-to-get-lost-in-the-galtees-and-only-realises-later/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Buckle up, this is going to be the rantiest rant I&rsquo;ve written in years. It&rsquo;s mostly about getting it off my chest as, based on our experiences over October 5th and 6th, it will have zero effect on the dire state of Aer Lingus.
Let&rsquo;s do the timeline first and then dive into the death of once-well-regarded brand.
An early start but lots of excitement My wife, 5 kids and I woke at 4. <a class="read-more" href="/2018/10/15/flight-ei123-and-the-death-of-the-aer-lingus-brand/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you don&rsquo;t have a Google Cardboard, you can still get some sense of the scale of what Alex Honnold achieved this year when he free soloed El Capitan in Yosemite if you use the 3D controls in YouTube.
Free Soloing is climbing without any equipment or safety ropes. What Alex did is one of the greatest sporting achievements by a human ever.
   &nbsp; &nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve no massive interest in climbing but after watching the Valley Uprising documentary last night (available to buy or watch or Netflix), I have a whole new appreciation for the mindset and philosophy of people like Honnold and John Bachar before him. <a class="read-more" href="/2018/09/29/alex-honnold-free-solo-360-video-mind-blowing-in-google-cardboard/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Kerry Ultra 50K was somehow not on my radar but luckily my wife spotted it recently. We decided to do it barely a week beforehand.
Unlike a lot of ultras over in the UK, this one was all on-road and mostly self-supported. There was a small table every 10K with water and Redbull only.
We went down to Tralee the night before to make the race briefing. Brian O&rsquo;Shea went into huge detail on both the 50K and 100K which weirdly made me more stressed than if I&rsquo;d known nothing. <a class="read-more" href="/2018/09/02/the-kerry-ultra-50k-go-on-sign-up-for-2019/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As a 12 year old kid, the ads for Breaking Glass looked amazing. Somehow I never watched it until tonight.
It hasn&rsquo;t aged well. From the general cheapness to the ropey writing, acting and directing, it should be awful. But it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s lovely. Hazel O&rsquo;Connor, Hazel&rsquo;s songs and Hazel&rsquo;s voice remain utterly unique.
The movie is also a reminder that no matter how bad things are now, they aren&rsquo;t half as bad as the late 70s and early 80s. <a class="read-more" href="/2018/08/31/i-finally-watched-breaking-glass-38-years-later/">&raquo;</a></p>
