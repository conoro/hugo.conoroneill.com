      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having fun mixing up the length and style of the races we&amp;rsquo;ve run this Summer and Autumn. Whilst my speed remains atrocious, I find that my recovery time is getting shorter and shorter, which must be a sign of something. So here goes, June to September:
Cork City Marathon What can I say? It broke me again. I started so well - faster than last year and feeling strong.</description>

      <title>Dear headphone manufacturers - Big opportunity to own the marathon market</title>

      <description>I really wonder about headphone manufacturers and their testing. I own everything from no-name €10 Chinese wired earbuds to €100+ Jaybird X3s and every single one of them is problematic for running.
In the US alone, over 550,000 people ran a marathon in 2016. Scale that globally (with a 13% growth rate) and that&amp;rsquo;s a substantial, defined, receptive, target market.
My goto pair for the past 2 years are SMS In-Ear Wired Sport earbuds.</description>

      <description>I wrote about my first 50k a few weeks back. I still smile every time I think about it. I&amp;rsquo;m already signed up for a 40 miler in the Glen of Aherlow in September (3 loops, so I have a get-out-of-jail) and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to decide what my first 50 miler will be. Suffice to say, I&amp;rsquo;m really getting into this whole trail running thing. And one of the main reasons for that is the brilliant work done by YouTubers, Instagrammers and Podcasters in this area.</description>

      <title>The Chiltern Challenge 50k - Conor&#39;s First Ultra Marathon</title>

      <description>I made this comment on Twitter last week:
Any chance we can narrow &amp;quot;inspirational&amp;quot; to mean &amp;quot;inspired me to action&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;isn&amp;#39;t that a nice story&amp;quot;?
&amp;mdash; Conor O&amp;#39;Neill (@conoro) July 19, 2017 
It was partially driven by the silly overuse of &amp;ldquo;inspirational&amp;rdquo; but also by the fact that I was inspired to run 50km last weekend by all of the amazing Ultrarunners in the US and Europe and the stories they tell via YouTube, Vimeo, Blogs, Twitter, Instagram, magazines and books.</description>

      <description>One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned as I&amp;rsquo;ve dipped my toe into off-road running in Ireland is that we don&amp;rsquo;t really do trails. Apart from forest paths, the bulk of what I&amp;rsquo;ve found is wet muddy bog. This causes me two problems - it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to run in it and American-style trail runners are useless in this environment. My poor Altra Lone Peak 3.0 may as well be slick tyres coming down from Mullaghmesha Mountain.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a post full of superlatives.
When I first heard about Surf Turf n Tar, I was instantly excited. I&amp;rsquo;d done most of the course in chunks already and it&amp;rsquo;s currently my favourite place to run. You have every sort of terrain and views, all in a compact area.
The race started just opposite the Celtic Ross Hotel and headed down a little road. You hear of elite ultra runners &amp;ldquo;blowing-up&amp;rdquo; at 50 miles.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a great one for detailed mile-by-mile race reports so I&amp;rsquo;ve bundled a bunch of them together.
MCI Marathon Ballina We joined the Marathon Club of Ireland last year and I&amp;rsquo;ve been very impressed by the number of events they organise. They have so many amazing athletes who have done 25, 50, 100 and even 200+ marathons.
On the 25th of February, they arranged 3 Marathons in 2 days in Mayo.</description>

      <description>The only thing you need to run is a pair of running shoes. And some people even get by without those. This is regularly driven home to me by the guy in his GAA top/shorts and knackered shoes who laps me in parkRun.
But if you read this blog you&amp;rsquo;re probably a geek like me and of course I&amp;rsquo;m riddled with tech when I go for a lot of my runs.</description>

      <description>On April 3rd I joined nearForm as Chief Product Officer. I genuinely believe nearForm is destined for all-time greatness and I want to contribute to that.
One of my career highlights so far was playing a part in the acquisition of FeedHenry by Red Hat. The day I found out that they were a potential buyer will always stay with me. I have had 2.5 amazing years with them and my opinion has only gone up as time progressed.</description>

      <title>Carrigfadda Hill and Warrenscourt Forest are two brilliant running spots in West Cork</title>

      <description>A few months back I was browsing the Coillte Outdoors site for forests in West Cork that looked good for running in. The two most promising ones I found were Warrenscourt Forest and Carrigfadda Hill.
Warrenscourt I&amp;rsquo;ve done Warrenscourt Forest twice and I highly recommend it. You can access it from either the Warrenscourt end or Kilmurry end and both are very short drives off the N22 near Lissarda. Whilst it&amp;rsquo;s quite steep in places, it&amp;rsquo;s very runnable with some beautiful views along by the stream.</description>

      <description>I only learned of the Irish Mountain Running Assocation (and Munster Mountain Running Association branch) last year. They have an extensive line-up of events all year from hard-core 127km Ultras to family friendly events like today&amp;rsquo;s run in Castlefreke Woods and Long Strand.
And unlike a lot of running related things in recent years, it&amp;rsquo;s an absolute bargain to take part. €10 annual membership and €5 for today&amp;rsquo;s race.
I had no idea what to expect today.</description>

      <description>I talked about parkrun in my monster post last year on the future of Ireland&amp;rsquo;s health. It was started in the UK in 2010 and has spread around the world. In parkrun Ireland there are over 50 events every week. You may have heard it mentioned on Operation Transformation too.
The idea is incredibly simple. Every Saturday at 9.30am, you turn up to your local parkrun and do 5km. You can sprint, run, jog, walk or amble.</description>

      <description>I first learned of the Montane Spine Race last year when there were some mentions online of an Irish guy winning some insanely long race and breaking the record. This turned out to be Eoin Keith who is an amazing ultra runner. He had to pull out this year in third position after breaking a rib near the start. He waited 170 miles to do so :-)

      <description>Four years ago I ran my first marathon, in Dublin, and it was a disaster. Everything seized up at the top of my right calf around mile 10, followed a few miles later by my left calf. I hobbled the remaining 16 miles in pain. It had never happened before and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened since.
I thought that was the end of my marathon &amp;ldquo;career&amp;rdquo; and reverted to Halves and 10k&amp;rsquo;s until last year.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever Googled for video reviews of running shoes, you&amp;rsquo;ve almost definitely landed on a review by The Ginger Runner, Ethan Newberry. For a long time, that was all I knew him for and I bought several pairs after confirming that he liked them. Then I discovered Ginger Runner Live, where he does long interviews with ultra runners live on YouTube. These are my goto podcasts whilst running slowly, along with Bad Boys Running, The Ultra Runner Podcast and Adam Buxton (who may not be a runner :-) ).</description>

      <description>One of my fave things to do is watch videos made by Ultra Marathon runners and videographers. The views are always stunning and instantly make me want to go out for a run. My first attempt to do similar in Run Forest Run was a bit of a disaster as the rain killed my phone.
We&amp;rsquo;ve had an action camera for a few years that my bro-in-law kindly gave us. It&amp;rsquo;s a Contour GPS.</description>

      <description>Our build up to Berlin had not been great. Between holidays, Red Hat Summit in SF, Red Hat Tech Exchange in Vietnam and a week of post-Vietnam illness, I only managed to get a few long runs in. D&amp;rsquo;wife also tripped whilst running, less than a week beforehand, and smashed her face up badly. But we had done the Clonakilty 10 Miler which we both felt went well. So we flew from Dublin the day before without too many nerves.</description>

      <description>Intro I began this post several months ago. It started quite simply - I wanted to congratulate those behind the wonderful Waterford/Deise Greenway and encourage Cork County Council to embrace a West Cork Greenway and execute on it. The Waterford one is partially opening this week.
However the more I thought about it, the bigger the &amp;ldquo;vision&amp;rdquo; got. What I&amp;rsquo;m going to present here is obvious in many places, controversial in others and possibly pure fantasy.</description>

      <description>Finally a book review on the blog. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I heard about this book, probably Twitter, but damn it&amp;rsquo;s a great story. I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of John Lenihan until 3 weeks ago. Then I read this Irish Times article and my jaw was on the floor. He has not only won the Carrauntoohil mountain race 19 times, he still holds the record of 1 hour 11 minutes and 43 seconds.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve done my first trail race, it&amp;rsquo;s time for my initial impressions of the Altra Lone Peak 3.0. Back in June I got a pair of LP 2.5 in Sports Basement in San Francisco. They were supposed to be my first pair of trail runners but I found them so comfy they immediately became my daily shoes. When I went to get another pair in Europe I learned that they were about to be replaced with the 3.</description>

      <description>As you may have read in my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dipping my toe into running off-road. The phrase &amp;ldquo;trail running&amp;rdquo; still seems pretty rare in Ireland where I see &amp;ldquo;mountain running&amp;rdquo; mentioned more often, and &amp;ldquo;fell running&amp;rdquo; in the UK.
Last week my wife spotted on the Running in Cork blog that there was a trail run on in Castlefreke/Rathbarry on Sunday 18th called Run Forest Run. It instantly got me interested as it was [a] nearby and [b] only 5 miles long.</description>

      <description>Shortly after we moved to Bandon, over 10 years ago, I bought a bunch of Ordnance Survey maps of the area and two books by Damien Enright called &amp;ldquo;Walks of Courtmacsherry Bay &amp;amp; The Seven Heads&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Walks in and around Kinsale&amp;rdquo;. We had high hopes of being outdoorsy. To our shame, the most we ever did was to haul the kids along the short track in Kilbrittain woods, the even shorter one in Ballinspittle woods and the tiny bit longer one in Dromillihy woods.</description>

      <description>As has been the case so often over the past 15 years of blogging, I&amp;rsquo;ve been very remiss in my updates. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a ton of things I want to write about, like the Waterford Greenway and how adventure/outdoor tourism could be a much bigger business here. But that&amp;rsquo;s for my holidays.
Today, as I move this blog to Hugo and GitHub Pages (what a journey it has had!), I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just give an update on my running.</description>

      <description>Most people in this country seem happy enough to have it run by imbeciles and criminals, so it’s a relief that some people actually care.
The official web-site which holds the records of the Oireachtas is the kind of incompetent mess that can only have been designed to be that way on purpose. Luckily John Handelaar built KildareStreet.com a few years ago to shine a light on the goings-on in the Dáil and Seanad.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running slowly since 2009. This year has seen two and a half marathons so far, with the Clon Half probably ending the year nicely. But since the very first run I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with audio. I think most people listen to music and I&amp;rsquo;ve done that a bit but I&amp;rsquo;ve spent far more time listening to Podcasts. I listened to Kermode and Mayo on my first Half Marathon in Dingle in 2010 and I listened to them again a few weeks ago in Dingle in the 2015 Half.</description>

      <description>I figured it was either that title or &amp;ldquo;5 ways you can run the London Marathon without even trying&amp;rdquo; ;-)
If you&amp;rsquo;d told me in 2008 that I&amp;rsquo;d ever run a 10k, I&amp;rsquo;d have laughed at you. If you&amp;rsquo;d told me in 2009 that I&amp;rsquo;d ever run a half marathon, I&amp;rsquo;d have laughed at you. If you&amp;rsquo;d told me in 2011 that I&amp;rsquo;d ever run a marathon, I&amp;rsquo;d have laughed at you.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging longer than the average bear, with my first post wayyyy back in 2001 on Blogger. I moved to WordPress in 2005 and did a huge amount of stuff with it both personally and professionally until 2013.
But, like many people, I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with WordPress. Pretty much every WP blog I either ran or had some dealings with, has been hacked. Whether through security-hole-riddled plugins, xmlrpc.php or other bugs in WP.</description>

      <description>Four years ago I wrote a quick throwaway post about TB hospitals in Ireland. For whatever reason it bubbles up very close to the top of any google search on that topic. As a result, I have set of comments there which just have to be read. All of them are interesting, many are heartbreaking. The majority are written by people who were either in such a hospital or had a relation in one.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, I know. I spent most of 2013 focused on my tech blog over here. But I thought I&amp;rsquo;d kick off 2014 with a foodie post.
I use a lot of hot sauce but tend to be very boring in the ones I buy, mainly sticking to the supermarket reliables like Tabasco and Encona. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the odd Irish one too but many of them seem obsessed with heat and not flavour (Rebel Chilli being the worst culprit here).</description>

      <description>For a good few years, this blog was all about food. I had lots of restaurant reviews and foodie pics and experiments like making sausages. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much in that area for a long time. Whilst I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten lots of lovely food since then, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much that was truly memorable. Until Friday night.
My parents were down for a visit and we planned to go to The Poacher&amp;rsquo;s Inn with them and big sis, but when we went to book we were told the Tapas night was starting at 8pm and it was only a very limited menu before that.</description>

      <description>Brian Greene contacted me last week about a new project he has just launched called Tuairisc.me. Like many good ideas, it&amp;rsquo;s brilliantly simple. It&amp;rsquo;s an anti-bullying form for school web-sites that can be added with a single line of HTML to any site.

I sent some questions/thoughts over to Brian and his responses convinced me that this thing has legs. But it will only work if as many people as possible know about it.</description>

      <description>We recently did a short family outing to the forest in Castlefreke just before the kids went back to school. Whilst the walk itself was fun and short enough to avoid the kids complaining too much, it brought up a ton of questions and ideas in my head, such as:
 Why is it so hard to find detailed information about walks/trails in West Cork and the rest of the country?</description>

      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have a quick peek at my running stats this morning. Last year was pretty good and I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to start 2013 a whole 6 lbs lighter than I started 2012. Having said that, lots and lots of weight to be lost this year.
I started &amp;ldquo;running&amp;rdquo; back in 2009. It was not an auspicious beginning.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to see Cork CoCo finally putting an Alerts system in place. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to use. You simply go to the relevant Map Alerts site and register there with your mobile/email/etc. You can also add your home and work locations for alerts.

Right now they are doing Alerts for Met Eireann Severe Weather Warnings in all of the County and for Flood Warnings in Clonakilty. I assume they&amp;rsquo;ll eventually integrate Bandon FEWS in too rather than running two separate systems.</description>

      <description>Bandon Coder Dojo kicked off this year and they have just made the move to St Brogans school at the top of the town. It&amp;rsquo;s on every Tuesday from 6:30pm to 8pm.
They are currently focused on Scratch, HTML and JavaScript. If you have any skills in those areas, they would really appreciate more mentors taking part.
Our eldest has just started using Scratch and is finding it good fun. Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot:</description>

      <description>My two favourite products working together to make me run like the wind (cough).
When I switched from running in Bikilas to these TrekSports, I started getting a sore spot just behind the ball of my left foot. It appears to be due to a seam on the VFFs rubbing me. Using a temporary pad worked during the week so now I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this Sugru fix will be permanent. I have to run 5 miles tonight so that should prove it one way or another.</description>

      <description>Timoleague was formerly a place of some note, being much resorted to by the Spaniards, who imported large quantities of wine here and it is said there were formerly no less than fourteen taverns that sold sack in the town. Looking at the wide slob lands when the tide is out, or the shallow waters at full tide, it is hard to believe that here was once a busy Medieval port where foreign merchants from France and Spain bartered their wines and Mediterranean produce for Irish butter, hides and farm produce In Timoleague&amp;rsquo;s case, the harbour silted up through no fault of the town.</description>

In March 2011, after doing 2 Half Marathons and a 10k, I was close to giving up on running. Every time I got on a treadmill in my ASICs, I got crippling shin-splints within minutes. It was like trying to run with two solid wooden peg legs. Running on grass was only slightly better.
18 months prior to that I had also destroyed my ankle by going over sideways on it twice in quick succession.</description>

      <description>Hard to believe I started this in mid-Jan and we are just about to bounce into May.
Plenty of activity in the past month, some good, some bad. Variety and texture remain problematic but overall, sticking to veggie and fairly vegan for the past few weeks.
Some product updates to share. First, the good ones:
 Sojade - A bifidus soya yoghurt-alternative. This is a shocker. Smells and pretty much tastes like natural yoghurt.</description>

      <description>It all kicked off in mid-Jan and here we are on April 1st, still at it. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a huge number of updates since the last one in February but a couple of interesting tidbits, including one which just happened and threw me completely.
Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s still entirely vegetarian except for the Friday chicken curry and I&amp;rsquo;m be strongly tempted to replace that with something veggie soon due to a great Indian Veggie book my sister got me.</description>

Quick, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;ll be gone by April 2nd.

      <description>For the past few years I have been buying a variety of pharmacy products from drugstore.com in the US. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, they&amp;rsquo;re part of Amazon, not some dodgy crowd flogging fake horse tranquillizers.
There are two reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this. The first is that I use a miracle stomach drug called Omeprazole which solved over 20 years of chronic stomach problems when I finally discovered it (and other PPIs like Nexium).</description>

      <description>So we&amp;rsquo;re what, maybe 4 weeks into the experiment? Overall it&amp;rsquo;s going great apart from the giant hole in the ozone layer that my methane is creating ;-)
I&amp;rsquo;m still picking at the odd bit of ham/turkey and I&amp;rsquo;m still doing the Friday Chicken Curry but apart from that, it is all veggie. If I removed the milk from my tea I&amp;rsquo;d basically be vegan. But that ain&amp;rsquo;t happening.

      <description>A few months back I mentioned Coder Dojo which now covers the country and has recently gone international. It&amp;rsquo;s a free programming club where kids go with their parents and learn about things like web development, mobile development, games programming or other types of coding. The Cork City one is jammers every week from what I hear.
I was thrilled to see that Kinsale has kicked one off too and they had 103 kids at their first one.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I had coffee with Haydn in Urru, Bandon and we spent a good while talking about food and health. He mentioned a book called The China Study which made a very strong scientific case for a plant based diet as a way of dealing with many ailments including heart disease.
As I have been officially obese for the past few years, I was in my regular new year weight loss mode and wanted to do it in a healthy way.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote about our switch away from Sky and on to Freesat and Saorview using the Ariva 120 Combo box. After initial success I can no longer recommend that box to anyone. It crashes constantly, it loses channels and its recording features are worse than agricultural. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that it must be faulty it&amp;rsquo;s that bad, so I&amp;rsquo;m returning for repair and will report back.</description>

Despite Tubbs excruciating interviewing style, Sean O&amp;rsquo;Sullivan blew my socks off. From a family of 9 with a dead-beat Dad to huge success. He runs his current business, Avego, from Kinsale. We need more people like him talking about Engineering and Creativity together. If you want your children to create the future, nudge them in that direction.</description>

Thanks again to Gordon for doing all the actual work whilst I basked in the glory :-) It was even better considering how sick I am with a nasty tummy bug. The bug means I can do little useful work for the past few days. But I can play with code.
One fantastic outcome from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s blogpost was John Handelaar and others pointing out that I&amp;rsquo;d given up too easily on trying to extract the river level data from the Bandon FEWS web-site.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the Bandon FEWS system which sends an SMS when the river at the bridge hits a certain level. It must be a life-saver for many businesses and people in the town.

I have had a few thoughts on other things we could do with that live river-level data for the community. Web-apps, Twitter integration, Analytics, Trends etc etc.
However, despite several communications, I have been unable to get any response from Cork County Council about getting access to the live data.</description>

      <description>Over on my tech blog recently, I mentioned dumping Sky TV and getting an Ariva 120 box. This is a combination satellite and digital terrestrial receiver. It costs an amazing €99 and you never have to pay another thing. You disconnect your Sky box, plug the satellite lead and aerial lead into the Ariva and you&amp;rsquo;re done.
Until yesterday I had only used the satellite bit which gives you BBC etc.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I missed this when it was announced recently. A superb initiative from Cork County Council. They have put aside €300,000 to help with provision of enterprise centres / hot desk facilities in County Towns. This will include a contribution of up to €35,000 for tech and hot desk provision.
The downside is that is doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover building rental but surely some joined-up thinker in the Council is already working on a deal with NAMA to get properties for rental at 10c on the Euro or less?</description>

      <description>Well done to Gavin Sheridan and the crew at The Story. They took NAMA&amp;rsquo;s pathetic PDF release of the properties it owns, extracted the data into the fantastic Google Fusion Tables and then mapped the results into Google Maps.

Go on, you know you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to help yourself. I immediately zoomed into Bandon to see what was there. Surprisingly few properties actually.
Head on over to the site and click on any dot of interest to see what property it is.</description>

      <description>Ireland has more than enough Corporate Lawyers, Audit Accountants, Bankers and Civil Servants. What it needs are creative people building products, services and businesses. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean every kid in Ireland should be doing Science or Engineering but lord, would more of you please do those subjects.
The internet is one place where we see a wonderful synthesis of creativity in design and engineering. I believe you can teach anyone the basics of web development to a level where they can contribute in some way to web applications and mobile applications.</description>

      <description>After the pork recall debacle, you&amp;rsquo;d thing the FSAI would get a bit of cop-on but obviously they need to keep inventing make-work to keep themselves in jobs. Their latest wheeze is to try and ban Raw Milk. Not bleach-cleaned chicken nuggets or mechanically recovered meat burgers or sausages with 53% &amp;ldquo;meat&amp;rdquo;. No, they want to ban a product that some people actively seek out and choose to drink.
I&amp;rsquo;m really really getting sick and tired of this bullshit.</description>

More than 63 businesses have signed up to offer deals and there is also the chance to enter Bandon’s Lucky Dip and win one of six vouchers worth €200, redeemable in any member business.</description>

      <description>It has always struck me as ridiculous that the only place in all of West Cork where you can get a short-term Hot-Desk is in Macroom. We&amp;rsquo;re not that far from it but it&amp;rsquo;s still a horrible drive from Bandon.
We continue to struggle as a small Internet business with 6 Mbs ADSL (512kbs up). If we were slightly closer to the exchange we might get 12Mbs. Those responsible for allowing Fibre connectivity to bypass Bandon have ensured that there will never be a technology cluster in the town.</description>

      <description>Hard to believe. Little did I think, this day 10 years ago, that I&amp;rsquo;d still be blogging away like fury. I originally started with Blogspot as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t keeping my Geocities home page up to date. It was not an auspicious start:

And didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly take off like a rocket with only 3 posts in 2001!

2005 was the year I really got going when I moved from Blogspot to Wordpress.</description>

      <description>I was very disappointed to miss the inaugural Bandon 10k last year so there is no way I&amp;rsquo;m missing the first Bandon Half Marathon on May 14th.

My type of running is known, by experts in the field, as walking :-) Last year I did the Courtmacsherry 10k, the Dingle Half-Marathon and the Galway Bay Half-Marathon. All done incredibly slowly and all tough. My dodgy ankle did not help.</description>

      <description>This is for people interested in Cork South West election coverage/results.
Love it or hate it, if you want absolutely up-to-date information on the General Election over the next few days then you have to be on Twitter. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, for most of it you don&amp;rsquo;t have to setup an account.
So the main feeds you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be interested in are:

      <description>I love the mock election thing they are running over on boards.ie. Basically you can input your voting preferences for your constituency and see what the patterns are like already. Cork South West has only had 142 votes so far and it&amp;rsquo;d be great to see more to get a better sample set. It would be also good to get as wide a demographic as possible voting rather than the usual boards.</description>

      <description>Just got a mail from Ruth in Urru, Bandon. They have come up with a great idea called bonanza days. It kicks off with all kitchenware half price on Fri 29th/Sat 30th! I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be popping in for that.
Future bonanzas will include €1 coffee days, Free Urru Cotton Shopping Bags , Massive Savings on Wines, Cookery Books, Farmhouse Cheeses, Easter Eggs, Lucky Dips and more.
Mmmm, latte.
I love seeing Urru making a mockery of the long-held belief that you can&amp;rsquo;t do gourmet in Bandon.</description>

      <description>EatMagazine launches today. There will be 20,000 free print copies per month in Dublin initially. It is also available free online.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty stunned that the first issue was all put together by one guy, Mikey Maguire. It&amp;rsquo;s a really impressive piece of work and makes a mockery of much of the so-called professional rubbish you see on newsagents shelves.
Well worth a read.

      <description>Like most people in the country I&amp;rsquo;m pretty depressed about where Ireland has ended up. And I don&amp;rsquo;t see an election, which replaces one set of Peter Principle County Councillors with another set, helping in any way. Politics in Ireland is completely broken and I&amp;rsquo;m finding myself in a situation where I don&amp;rsquo;t want to vote if all it does is elect more of the same.

The bulk of the population remains to be convinced of its utility so my usual answer to people wondering why they should join is that it&amp;rsquo;s the ultimate news source.</description>

Yes it nearly killed me and I had to walk lots of it but I finished and I had several hundred people behind me. Compared to some of my friends who regularly do Triathlons, my achievement is nothing special. But for someone who spent 20 years sedentary and started running in January, aged 41, with a gippy ankle and hugely overweight, I&#39;m pretty proud of myself.</description>

A quick poke around confirmed that it is built on the same fantastic Wordpress foundation as this fine blog.
A certain person named Donncha O&amp;rsquo;Caoimh is one of the main developers of Wordpress and just lives a few miles away in Blarney. Bandon is clearly commited to buying local. OK Wordpress is free but you get my point!</description>

      <description>I was thrilled to get an email from Tara O&amp;rsquo;Donoghue to tell me that Bandon allotments are up and running.
The allotment garden is located in Cloughmacsimon – a short distance off the bypass, right behind Coláiste Na Toirbhirte.
Plots are available in 2 sizes 5x7m for €80pa or 5x10m for €100pa. There are plenty of plots available so call 023 8852922 or 087 9567452 or email bandontransition@gmail.com for more information.</description>

      <description>With a single episode, the greatest TV show RTE have made about food in at least 25 years. Martin Shanahan jumps out of the screen, grabs you by the scruff of the neck and demands that you watch him and start loving fish.
After decades of dreary formulaic yawn inducing food programmes on Irish TV or worse, the &amp;ldquo;crayzzzzze kooky&amp;rdquo; shows, someone in RTE finally saw an episode of Jamie Oliver and realised what was missing - personality.</description>

      <description>We recently discovered this shop as it seems to be the only one in a few hundred miles of Bandon that sells Sodastream gas refills. Catherine popped down a few weeks ago to get two refills and raved about the place. I drove down yesterday to have a look and get some of the Sodastream flavours.
They are just at the top of town on the main street, impossible to miss.</description>

      <description>I popped into the fish shop in Bantry today and spotted these. A fully sealed pack of live local mussels. I have long lamented the lack of fresh shellfish in shops in Cork and now they have no excuse. All you need is a cooler cabinet with no need for special shellfish expertise or having to deal with smells or things going off. These could literally be sold in every garage and convenience shop in the country.</description>

      <description>The cold seemed to reduce the numbers quite a bit this year but still a great display by the locals. Fire engines and tractors still firm favourites in our house with the Steam Tractor being my own personal highlight·

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it short and sweet. If you know of any family-friendly comedians or mind-trick guys who would be able to perform on March 26th in Bandon, can you get in touch with me and I&amp;rsquo;ll pass it on to the Rosmini Centre people? They do have some budget for it, so pro or semi-pro is fine.
Also the dog owned by one of the kids who was going to perform has gone missing.</description>

      <description>Every year the great people who run the Rosmini centre for adults with an intellectual disability organise a fun and interesting event to promote community integration and inclusion for everyone. This year they are organising a community variety show.
It&amp;rsquo;s on Friday the 26th of March in the GAA Hall in Bandon. Doors opening at 7.15, show starts at 8 sharp. It is not a fund raising event so tickets will be at the very affordable cost of €5 each.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to put Masterchef out to pasture. I&amp;rsquo;m watching an average show in about 10 minutes using Sky+. The formula isn&amp;rsquo;t working any more. No tension, no excitement, the same stupid catchphrases. Cooking doesn&amp;rsquo;t get any harder than this. Yeah, it does.
Scallops. If I see one more bleedin scallop on that show, I&amp;rsquo;ll explode. Fabio Viviani, in the far superior US show Top Chef, described the same problem perfectly back in January 2009:</description>

      <description>I know the whole Twitter thing is still completely alien to a lot of people. How many wondered what the hell the papers were on about when discussing Dan Boyle&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;tweet&amp;rdquo;?
Here&amp;rsquo;s a suggestion for dipping your toe in and getting a handle on it all. Karwig Wines in Carrigaline is running the third &amp;ldquo;Twebt&amp;rdquo; which is a Twitter wine-tasting competition (Bubble Brothers and Curious Wines ran the first two).</description>

      <description>I know the tech stuff annoys the foodie readers here and vice versa. So last week I started up a new Posterous blog over on conoroneill.net. It is much more high volume than this blog and consists mainly of pointers to interesting tech stuff, opinions thereof and the odd funny bit. So basically pretty much anything except food/Bandon, which will remain here.
I&amp;rsquo;ll do the odd cross-reference when it makes sense.</description>

      <description>The idea of relentlessly banging on about weight and fitness here and on Twitter didn&amp;rsquo;t really work. There are only two people that I follow on Twitter doing it and one of them is my sister. But I have been marking major milestones and today was one of them.
So from Dec 29th to Feb 9th, I have lost 20 pounds.
How? No booze, no snacking, no sweets, normal breakfast, normal lunch, smaller dinner, fruit whenever I&amp;rsquo;m peckish and a small amount of treadmill Mon-Fri.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of Neven. Anyone who can run a successful restaurant in the middle of nowhere in rural Cavan gets my vote. His energy is always fantastic too. This new show is ok but nothing amazing.
I&amp;rsquo;m surprised to see cookery programmes still being made that refer to &amp;ldquo;dinner parties&amp;rdquo;. Does anyone still have those?
His three dishes in the opening episode were asparagus and smoked salmon tartlet, confit duck and a tiramsu variant.</description>

#1 - The first rule of Fat Club is, you must talk all the time about Fat Club online.
#2 - The second rule of Fat Club is, you MUST TALK about Fat Club online.</description>

      <description>Well Bandon Film Society has gone and done it again with this brilliant idea.
In association with Partnership for Change they are organising a Special Christmas Charity Screening for Bandon Flood Appeal on Wednesday 30th December 2009 in St Peters Church, Bandon at 8pm
The movie is one of my top 5 of all time, The Princess Bride, starring the angelic Robin Wright.

I have ordered the Zappos Culture book he mentioned (just email ceo@zappos.com and they&amp;rsquo;ll post you a copy) and downloaded the Tribal Leadership audiobook from here (use California 90210 for your address in the registration screen). Wonderful stuff.

      <description>Our thoughts are with all those families and businesses damaged by the horrendous floods in West Cork this week.
We were lucky. Apart from the inconvenience of no phoneline and some bad leaks in a bay window, we managed to escape pretty unscathed.
If you have any detour tips for those trying to get in and out of West Cork, please leave them in the comments. This route was still working at 2pm yesterday so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll work for you.</description>

Can I suggest a Cork Computer History Museum?
What&amp;rsquo;s one of the biggest attractions in Silicon Valley? The Computer History Museum
What&amp;rsquo;s one of the biggest tourist draws in London? The Science Museum.

I&amp;rsquo;m not going to say much, I&amp;rsquo;ll let all the videos I took do the talking. Suffice to say that €15 to sample over 100 fantastic wines plus cheese from On The Pigs Back, bread from Arbutus and amazing smoked Duck, Salmon and Chicken from Ummera is an absolute steal.</description>

      <description>Two days of fantastic fish recipes by a wonderful teacher in a perfect setting. Not much more to say than that. But I will.
Three years ago I did a cookery course down in Good Things Cafe with Carmel Somers. It was honestly two of the best food days I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. The relentless pressure of start-up business life meant I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to return until this month. Now I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go again.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always happy to see local initiatives get an online presence to extend their reach. My attempt to create a blog for Bandon Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market three years ago fell flat due to my lack of consultation with the standholders to ensure buy-in. So it is great to see the new site launch with all the details you need. Check it out here and don&amp;rsquo;t forget it is on every Saturday morning.</description>

      <description>Trevor and crew have done a big revamp of the bandon.ie. Tons of useful information about the town and area and the beginnings of a local business directory. You should definitely be subscribed to the blog if you want the latest news. I push all their blog updates to Twitter here too.
The best way you can help the site is to make sure you let them know about everything that is happening in the town.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried their meat yet but the thought of locally-reared organic pork has me salivating. They sell directly to the consumer and are based in Teadies near Enniskean. The pigs are a mix of Old Spots Gloucester &amp;amp; Saddleback. Give Liam a call on 086 604 1208 if you want to order. More details on their web-site.

      <description>Just watch him take apart this Panorama interviewer. It&amp;rsquo;ll be impossible for me to take the show on the BBC tonight seriously.

He is not only hysterically funny but completely accurate too. Flying Ryanair is simple, you make yourself aware of the rules and work within them. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever paid more than €60 for a Ryanair return flight. Treat it as a bus, set your expectations correctly and you&amp;rsquo;ll find them the perfect short-haul operator.</description>

      <description>The recent review of CX Oriental by Messy Chef was the final push I needed to check this place out today after months of saying I must. It&amp;rsquo;s just fantastic. If you have ever raved about Asia Market in Dublin, this is 10x better.
If you have driven past Kinsale Road Roundabout in the past few months you can&amp;rsquo;t have missed the huge signs for CX Oriental Cash and Carry. Whilst Cork has had the brilliant Mr Bell&amp;rsquo;s in The English Market for years, it suffers from lack of space and the awkwardness of getting to it so this morning I finally made the trip to the Cash and Carry.</description>

      <description>We were recently taken out to dinner by my parents and decided to try the Malt House Granary in Clonakilty. We had only been once before, 5 years ago, and had not liked the heavy food. Buta recent review which highlighted the new ownership made us want to try again. And oh boy were we glad we did.
We like eating very early and sat down at 7.30 to a totally empty restaurant which had me worried.</description>

      <description>The second year of the Engage Arts festival is fast approaching and it looks fantastic. Something for everyone, no matter what their interests or age.

I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a simple mini-blog for the event over here on Posterous. The aim is that people can upload information, pictures, videos etc very easily over the weekend.It has the full line-up for the two days and contact details too.
It&amp;rsquo;d be fantastic if you&amp;rsquo;d take part in this exercise.</description>

      <description>Catherine FitzMaurice from Kilbrogan House just contacted me about an awesome night that is happening as part of the Engage Arts festival over the weekend of Sep 25th.
They are showing the 1925 version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with, and this is the genius bit, live organ accompaniment by Dr Eric Sweeney who is head of Music at Waterford School of Technology. Not only that, but they are showing it in a church.</description>

      <description>Margaret Jordan pointed out on Friday in Facebook that the 1911 Census data is now online. Ever since, a bunch of us have been searching and learning. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking up O&amp;rsquo;Neill, ONeill, Neill, Flynn, Meaney, Foley, Doran, Wall and Walls to see which of my ancestors I could identify and send them on to my Mum and Dad.
I was thrilled to find this record of my Granny Mary, her parents and siblings.</description>

      <description>The stats around Facebook in Ireland are staggering, they are racing towards 1 millions active users here. That just blows my mind. Some are predicting they&amp;rsquo;ll have more pageviews globally than Google by next year!
Whilst I initially didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time for it, coming from the open blogging world, bit by bit its value for me has grown. Even at the simplest level, it is the only site where many people I know from school and college ever congregate online.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been said by many others too but Twitter is seriously denting my blogging. Why write an entire post when most of the time 140 chars will do?
But what will be remembered and found in years to come? Watching Chris Moyles on &amp;ldquo;Who Do You Think You Are?&amp;rdquo; really drove home the importance of historical records. My mother ran into a brick wall with her genealogy research a few years ago once she got into the 19th Century.</description>

In a time of crisis when men/women of vision and ability need to quickly agree a strategy and execute it with confidence, Brian Cowen assembles 28 people (plus the heads of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and representatives from the departments of Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Finance).</description>

      <description>Deeply important piece by Ivan on food security and our future. Don&amp;rsquo;t just read it, leave your thoughts too.
The ability of a country to feed itself and have a sustainable agri-business must surely have been a major motivator of Reddy Brennan and his team in Avonmore in the early 1970s. A man of great vision with incredible negotiation skills, he is one of the heroes of Irish industry. Our family will always be grateful to him.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t bear to read the report. It sickens me to think what those evil scum covered up over the years.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a religious person but I take some comfort in imagining everyone involved in the systematic abuse of children in the 20th century burning in the eternal fires of hell.
Some comfort in imagining every priest, every brother, every nun, every bishop, every arch-bishop, every cardinal, every papal nuncio, every pope who knew anything about what was happening in this country and DID NOTHING, being raped by satan every day for eternity.</description>

      <description>Those of us who are watching much less broadcast TV and more time-shifted or downloaded programmes are starting to become very uncomfortable with the monthly Sky tax just to get some intermittent BBC2/Ch4 etc.
Media companies everywhere try to stop piracy and block those outside of their borders from watching programming online on sites like Hulu. This is a battle they cannot win.
The problem they have at the moment is licensing.</description>

My lovely parents were down in Cork for the weekend for the GAA thingy and offered to bring Catherine and me out for a meal. We&amp;rsquo;d heard great things about Fenn&amp;rsquo;s Quay from my sister and Julian Alubaidy and, wanting somewhere new to us, booked it.</description>

Now you can be informed.

What John Handelaar has done over at kildarestreet.com with the help of some other great people is deeply important. Quite simply, the Dáil record is now properly accessible rather than just available. The site enables you to do the following:
 Read a dramatically-more-legible version of the Dáil Record going back to January 2004 Search that record by speeches or written questions, or by speaker, or by date or date range Sign up for email alerts for when a search query you&amp;rsquo;re interested changes Sign up for email alerts whenever a TD of your choosing says something or asks a question which generated a written reply Subscribe to RSS feeds for individual TDs or for search queries This isn&amp;rsquo;t just important for the content you find but also for the content that you don&amp;rsquo;t find.</description>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an economist to know that media companies are suffering hugely in this recession. Their reliance on advertising makes them incredibly sensitive to downturns.
When you have a radio show that addresses a focused engaged specific audience, you would think that it would be a gift both for the broadcaster and those advertising to that audience. Thus C103&amp;rsquo;s decision to axe David Young&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;West Cork Today&amp;rdquo; programme frankly boggles the mind.</description>

So when I hear that someone who lives just up the road from me is now making craft and organic breads and they are selling them at the Bandon Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market every Saturday, well that make me very very happy.
Check out the alphaomega blog for a list of their current products. I&amp;rsquo;ll be checking out the bread.</description>

      <description>The &amp;lsquo;Bandon - Working Together&amp;rsquo; group seeks to promote the strengths of the town through communication and activities. Their first activity is the creation of a &amp;lsquo;What&amp;rsquo;s on in Bandon&amp;rsquo; newsletter. If you want to get a mention in it, head on over to the Bandon.ie blog for all the details.
I&amp;rsquo;m shooting them a quick email now about doing a blog and email list.</description>

      <description>I was enraged on Thursday whilst listening to the latest Restaurant Guys&amp;rsquo; podcast. They were interviewing a New York restaurateur who is being picketed by fois gras protestors. These ugg-boot-wearing idiots think they can intimidate a small business owner and effectively put him out of business. These cowards don&amp;rsquo;t have the balls to go after large fast-food chains who sell industrially produced chicken and figure they&amp;rsquo;ll go for easy marks instead.</description>

      <title>Peter Schiff and why we&#39;ll remain screwed</title>

      <description>Many of you have seen this video on YouTube where investment expert Peter Schiff is shown many times on US TV in 2006-2007 explaining why the US was in a property bubble and why it was all going to collapse. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it, it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious and depressing at the same time.

I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to know much about investing but when we were moving from Dublin to Cork in 2003 and saw that our house had increased in value more than 400% in 9 years, we took the money and ran.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve just had the third annual waste of time known as Earth Hour where millions of people worldwide pretend to do something useful about global warming and turn off lights for an hour. For 99.999999% of those people, that&amp;rsquo;ll be it for another 365 days. End result for the Earth, big fat zero. Perhaps if we take all the energy expended by the media covering this story, we may even have a net negative?</description>

      <description>(In the immortal words of Bill Hicks). Just got an email to tell me that the West Cork Literary Festival will run from July 5th to 11th. Now I&amp;rsquo;m not the most literary person in the world. My last three books were &amp;ldquo;Presenting to Win&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Bad Science&amp;rdquo; and something by Harlan Coben. Next up is &amp;ldquo;On the Origin of Species&amp;rdquo;. But even I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of some of the heavy-hitters who&amp;rsquo;ll be attending the festival.</description>

      <description>Fianna Fail may be able to censor RTE and turn it into a toothless Soviet-era Pravda but luckily we have the internet to enable democracy and freedom of speech and expression.
Here is the original RTE piece on the Cowen nudes that they removed from their site and then apologised for mentioning. Thanks to Mr Mulley.
&amp;ldquo;Against us are&amp;hellip; all timid men who prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty&amp;hellip; We are likely to preserve the liberty we have obtained only by unremitting labors and perils.</description>

      <description>If you had never heard of Twitter before, the relentless coverage of it on RTE and elsewhere recently must surely have changed that. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple system for messaging people who follow you but in a completely public way. You can pick whose messages you see by default too. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick snapshot of those I follow: One of the nice aspects of Twitter is that it leads to real-world interactions too.</description>

      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t good food, it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic food. The Irish have forgotten the power of preserving and this is a big wake-up call. Lip-smackingly gorgeous duck confit that is an absolute bargain and a doddle to prepare.
Disclosure: I received several of these products for free and did not pay delivery.
Quite a while back Laurent of Confit de France contacted me and a bunch of other foodie bloggers about his new ecommerce store which was selling a variety of preserved French foods including confit, pate, rillettes and foie gras.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you bought a USB stick or portable harddisk with the best intentions in the world but how often do you actually backup irreplaceable files? How would you feel if those wedding pictures disappeared in a puff of smoke?
That&amp;rsquo;s why I consider online backup a must-have. I only recommend two services and the one at the top of my list is PutPlace. This low-cost solution by an Irish company is simple to set-up and then you just forget about it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying it non-stop for two years; if your business is not online, you are heading for extinction. I don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you are a butcher, baker or artist, start selling online now. Too difficult or pricey? Check out these guys or these guys.
But more than &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; business, the move of media online is accelerating all the time. Traditional newspapers across the US are going bust and the Voice group in Ireland couldn&amp;rsquo;t get traction.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned Twitter many times on this blog. Bit by bit, it is going mainstream. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to hang out online (or on your phone via SMS or mobile web) with people you like and who can fit their thoughts into 140 chars.
But Twitter has a ton of practical uses too, one of which is saving money. My buddies in Nooked have created a ryanair_ork account there which publishes some great special offers regularly on Ryanair flights from Cork.</description>

      <description>I made a quick mention of the old TB hospitals in a blog post about BCG almost two years ago. As far as I know there were lots of them. Peamount, which we drove past many times, opened in 1912 and there was also Cappagh and others.
I just got a lovely email from someone who was in such a hospital in the 1950s wondering if I&amp;rsquo;d got any feedback. Unfortunately I hadn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>We decided to head down and look at the poor dead whale in Courtmac this evening. Totally unprepared of course. Hundreds of cars down there, traffic mayhem, tons of people out on the sand taking pictures. Unfortunately we were a bit late with darkness falling and the tide was coming in fast. So only myself and Oisín ran out to grab some quick pictures. We might pop down at a better time tomorrow.</description>

      <description>I was given this lovely book for Christmas 2007 and finally finished it last month. What initially appears to be a coffee-table resident turned out to be one of the best books on food I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.
The title says it all. This is a book about pork. Every single bit of the pig gets a mention and use. The author, Stéphane Reynaud is the grandson of a village butcher from the Ardeche plateau in France.</description>

I was disappointed to find that this did not include dancing pigs but it&amp;rsquo;s the next best thing :-) To celebrate National Pork Weekend, an evening of eating and great chat is planned down west on Sunday, the 18th of January.</description>

      <description>Bloody teenagers. All they do is sit around, playing video games, smoking, drinking cider and coming up with fantastic ideas like TeenCamp. &amp;gt; TeenCamp Ireland is a gathering of the techies/bloggers/fanboys age 13+ in Ireland to give talks, meet others, share ideas and have a laugh. TeenCamps are organised/planned/run by teens for other teens. They are holding it in Filmbase in Dublin on Jan 17th.
If you know anyone in this age group who fits the bill, let them know about it.</description>

      <description>Whilst growing up from age 6-18 in Kilkenny, one group of people I never got on with were the park-keepers (&amp;ldquo;parkies&amp;rdquo;) in the Castle Park. They always seemed to be fun-killers.
It looks like nothing has changed in over 20 years. I watched at least 50 people walk away gutted from the park yesterday with bawling children due to this:
One person claimed it was because a child had slipped and hurt themselves on the previous day.</description>

Any politician who votes in favour of Annaghmore is basically admitting to being a shill and will be out on their ear in the next election.</description>

      <description>So 47 farms used contaminated pig feed. Unless the FSAI confirms that Gubbeen or Caherbeg are two of those farms, I&amp;rsquo;ll be having a lovely bacon sarnie for my breakfast.
If the State&amp;rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer says that dioxin is only dangerous if a person is exposed to it over a long period of time, then why the hell are we destroying millions of Euro worth of food?
We all eat chicken that spends its life sitting in its own faeces in the dark and lots of the pork we eat is dosed up to the eyeballs in sub-therapeutic antibiotics, so how is a slight possibility of a touch of PCB going to make our health any worse?</description>

It is the retail/warehouse outlet of newly launched Curious Wines. Mike Kane, the owner, has put together a brilliant selection of wines which are not your usual supermarket generic stuff.
Their web-site has just gone live and it&amp;rsquo;s a corker (boom! boom!). Another stunning creation by the shockingly talented Ms Dent.</description>

      <description>When the Irish Blog Awards nominations open early next year, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Ivan McCutcheon&amp;rsquo;s recent post about local West Cork abbatoirs and butchers will be the one I pick.
If you care about the food you put in your gob and appreciate the work of people with a passion for their craft, read Ivan&amp;rsquo;s piece, print it off and give it to those you know.
For so many reasons, it is imperative that businesses like Dan Maloney&amp;rsquo;s in Bandon survive and thrive.</description>

      <description>I have no excuse for the lack of posting here other than the usual busy-ness of life. I&amp;rsquo;ll get back into writing mode very soon. Lots of blogposts and book reviews in my head, I just need to get them out through my fingers.
Speaking of reviews, I hope my loyal readers don&amp;rsquo;t mind me doing a very quick bit of blatant promotion of LouderVoice. We have just kicked off our 2008 BES offering.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just had an absolutely perfect seafood lunch in Fishy Fishy with my parents. Incredible fresh seafood at reasonable prices with attentive staff. The only downside was an excess of ladies-who-lunch trying-too-hard.
I have never ever heard a bad word about the original Fishy Fishy. Everything about it sounded great except the small number of tables which resulted in long waits. As we are usually with-childer, that&amp;rsquo;s not an option. My parents popped down for a visit and brought me out for lunch today to their new location looking out on the harbour.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of very good reviews of Mio on LouderVoice and finally got a chance to try it out last Sunday. A brilliant meal in a beautiful but shockingly empty restaurant. We&amp;rsquo;ll be back soon.
Granny Mary shooed us out the door at 5pm on Sunday and we tootled down to Clon to Mio&amp;rsquo;s. Owned by the same people as the brilliant Gleenson&amp;rsquo;s, it is two doors up and upstairs.</description>

      <description>For some reason I completely missed that this was coming. Thanks to Mary Wedel for letting me know. From Fri 26th to Sun 28th September, we&amp;rsquo;re having an Arts Festival in Bandon. Things were actually kicked off on Thursday with the CruX Dance Company in the Town Hall. There will also be an exhibition of local artists in the Miriam Bailey Gallery from Wed 24th.

All details over on the blog. &amp;gt; This coming Thursday, 25th September, Emilio Saez van Eerd of Casa de las Vides and Javier Navarro from Tintoralba (earlier tasting summarized in this post) will be making a flying visit to us, and I’d like to give them and their wines as much publicity as possible.</description>

      <description>Got this from my brother-in-law today: &amp;gt; If you had purchased £1000 of Northern Rock shares one year ago it would now be worth £4.95, with HBOS, earlier this week your £1000 would have been worth £16.50, £1000 invested in XL Leisure would now be worth less than £5, but if you bought £1000 worth of Tennents Lager one year ago, drank it all, then took the empty cans to an aluminium re-cycling plant, you would get £214.</description>

      <description>SOHO Solo West Cork is the West Cork Chapter of SOHO Solo Ireland, a small business networking and support group. It offers the opportunity to connect with other independent small businesses in the region, to share, collaborate and socialise with people who face similar challenges.
Calvin Jones has recently taken over as organiser and is doing a fantastic job of re-energising it. He is giving a talk on Wednesday called &amp;ldquo;Harnessing the power of social media to help your small business&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>What started off as a throwaway comment on Twitter today led me to one of the most inspirational talks I have seen since Hans Rosling at Le Web.
Sir Ken Robinson talks at TED about how the current education system kills creativity and continues to take the 19th Century approach of generating people trained for industry.
It&amp;rsquo;s 20 minutes long and I encourage you to watch every minute. It isn&amp;rsquo;t just thought provoking, it is also hilarious.</description>

      <description>The new Vista ad from Microsoft. I think it&amp;rsquo;s an all-time great. Brilliant writing (by Seinfeld I assume). Not once is Vista mentioned, just the logo at the end.
When you get tired of &amp;ldquo;buy buy buy, buy this, NOW, do it now, limited time offer, for you, blah blah blah&amp;rdquo;, then funny oddball ads like this put a smile on your face. I swear my opinion of Vista has gone up since I&amp;rsquo;ve watched this.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to see more and more great Irish food blogs being created and I was recently told about a real cracker.

Ivan McCutcheon, who works as a rural development officer with West Cork LEADER Co-Op and is heavily involved in the the Fuschia Brands initiative, has started Food Culture in West Cork. A must-read as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. Check out his great piece on Fishy Fishy and Ummera.</description>

      <description>That has to be the strangest blogpost title I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used.
We arrived back from our much-needed and many-years-delayed holiday to France yesterday (long blog post to follow soon on that). A few hours later Catherine picked up a j-cloth in the kitchen sink to find&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;a bat!
It was absolutely tiny, barely bigger than my thumb and we had no idea what to do with it. I gently picked it up with a cloth (are they disease carriers?</description>

      <description>Aisling from RTE in Cork contacted a bunch of Irish bloggers about a new show they are doing. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled she did, considering it&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I recommended only a few weeks ago in the context of my &amp;ldquo;Heat&amp;rdquo; review.
The idea is simple, it&amp;rsquo;s a 6 part competition show called Recipe for Success that will see 15 home cooks battle it out to have their own gastronomic creations stocked on the shelves of SuperValu.</description>

      <description>A brilliant gift of a cookery course in Dunbrody by my fabulous sister-in-law Paula led to one of the best day&amp;rsquo;s out I&amp;rsquo;ve had in ages. Interesting and enjoyable in every way without a dull moment in a gorgeous location.
We did our annual extended family meet-up on the August Bank Holiday weekend in Rosslare recently. On Friday morning I borrowed my mother&amp;rsquo;s car and drove the 45 minute journey to Arthurstown near the ferry in Ballyhack.</description>

      <description>I had written off this series by the third episode but it still showed glimmers of quality. Luckily those glimmers shone through to beat off the bozos and tooth veneers. The final gave us the two best chefs who were clearly passionate and capable.
The food they cooked was fantastic, the mistakes understandable and the emotion strong. My heart was with Ann but I knew in my gut that Paul would clinch it at the end.</description>

      <description>8 years after I first registered conoroneill.com, this blog is finally hosted in Ireland where it belongs. Based on all the great feedback I heard about Blacknight and the fact that they are great supporters of the Irish tech startup community, I went with them.
We&amp;rsquo;re on the SOHO package with is just €35 per year ex-VAT and it does everything I need. The move was extremely easy to do. I just copied all the Wordpress files off the old host, copied the Wordpress Database, loaded both up on Blacknight and told GoDaddy that the blog is now there.</description>

      <description>On June 9th, my uncle Bobby Walls, passed away suddenly. He had been suffering from cardiomyopathy for several years and left us too young at the age of 56.
I probably hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen Bobby since the last funeral I attended in Ratoath. The line about Irish families only meeting at baptisms, weddings and funerals is so true. However, as with all my uncles and aunts, I was incredibly fond of him, having spent many summers in my Granny&amp;rsquo;s house as a kid.</description>

She writes some absolutely brilliant stuff in this area on her blog and I highly recommend you subscribe to it. She is no happy clappy, let&amp;rsquo;s wear hemp shirts and cycle 40 miles to work every day person. The blog talks about fundamental issues around energy supply and managing energy demand.</description>

 6 hour IT Consultancy for €150 via Tech-Check Feasibility Study Grants up to €5100 International Trade Show Attendance Grants up to €2000 Ecommerce Web-site development Grants up to €1500 That last one is absolutely brilliant.</description>

      <description>Now that&amp;rsquo;s a phrase you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to hear in the current economic climate.
One of the reasons we settled on Bandon when we moved to Cork was the classic location, location, location. It really is ideally situated in Munster for access to almost everything - Cork City, Airport, beaches, businesses, school, sports facilities etc etc.
However, this prime location is missing something critical - somewhere people can meet in a modern business context.</description>

      <description>The offer of a free box of these sauces was irresistable and we have spent the past few months trying them in a variety of different ways. Whilst our weak-willed Irish palates found the hotter ones just too hot, the depth of flavour is just fantastic. If only they had an Irish distributor!

      <description>Denise Cox has let me know that a new Film Society is being organised in Bandon. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any of the details yet but if you are interested, fire an SMS over to Declan Waugh at 086-3853363. I&amp;rsquo;ll post an update when I hear more.</description>

      <description>I got an email during the week from Mary Wedel who runs the brilliant An Tobairín Health Food Shop in Bandon. We&amp;rsquo;ve watched Mary grow this business since we arrived here from a pokey place on North Main Street to the bigger one on Factory Lane to the current flagship on South Main Street. I see no reason why she won&amp;rsquo;t be as successful as Whole Foods Market in the US.</description>

      <description>A last minute decision to pop down here for Sunday lunch turned out to be a total success. Fantastic seafood in a relaxed atmosphere with serene views of Clonakilty Bay. If they could just do something about parking, it would be perfect.
I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten in Deasy&amp;rsquo;s once before and thoroughly enjoyed it. For some reason they popped into my head this morning and I hopped into the car with four of the five monsters to see if they were still doing Sunday Lunch.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to this for months and it did not disappoint. An overwhelming success for the organisers and the exhibitors. We had a fantastic few hours last night, sampling and chatting. Go!
Whilst the reports on this year&amp;rsquo;s Dublin Event varied, we had a strong belief that Cork would be good simply due to the smaller scale. Auntie Fi babysat the kiddies and we drove in to County Hall for 5.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know a lot about wine and beer, but I know a man who does. Julian over at Bubble Brothers has a nice competition on their blog. They import the gorgeous Japanese iKi beer (I had it in Wagamama a few months back) and are now supplying it to the Cafe Mao chain.
He wants you to use what you know about iKi beer and Café Mao and tell them which dish on the menu would make the best match for iKi, and why.</description>

Debz had me won over just by saying &amp;ldquo;BBQ sauce&amp;rdquo; when she first revealed what she was putting together. We love the idea so much, the prize we are giving away on LouderVoice for the best review at Taste of Cork is one of her BBQ Hampers.</description>

      <description>I did a last-minute race down to The Fish Shop in Union Hall this morning to check it out. It&amp;rsquo;s as good as they say! Great selection of fish, shellfish, gourmet seafood products and wine. Well worth travelling to.
So my lazy ass didn&amp;rsquo;t get up early enough and I left Bandon at 12 knowing they shut at 1pm on a Saturday. I made it to Union Hall by 12:45 after spending the journey as far as Rosscarbery behind someone who averaged 35 MPH.</description>

      <description>So if food lovers are foodies and wine lovers are winos ;-) I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that fish lovers are fishies. Just got a comment on an old blog post about the fish shop in Union Hall and it&amp;rsquo;s all good news: &amp;gt; we Glenmar Shellfish have now merged with Antcar over 12mths ago - if you are ever in Union Hall again be sure and call into the shop again - The Fish Shop - you will not be disappointed - we have recently extended the shop and added alot of additional products to our impressive array of fish - including mussels !</description>

      <description>It looks like Taste of Dublin this weekend was a big success and a huge improvement over last year. I was thrilled to hear that they are doing a Taste of Cork from Friday 27th June to Sunday 29th. Over on LouderVoice, we&amp;rsquo;d like to capture the quality of the event by having people review what they eat/drink/encounter by SMS. The most popular review will win a prize (suggestions on what that should be are very welcome).</description>

      <description>Christine and Dermot Gannon have created a flawless hideaway experience in the Tipperary countryside. Our short one night stay turned out to be one of my most enjoyable travel experiences ever.
My lovely mother-in-law Mary got myself and Catherine a night away in The Old Convent as a present last Christmas. It came very highly recommended by her sister-in-law Marie whose standards are very high. We headed off from Bandon mid-afternoon on a Friday and arrived little more than an hour later in Clogheen.</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much seen every TV programme that Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has made. The quality/interest has varied over the years but I&amp;rsquo;m really digging (pun intended) this new series.
The show has the same premise as things like Jamie at Home where the focus is on growing and cooking seasonally. Obviously this is all about Spring and early summer and the first episode focused on lettuce, spinach etc.
You won&amp;rsquo;t see a huge number of recipes but you will see different approaches to vegetables and produce so that they go centre stage.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s actually a project involving Clonakilty Macra and other local community groups to to highlight the plight of the Asian Elephant. I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a trip down for sure.</description>

      <description>Thrilled to find a nice new local place with good tasty well-priced unpretentious food which I think will suit our family perfectly. I&amp;rsquo;ve also heard good things from several others.
Italistro opened several months ago and immediately caught my eye because, despite being on a street I rarely visit, they advertised on the side of the building in their lovely brand colours and I see it every time I go through town.</description>

      <description>An unsatisfying mix of excellent food and wine with haphazard service and crazy pricing. The most expensive meal we&amp;rsquo;re ever had but sadly not the best.
Regular readers of the blog know that I was blown away by the documentary on Dylan McGrath getting his Michelin star for Mint. When my parents gave me a 40th birthday present of a meal for two there, I was gobsmacked and couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to go.</description>

You can be damn sure this either results in me calling a premium rate number or they&amp;rsquo;ll just need get my bank details from me.

Most of your old faves are there, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been playing the ever-brilliant Jet Set Willy. I love just clicking around and being reminded of many happy hours as a teenager in the 80&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve gone down for a look a couple of times over the years and it is genuinely a very exciting event. Noise, burning rubber, unburnt fuel and fabulous bikes. My kids think it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic and hopefully the baby won&amp;rsquo;t screech this time.
Now if only the rain would hold off so we don&amp;rsquo;t have any accidents.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve lost track of the number of times I&amp;rsquo;ve said we must pop in for a look. The closest we got was some of the kids taking the road-train around Clon with their Granny last year.</description>

      <description>The bandon.ie blog has an important post about the Action Plan for the improvement of Bandon town centre. They have full details on what it&amp;rsquo;s all about but the critical bit is having your say. Let the consultants who are drawing up the proposals know what you think should be done to improve the town. Some off the top of my head are:
 Finish the bypass (I know I know, this isn&amp;rsquo;t in their remit) Improved street lighting, particularly on bypass Extended footpaths on all major routes out of town Changing junction priorities Traffic lights at top of Glasslyn Removal of some right turns in the town Better bus stops Encouraging the owners of all the land on Glasslyn to develop it Encouraging a new commercial indoor play area Presenting Bandon as a great location for hi-tech biz.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re just playing around with a few ideas on a site called Jaiku this morning (they were bought by Google a few months back). The idea is that you can have discussion channels on particular topics like technology, politics, Bandon GAA, whatever. What makes it (and other great sites like Twitter) so powerful is that you can interact with it entirely through SMS on your phone.
So this morning I created two non-techie ones that I thought might appeal to my more foodie readers.</description>

Are there any sites that provide some sort of service in Ireland for this?</description>

      <description>I know there are tons of small businesses out there struggling with IT, even basics like anti-virus and e-mail. Unfortunately, lack of knowledge can often mean you aren&amp;rsquo;t even aware that there are better and cheaper ways of doing what you are doing.
Last Autumn, the County Enterprise Boards launched Tech-Check to address this widespread problem. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple but highly effective initiative to help businesses sort out their most pressing technology problems.</description>

I was a bit surprised how short it was and the person beside me mentioned the lack of music. Face painting and balloon shapes went down very well. I wish I&amp;rsquo;d managed to see all the old cars as the pristine Escort (Mexico?</description>

      <description>I meant to write this post a few months back and was finally reminded to yesterday when I was in Cork Airport yet again.
The old airport carparks had the most unreliable equipment on the planet, pure third world garbage. I spent more time stuck in queues trying to get out of there due to malfunctioning barriers than any other airport, including Dublin which I have used more.
So you&amp;rsquo;d think, when spending €180m on a new airport (and hoping we taxpayers will stump up the money for it), that they&amp;rsquo;d find a supplier of equipment that, ye know, actually works.</description>

      <description>As someone who grew up in Kilkenny from the age of 6-18, I was very excited to see that Creative Camp is on this weekend. Not only that, but it&amp;rsquo;s on in the wonderful Kilkenny Castle where I spent many a day trying to find secret tunnels as a kid.
If you are wondering what it is all about, the idea is that the attendees are the presenters. It is in the BarCamp tradition of &amp;ldquo;unconferences&amp;rdquo; where the agenda for the day is very much made up on the day.</description>

      <description>Mike Newham has updated us on Car Sharing in Cork: &amp;gt; We&amp;rsquo;re pushing out the introduction in Cork till July the 4th because of the massive VRT changes that occur on that date. We&amp;rsquo;ll start off with eight cars on the road - 3 Ford Focuses (Foci?), 4 Ford Fiestas and 1 Transit Connect for delivery&amp;rsquo;s and the like. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; All will be low emission diesels with extra safety options and lots of helpful gizmos like bluetooth and sat-nav.</description>

      <description>John Prendergast from Aonach just let me know about a competition a friend of his is running. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty damned impressive: Glengarriff Lodge near Bantry in West Cork is giving away a Luxury Self Catering  weekend worth €1175 to one lucky blogger who mentions it! The location looks gorgeous and the Lodge is interesting because the aim was to be both luxurious and eco-friendly/sustainable.
The concept might be of interest to Irish Bloggers who have a deep interest in sustainability like Tom Atkins or Rebecca Hillman.</description>

      <description>This is an unusual book made up of a collection of 18 discourses on individual ingredients which were originally distributed as a newsletter. It was first published in 1992 and I was given this 2004 edition by my sister.

Initial impressions of the book are extremely positive; the writing is of very high quality and the opening treatise on salt catches the imagination. From then on however it seems to alternate between wonderfully interesting chapters and workmanlike almost Wikipedia-style dry listing of facts about certain foods.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take part in a regular event called Wine Blogging Wednesday. Event #42 happens this coming Wednesday and the challenge is to review an Italian Red in 7 words. I love a challenge and this is a tough one.

      <description>We got a voucher from my mother-in-law for The Old Post over a year ago and finally made use of it last weekend. It consisted of one night&amp;rsquo;s stay plus dinner. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously given it top marks in a review last year and had eaten there several times before, all good.
We arrived up about 4pm and they weren&amp;rsquo;t fully open yet but some hand waving got us in and up to the room.</description>

      <description>The advertising for this programme had me hating its subject before it had even started. It depicted Dylan McGrath, who runs Mint restaurant in Dublin, as an obnoxious Ramsay-knockoff desperate to win a Michelin star. Two minutes into the show I wanted to turn it off. I had no interest in seeing this pompous, arrogant jumped-up little asshole.
Then the rent-a-critics and old men were put to one side and Dylan was allowed to speak.</description>

      <description>After the first travesty of an episode I swore I&amp;rsquo;d never watch another but the lure of Denis Cotter in Bandon was too much. This is Gimmicky Garbage TV with a half decent programme buried somewhere far far underneath.
In the first episode they send Kevin Dundon to cook a gourmet meal in a boxing club in poor area of Waterford. If you thought that was crass, in this one Denis Cotter set up a vegetarian restaurant in the middle of cattle pens in Bandon Mart!</description>

Your reviews can be via SMS, blog or microblog and it looks like the winner in the first week is a two line SMS review. Not only that, but it is the number one result on Google for its subject!
In fact, we are seeing more and more LouderVoice reviews manage this trick. Here is one I did recently:</description>

      <description>The Poacher&amp;rsquo;s Inn is the nearest eatery/pub to our house. In a previous incarnation as Ted Amber&amp;rsquo;s it was an ok pub and a pretty poor restaurant that was barely above the level of a carvery.
The place was bought maybe 18 months ago (or even longer?) and reports have been steadily good. I had a pub lunch there recently and was very impressed so we decided to try the full restaurant last night.</description>

      <description>This is less of a review and more of a vote of support. Last week Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall kicked off a campaign to get people eating Free Range Chicken. He did this through a series of compelling programmes comparing intensively raised chicken production with Free Range.
Because no-one would let him film in a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; chicken production unit, he was forced to build his own. He split it down the middle with half as free range and half as intensive.</description>

      <description>We all know to expect snooty service in Paris but I&amp;rsquo;ve rarely found that and have enjoyed most meals that I&amp;rsquo;ve had there. So I was a bit gobsmacked by the Jean Marie Le Pen supporters running Buddha Bar in Paris.
The &amp;ldquo;evening&amp;rdquo; unfolded like this.
 We&amp;rsquo;re at Le Web 3 conference in Paris and we want to get some food. We also want to do so near the NetVibes party later on Rue de Rivoli Tariq Krim says that it isn&amp;rsquo;t a good area for food but Buddha Bar is ok.</description>

      <description>Michael Newham just left a comment on my post about car-sharing. It looks like this is going to happen next year. It&amp;rsquo;s a great idea.
 Our company ‘Mendes - GoCar’ will be providing the car-sharing service in Cork City Centre. We hope to have it operational by May the 1st 2008.
Please see the Wikipedia article for a good overview of what Car-Sharing is about.
All our ‘GoCars’ will have dedicated parking spaces ‘GoBases’ near high residential and business nodes of population.</description>

This cretin who clearly rates his own life as worthless carried out a suicidal overtaking manouvre of my car just before Bandon with a stream of cars bearing down on us. If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen him in my side mirror and swerved into the road margin at the last second, there would have been a fatal three car collision.</description>

I had to drive up to Dublin recently (having become over-used to the train) and stopped at Midway on the N7/N8 interchange to grab something to eat. I had spotted a newish place in there the last time I&amp;rsquo;d stopped for coffee and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try.</description>

      <description>How many people are going to plump for the jesusphone in their posts? If Steve Jobs is responsible,it must be magic. Except it&amp;rsquo;s not, it&amp;rsquo;s a very nice UI on a phone design that was out of date in 2006 in Europe. So if not a fashion accessory then what? I think the Science Week people really mean &amp;ldquo;new product&amp;rdquo; when they say &amp;ldquo;invention&amp;rdquo;, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to go a read some science journals to find the latest cure for cancer.</description>

That was as far as I ever got on the Beara peninsula until last week when I visited Adrigole. I honestly can&amp;rsquo;t put into words how beautiful it is down there. If I was American I&amp;rsquo;d call it God&amp;rsquo;s country. Perfect views on a perfect day made me want to immediately retire and move there.</description>

 1990: Learned it existed when I started Masters in UCD 1991: Figured out email, Usenet news, Gopher. Discovered ftp.funet.fi and the world of shareware 1992: First job in S3. Email only. Figured out ftpmail to download programs overnight on 14.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Science Week question is &amp;ldquo;What invention do you want to see most in the future&amp;rdquo;. This is an easy one to describe but it&amp;rsquo;ll be a long time coming. I want to see an inexpensive non-invasive home medical diagnostic machine that can detect and diagnose a wide range of problems on its own and via a data-feed to the relevant medical experts.
The benefits of such a machine could be enormous</description>

      <description>Looks like the Science Week guys are hardcore! They&amp;rsquo;ve hired Edelman to help with PR. I like the idea they came up with. Basically Irish Bloggers have to answer some stuff about their favourite inventions as blog posts during the coming week and we might win a Wii.
Today&amp;rsquo;s question is &amp;ldquo;What was the favourite invention from your childhood&amp;rdquo;.
This is an easy one. The home computer, specifically the Sinclair ZX Spectrum.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t normally mention posts that I write on blognation over here but I think this one is probably of great interest to many of my local readers and those in more rural locations in Ireland and the UK.
A company called 3G Doctor in Kerry provides a service whereby you can get a video consultantion with a qualified doctor using your 3G phone.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written all about it here. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to hear what you think and whether the 3G coverage is good enough yet so that it is useful to the people who need it most.</description>

      <description>There is a wonderful bunch of things planned in Cork as part of Science Week which will hopefully increase the interest in science amongst kids. The target audience is 10-16 year olds but I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;ll drag our 8 year old along to some of it.
It is on from 11th Nov to 18th Nov in various locations around the city. I believe the HQ is City Hall and local tech companies will have stands there.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a tough one I know but any tips would be appreciated. If you run a restaurant and are willing to make the assertion, even on a sub-set of your dishes, feel free to comment here.</description>

It is a site that watches for any blog posts that mention a TD&amp;rsquo;s name and provides a summary of that post on the site. It is party neutral and is in no way partisan.
Those with blogs can add a widget which displays the latest politics posts on their own blog sidebar.</description>

There will be a half hour programme about our recent trip roughing it in Nepal whilst attempting to assist a women’s cooperative – you’ll get a flavour of my truly amazing negotiation skills and Cul’s cooking under pressure!</description>

Keola, who is from Hawaii, arrived earlier today in Dublin with his family to begin his doctoral studies in UCC. He had been assured by the Gardaí in Cork and by UCC that there was no issue with him coming. He has spent months preparing for this move.</description>

It is a fabulous piece of kit at an incredible knock-down price of €107 plus VAT and P&amp;amp;P. I believe it was over €400 when it was released. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a little hand-held computer with a touch screen that works over Wifi or your mobile connection (via bluetooth).</description>

      <description>Clonakilty Black Pudding is rightly famous and many people were saddened by the passing of Edward Twomey who made it into a formidable brand. Over the years they have diversified a bit and I see their sausages almost everywhere. We&amp;rsquo;ve tended to buy them as our &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; saturday sausage when supermerket buying (going more with Caherbeg or Gubbeen for a treat).
This morning I spotted an extra sticker on the pack and initially had to giggle &amp;ldquo;This product does not contain Colour Red 2g (E128)&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;It contains Colour (Carmine E120)&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>My &amp;ldquo;stick it in the ground and it&amp;rsquo;ll grow&amp;rdquo; school of gardening thought has failed miserably this year. The only things that have grown are non-essential herbs, apples, strawberries, sorrel and radishes. And I don&amp;rsquo;t even particularly like the latter two. Actually, I nearly forgot the one rhubarb plant which provided seven metric tonnes of sticks. Lots of yummy tarts for me (as the bishop&amp;hellip;.).
So I got thick the other day and ripped up almost everything.</description>

I treasure my &amp;ldquo;Are you the farmer&amp;rdquo; t-shirt (only Withnail fans get it!) and my &amp;ldquo;People&amp;rsquo;s Front of Judea&amp;rdquo; one. Not only are they funny, the quality of the tees is excellent.</description>

      <description>I gave a talk today about blogging to the West Cork Soho Solo Networking Meeting in Clonakilty. I previous gave the same one to the East Cork group. It was very well received and I hope we see a few new blogs coming from them. If you are not aware of Soho Solo, it is a very worthwhile project. As their site says:
 The aims of the project are to identify Small Office Home Office Workers(Soho Solos) in the South West of Ireland, to encourage others to relocate or return to the region, to promote Small Office Home Office Working and to offer support to these &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; entrepreneurs.</description>

      <description>Just got a mail from old college buddy Niamh Shaw. She has taken the oft-travelled path of Degree in Engineering, PhD in Engineering, Gaiety School of Acting, Fair City, comedy troupe and is now part of the Craic Pack in Dublin.
They&amp;rsquo;ve been doing comedy improv every Wed &amp;amp; Friday in The Bankers Bar, Trinity St in Dublin for a long time and they&amp;rsquo;ve just announced that on Saturday, July 28th, they’re going to do an ever bigger and funnier show in the Mill Theatre, in Dundrum Shopping Centre.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re playing around with some stuff on LouderVoice and we need as many translations as possible for the word &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo; in the sense of &amp;ldquo;a review of a movie&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;a review of a restaurant&amp;rdquo;.
Ideally it should be a generic word that works in most situations. It would also be better if the words did not have accented characters (I&amp;rsquo;ll explain that in a later post) and they must be in latin alphabet.</description>

 There will be a number of small artisan producers displaying, tasting and selling their products. There will also be several organisations and companies who are involved in matters of a sustainable nature, solar panels, wetland construction, vermicomposting, permaculture, wind and hydro power.
 Well worth a trip down to a beautiful location and a fabulous building.</description>

      <description>My good buddy Damien had some harsh accurate words to say recently about City Jet Handling (previously known as Sky Handling Partners). It now appears to someone in that organisation has been using Damien&amp;rsquo;s details to sign up to gay dating sites. He has not received a satisfactory response from them and wonders what to do next. I think a Solicitor&amp;rsquo;s letter should be the first step. Anyone else?</description>

      <description>Then LouderTweets are for you.
After a few late nights we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to let you send reviews from Twitter to LouderVoice. We&amp;rsquo;re calling them LouderTweets and they are 140 character mini-reviews you can send using Web, SMS or IM via Twitter to LouderVoice.
So far we&amp;rsquo;ve had reviews of chocolate, couscous, a conference, a lawnmower and many others. Make your Tweets Louder!
An important point is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a LouderVoice member to send LouderTweets but you should join if you want to rate, bookmark and build/share useful collections of reviews and mini-reviews.</description>

      <description>So after a small amount of fiddling I have put together a simple system to allow people to report problems like water/gas/electricity outages and maybe car crashes and road blockages in Cork (other suggestions welcome).
This is by the residents and for the residents of the region.
Updates are always visible to everyone at The Cork Problems Page.
If you want to send reports then the setup will take you maybe two minutes.</description>

The basic idea behind the book is that there are identifiable conditions and actions which cause something to become wildly popular or successful - things that become epidemics (in the wider sense of the word).</description>

I would encourage Cork CoCo to immediately fire the arsehole at the end of the &amp;ldquo;All other emergencies&amp;rdquo; phone line listed in the Green Pages. My wife rang this cretin at 6am to report the water problem and find out what was wrong.</description>

Fionn will love the animals, Sibéal will screech at the dogs and the eldest boys will demand ice-cream from the second they arrive.
I&amp;rsquo;ll take more pictures of huge cows which impress me every time. Hope to catch some show-jumping too.
Head towards Clon, turn right for Dunmanway/Recycling facility, right again about half a mile down and you hit it after another mile or two.</description>

      <description>The scandal that is the non-vaccination using BCG of children in Cork could have far-reaching implications for the health of many people under the age of 30. Both employees of the then Southern Health Board and the political appointees to the board may have had a say in implementing this negligent policy and continuing to allow it to occur since the 1970&amp;rsquo;s. It is clear that the health of Cork children is considered less important than that of children from elsewhere in the country.</description>

      <description>If you are not a geek, stop reading now. Factory Joe (aka Chris Messina) did a Tweet earlier pointing to a theme for Wordpress. I just checked it out. I am so in awe of this person.
It is a Commodore 64 Command Line Interface to a blog.
Try typing last, next, current, help or cat
Someone somewhere please please do a ZX Spectrum version of this.
UPDATE 1: Ach, just realised Chris must have seen it on Boing Boing.</description>

      <description>Courtesy of Jonathan Hill. Get your county into the top spot in Monopoly! It looks like the entire population of Leitrim and Roscommon has voted with 296 and 258 votes respectively. Cork floundering with 31 and Kilkenny with 26.

Note to Hasbro - maybe get a custom PollDaddy widget created that we could all put on our blogs? It&amp;rsquo;s viral baby!</description>

      <description>If you are one of my many non-technical readers you may have heard me and others mention things like RSS and words like &amp;ldquo;subscribe&amp;rdquo; and you may have wondered what it is all about. Well the lovely people over at The Common Craft Show have put together a great 3.5 minute video called &amp;ldquo;RSS in Plain English&amp;rdquo; which explains it all. If you check more than one or two sites/blogs per day to see if they have any updates then you need to watch this video and save yourself hassle.</description>

I&#39;ve wanted one of these since I saw the announcement but they are very expensive (over £100) so we went with the 16K model instead of the 48K.</description>

      <description>This mightn&amp;rsquo;t be a big deal to most people but it&amp;rsquo;s a huge deal to me. If my parents hadn&amp;rsquo;t got me a ZX Spectrum in 1982, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had the life I&amp;rsquo;ve had. No exaggeration. Every single college and career choice I&amp;rsquo;ve made stems from the skills I learned on that machine, which I still have (the machine, not the skills :-) ).

Sure 50% of the time I was playing Jet Set Willy and Sabre Wulf but on the Speccy I learned BASIC, Forth and Z80 assembler.</description>

      <description>I cannot understand why Christy O&amp;rsquo;Sullivan thinks he&amp;rsquo;ll get a vote from me. Here is a guy shoe-horned in by FF at a national level who sends me flyers with absolutely no information on them about who he is, what he believes in, where he lives, what he has accomplished as a politician or why I should vote for him.
And of course his website doesn&amp;rsquo;t load!
Inserting this nobody over a well known local politician like Alan Coleman is a huge mistake by FF.</description>

      <description>As a lot of you know, you can get a Digital version of RTÉ (including Widescreen) on Sky Digital and NTL. However you must have a Sky/NTL subscription to see it. Many people, including myself, believe this is fundamentally wrong as we already support RTÉ through the mandatory TV licence.
Please sign the petition from Brian Greene demanding that RTE make digital broadcasts of their programming available for &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo;. If you are a blogger, consider adding the badge in support.</description>

      <description>due to the TB outbreak in Cork.
 Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs. But, TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal. TB disease was once the leading cause of death in the United States.
TB is spread through the air from one person to another.</description>

      <description>Given that this blog is six years old this week and we&amp;rsquo;ve started reminiscing about the good old days of Engineering in Merrion Street and Earlsfort Terrace, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that it&amp;rsquo;s officially Nostalgia Week here at O&amp;rsquo;Neill Towers.
Knarf reminded me of Jimmy Jamjars at the gates to Merrion Street. Catherine reminded me of The Jimmy Jamjar Awards. I think Teresa won one in 1991 for the largest number of PFOs of any Engineering student.</description>

      <description>So he is only five years old and this was his first ever GAA session.
He reported back that he played hurling and soccer. His Nana from Meath better have a word with him about Gaelic Football.
Next week we are sending him in Kilkenny gear to shake things up a bit ;-)
Bloody hell, now I have two hurlers in the house. Who would ever have thought?</description>

      <description>17th April 2001, I got an account on this thing I probably heard about on Slashdot called Blogger. I just saw it as an easier way of keeping my personal homepage (which I think I started in 1996 on Indigo) up-to-date.
How wrong I was. The second blog post was 7th August 2001.
For the first 4 years, the blog mainly consisted of baby announcements of my friends and my job situation.</description>

      <description>Paul Brennan let me know the other day about a very worthwhile effort by his friend Hugh Bergin. Hugh is doing a motorbike trip from Kilkenny to Capetown. It is a personal trip but he&amp;rsquo;s trying to raise some money for the charity Self Help. Self Help is an Irish development agency engaged in promoting and implementing integrated sustainable development programmes in rural Africa.
He started his journey late in 2006 and he is currently in the Congo region, still going strong and keeping a diary of his adventure.</description>

      <description>I was a bit sad today to read this from the UCD Alumni office:
 UCD will soon be saying goodbye to Earlsfort Terrace and completing the move to Belfield. Generations of students spent their university years at the Terrace and hold fond memories of that time. This year, the last medical and engineering students will make the journey to Belfield and the Terrace will transfer to the National Concert Hall for major redevelopment as a multipurpose concert venue.</description>

      <description>Justin has done a great post on Patricia McKenna of the Green Party trying to justify non-vaccination of children on The Last Word radio show. The transcript shows what Cooper is capable of when he puts his mind to it. He slays the idiot and her nonsense.
If your child dies from the side-effects of measles, it&amp;rsquo;ll be due to you listening to uniformed clueless dimwits like her. Remember that when you are casting your vote.</description>

      <description>It was an interesting bit of fun but I don&amp;rsquo;t think the daily Tweet digest was a great addition to this blog. However, if you are still interested in the Tweets themselves, you can subscribe via RSS to the feed here. I may set up a separate simple blog which does the daily digest. If I do, I&amp;rsquo;ll pop a link here.</description>

      <description>#### Best Bond since Goldfinger. Great plot, good acting, actually exciting stunts.  Review of product: [Casino Royale (2006) Movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/) Rated as 4/5 on Apr 03 2007 by Conor O&#39;Neill ![](http://beta.loudervoice.com/static/images/small-star.png)![](http://beta.loudervoice.com/static/images/small-star.png)![](http://beta.loudervoice.com/static/images/small-star.png)![](http://beta.loudervoice.com/static/images/small-star.png)![](http://beta.loudervoice.com/static/images/small-non-star.png) Initially everyone hated the idea of Daniel Craig doing Bond. Then the movie came out and they all ate crow. We finally saw it on DVD over the weekend and it was worth the wait. It&#39;s back to the cold, harsh, darkly witty Bond of old with so much of the baggage of thirty years discarded.</description>

      <description>In a more litigious country, the HSE would now find itself on the end of a class action suit due to the non-administration of the BCG to children in the Cork region. The only region in the country that does not do it.
The HSE now have a moral duty to to provide the BCG to every single person born in this region who was never given it. Or maybe it would be cheaper to fill the Cappagh and Blanchardstown again.</description>

      <description>At what point in the 1980&amp;rsquo;s/1990&amp;rsquo;s did back bacon take over from streaky bacon? I assume it was all the low-fat food nazis who caused it to happen. Go to Tesco Wilton now and in an entire row of bacon, you may see one crappy pack of &amp;ldquo;pale streaky rashers&amp;rdquo; on special offer. Oh and pancetta of course, which is tooooooootally different.
I always look forward to bacon in US hotels when I travel because they still understand the art of the streaky rasher.</description>

      <description>Got an email from Cork GreenMap telling me about a new feasibility study that Cork City Council are doing in the area of Car Sharing.
 Cork City Council is considering the feasibility of the setting up of a car-sharing service – also called “car club” in the UK – in Cork City:
http://www.corkcorp.ie/ourservices/roads/carsharing.shtml
What is car-sharing? Car-sharing in urban areas is a cost-effective alternative to owning your own car. It allows people access to a car when they need it, from a place near their home or workplace.</description>

      <description>I just got a mail from someone thinking about re-locating from New York to Cork City. She asked what the job situation was like in Social Working. Any of my readers have knowledge in this area? Are there many jobs to be had? With who? In what areas? What qualifications do you need? Any equivalence given to foreign qualifications? Any pointers or useful sites they should check out? Thanks.</description>

Despite myself I&#39;m enjoying Fame Academy but it pales in comparison to the TV gold that was The Apprentice tonight.</description>

      <description>I still have the shakes and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s all drink related. Truly, madly, deeply stunned to win Best Blog Post at the awards last night. Thanks a million times over to all of you who voted for me. It was a bloody brilliant night overall and the highlight was Bernie refusing to take the &amp;ldquo;Best Contribution to the Irish Bloggersphere&amp;rdquo; award and giving it to Damien instead. A well deserved standing ovation ensued.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gone and got a Twitter account anyway.
What is Twitter you may ask? Well it is a web-site where you say what you are doing right now. You can do it via web, SMS or IM. Cos we all have such interesting lives and all our friends need to know exactly what we are doing at every moment in time. &amp;ldquo;finger up right nostril&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;finger up left nostril&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;bogey rolling&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;bogey flicking&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Poor Oisín is terribly unlucky with his front teeth. When he was 2-ish he fell off a changing table and impacted one of his front teeth up into the bone and split the lip and gum. Nothing could be done except let it heal. That tooth was much shorter than the other one until yesterday. Then yesterday evening, he fell off a stool and did a repeat performance, this time knocking out his other tooth and making a mush of his upper lip again.</description>

      <description>Ah crap. JD posted a comment here earlier letting me know that he went to Gourmet Burger in Portlaoise the other day and they have already closed down to concentrate on their Dublin business. I&amp;rsquo;m so pissed off about this. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is lack of market in this case, but lack of marketing. How many thousand cars go up and down the N7 and N8 every day? I never once saw an ad for them.</description>

      <description>I decided to try out AllFreeCalls.ie this afternoon. I had to ring Casio Customer Support in the UK about my poxy unfixable watch and my guess was that it would a longish call. I rang the access number and a voice told me that I would be charged at local rates and to enter the number I wanted. I entered the UK number and got through to the queuing system in Casio immediately.</description>

      <description>I bought a nice Casio Waveceptor watch about 18 months ago from a great discount online store in Wales called The Time Zone. It&amp;rsquo;s a combined analogue/digital job and syncs the time using those big transmitters scattered around Europe.
The watch worked fine for a few months and then the analogue bit started losing hours and hours. I returned it to Casio UK who replaced the battery and sent it back.</description>

      <description>Some of you may have heard about AllFreeCalls which allows people in the US to call internationally for the price of a call to Iowa (often free). This is a service run by a great guy called Pat Phelan in Cork.
Well they&amp;rsquo;ve just gone and extended it to Ireland. If you have one of those free national calls packages that most of the telcos like Eircom and BT here provide, then you can call international numbers for zero cost using AllFreeCalls.</description>

      <description>Our start-up LouderVoice got a nice mention in the Irish-language daily newspaper Lá. We were at an un-conference called BarCamp Ireland South-East in Waterford and Conn Ó Muíneacháin did a nice write up about it. Due to my desperately rusty Irish, I had to make use of this online dictionary to translate some of the words. Whilst it is a great resource, it seems to be lacking a huge number of words and also only seems to handle the roots of of words (or whatever it is called i.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether this is good or bad news, and either way it has no impact on my life, but Lous Vuitton is buying Aston Martin. Sure they are both luxury brands but mixing handbags and camshafts - I&amp;rsquo;m just not sure. It smacks of one of those &amp;ldquo;synergy&amp;rdquo; horrors which used to be so common. Maybe Daniel Craig will sport a man-purse in the next Bond movie.
Hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll do something about the rear-end of all recent Astons which to my eye are identical to a mid-1990&amp;rsquo;s Mazda.</description>

      <description>My sister Orla bought me a pasta machine for Christmas and I finally got around to trying it out on Saturday.

Myself and Sibéal decided to make a mix of tagliatelle and spaghetti. Neither of us had made it before and her excuse is that she is only 3.
I had the usual recipe problem of not knowing which one to use. Jamie Oliver&amp;rsquo;s Italy book said 6 eggs and 600g of flour and that&amp;rsquo;s it.</description>

      <description>Oscar is a bright kid who loves to read. His favourite novel is Le Catalogue d&amp;rsquo;Argos. In fact he loves the Horrid Henry series (and other similar ones). The only subject he is weak in is, surprise surprise, Irish. Unlike Oisín and Sibéal, he never went to Naoinra so started on it cold in junior infants. We&amp;rsquo;re hoping to get him into Irish as a bit of a challenge but the books have to engage him.</description>

      <description>Just spotted on the BBC that The Jesus and Mary Chain are re-forming to do some festival. I bloody loved that band. Psychocandy is in my top ten albums of all time. I remember playing it to my friends in 1985 and they all laughed at me. &amp;ldquo;But it&amp;rsquo;s just noise Conor&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Wait, just wait, you&amp;rsquo;ll see. This is genius&amp;rdquo;.
Any movie that uses their music gets an instant thumbs up from me.</description>

      <description>It appears the opposition parties have started their campaign to lose the next general election with their latest himbo/bimbo scheme which they picked up from the UK. They want traffic lights on food to indicate the levels of salt, sugar and fat. Not only are the stuck in the 1980&amp;rsquo;s with the fat obsession, but they show such a basic mis-understanding of human nature that the scheme was obviously devised by a marxist.</description>

      <description>Yes I know it&amp;rsquo;s just another &amp;ldquo;kids say the funniest things&amp;rdquo; post but this wee 5-year old thinks deeper than most.
Never promise a bed-time story and then renege: &amp;ldquo;Dad when I grow up, I&amp;rsquo;m going to get married like you, and have babies like you, and forget things like you&amp;rdquo;
Recent obsession with death: &amp;ldquo;Dad, when we all die, does that mean someone else might live in our house?&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Yes they will Ois&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>My Dad kindly voted for this blog in several categories in the Blog Awards earlier. He mailed me to say that it reminded him of my Granny (Mary O&amp;rsquo;Neill) who voted for Dev eight times in the 1932 elections on both sides of the bridge in New Ross. Could you imagine if those old Cumann na mBan women were around now and decided to help the blog result?

      <description>As with all the previous episodes, this one is a zinger even if you were a C64 or (god forbid) Dragon user. I had stopped my involvement with home computers by 1987, what with being in college and discovering drink instead. So I found it particularly interesting that they mention a game called &amp;ldquo;Head Over Heels&amp;rdquo; which was considered by many to be the greatest example of its genre ever created.</description>

      <description>We discovered over Christmas that you can in fact put 5 children, 2 adults and all their stuff in a Zafira+Roofbox and go from Cork to Kilkenny to Cavan to Cork. Hurrah.
On our trip back from Cavan on the joke&amp;rsquo;s of national routes known as the N55 and N62, we got to Roscrea and Oscar decided to puke. We caught most of it in a nappy bag and then I dropped the bag as I exited it from the car.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been getting lots of contraceptive advice from men my age. It seems the only logical route is vasectomy. One of my best advisors had his done quite a while back with no adverse effects. There is only one guy in Cork who does it, Dr Pillay on Patrick St and he highly recommended him. He also (quietly) mentioned that performance would not be affected and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be shooting blanks for the first thirty.</description>

      <description>So Haydn tagged me. Five things you don&amp;rsquo;t know about me eh? Apart from my Spaghetti Hoop fetish?
1. I was Junior Irish Archery Champion in 1980. Not as impressive as it sounds. Three of us in the competition and other two were beginners. Never improved after that and gave up in mid-teens. Turns out not everyone else saw a blob of colours down the end of the field and I later found out I was short-sighted.</description>

      <description>Those of you who know me well also know that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past few months working hard on building a new web-site called LouderVoice. We&amp;rsquo;re coming close to launching the site properly (probably in late January or early February) but before we do we would really like to have some people help us try out the site and tell us what they think.
The plan at the moment is that we&amp;rsquo;ll be inviting a very small number of people we know into the Beta1 phase in the next few days.</description>

      <description>If you have Windows XP and if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened already then Microsoft appear to be pushing out the new release of the Internet Explorer Web Browser. They are making it optional so you have to agree to install before they do (the security centre logo in the bottom right hand corner of the screen that looks like a shield will be yellow with an exclamation mark in it).
For almost all web users who don&amp;rsquo;t use Firefox as their browser, IE7 is a big improvement over IE6.</description>

I used to watch Oz and Jilly for laughs back in the old Food and Drink days. They were so off the wall I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever learned anything. James is of course Captain Slow on Top Gear and knows absolutely nothing about wine.</description>

      <description>Catherine discovered Haydn and Roos&amp;rsquo; latest blog yesterday, it is called One Breast Less and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to tell you what it is about. This is a shockingly good blog with a raw honesty that caught me off-guard but is a mandatory read if you have any interest in health, illness and recovery.

      <description>I set-up the Bandon Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market Blog quite a while back. Progress has been slow with getting vendors to use it and I think this is mainly due to them not being familiar at all with [a] blogging and [b] the idea that they can write something and it appears immediately. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot in trying to get one or two people set up on it. The main lesson was that if you are not web-savvy, many things which seem obvious to me can actually be insurmountable hurdles to others.</description>

I recently did a pit stop at the new Midway Food Court on the M7/M8 split outside Portlaoise but was disappointed to only find O&#39;Brien&#39;s open. I went back again on Monday to grab a quick sambo and noticed that one new place was open - &#34;</description>

      <description>I saw the first episode of Heston&amp;rsquo;s cookery series on TV this evening. He simultaneously tickled my foodie and engineering fancies with some of the things he showed. He deconstructed the classic Black Forest Gateau, found out what the real essence of it was and then rebuilt it using some awesome techniques.
Watching him aerate chocolate using a Tupperware container, a vacuum-bag for storing clothes and a vacuum cleaner was a 2006 TV highlight for me.</description>

      <description>When Haydn asked the question recently on the BarCamp Ireland blog if anybody had&amp;nbsp;any favourite Irish entertainment sites/blogs and I replied,&amp;nbsp;little did I know that he was going to quote me more than once in The Irish Times. I thought it would be just&amp;nbsp;part of a&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Conor likes this&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Mick likes that&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Mary&amp;nbsp;like these&amp;rdquo; list. Chuffed?

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why it is so hard to find this info so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post it here to solve that problem.
A lot of Sky customers don&amp;rsquo;t know that there are many other free channels accessible on the various Astra satellites (like the good old analogue days) which you can programme into your Sky Digibox. From talking to other parents, by far the most popular of these has to be CBBC and CBeebies.</description>

      <description>Leslie Dowdall is playing The Brogan Inn in Bandon soon!
Pause, little shudder of excitement, continue.
For those of you too young to remember, Leslie was to many Irish men who are now in their late thirties, the 1980&amp;rsquo;s equivalent of Jessica Alba. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if Hot Press had pull-out posters of her, but they should have. She sang with a band called In Tua Nua who were famous for 6 months in Grangemockler (five miles from Windgap).</description>

      <description>Cork-&amp;gt;Rosslare, Rosslare-&amp;gt;Cork on a Bank Holiday Weekend. Number of cops encountered? Big fat zero. Number of hard-of-thinking suicidal cretins encountered? 4.
Oh but they did arrest over 100 drunk drivers today. Keep that up for 365 days a year and maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll be something other than a reflection of their day-to-day incompetence as they waste taxpayers money snaring people doing 45 in 40 zones on bypasses across the country.

      <description>I have 4 kids (soon to be 5), 3 boys and 1 girl. Sibéal gives as good as she gets as far as fight are concerned. She has a very non-girly mother and only a slightly girly Dad. Yet this is what she spent all day yesterday in whilst chasing her cousin Rachel (similarly attired).

      <description>Give us €2 for every kid who wants to use the playground and shag off if you want to use it at 5pm on a Bank Holiday Saturday.
Hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a great idea, €5 per beach walk from 9pm to 5.30pm with a half day on Saturday.
But the nice new pastry place goes some way towards making up for the gouge.

      <description>This site has been around for ages but I only discovered it today. It is a Google Maps mashup that allows you to click anywhere in the world and then it shows you where you would come out on the other side of the world if you dug straight down. I was stunned to see that you come out near New Zealand if you dig from Ireland. Many a childhood sleepless night for nothing.</description>

      <description>We had an hour to kill in Cork whilst waiting for Oscar to finish one of his many activities. I told them I&amp;rsquo;d bring them to a playground.


&amp;ldquo;That was the worst playground ever, wasn&amp;rsquo;t it Dad?&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Like really crap, like?&amp;rdquo;.
Any tips for playgrounds in the County Hall, Model Farm Rd, College Rd, Mardyke area?

C&amp;rsquo;mon, best play on words ever.
Then tonight they nearly go one better as he announces that he has to go home to write &amp;ldquo;The Bob Loblaw Law Blog&amp;rdquo;

      <description>At this stage a huge number of people have camera phones and actually use the camera to take those impromptu pictures. I remember asking why anyone would want a camera phone three years ago. What the hell would you take pictures of? Well, it turns out I had no imagination and I now take pictures of everything and anything.
Now most people take the picture and either send it by MMS to friends n family or just show it on the phone to people later.</description>

      <description>Handed down through generations of sufi mystics and carried by the Priory of Sion to Bandon where it remained undiscovered in a secret vault until excavations found the ancient stone etchings, I can now reveal the best chicken tikka masala recipe on the planet.
More accurately, I was given a stocking-filler cookbook by my sister years ago which came with packets of spices. It did lay undiscovered for over five years until I finally used it to make a tikka paste and then used their recipe for chicken tikka.</description>

      <description>If you live anywhere in the Cork/Waterford/Tipp area and have fixed line broadband with any provider then you may have been having problems since last Friday. I was getting 40 kbs instead of 2 mbs since Monday rendering the internet connection almost useless. Eircom fixed it for their customers yesterday and fixed it for their competitors this morning. Normal service should have returned everywhere. Yet another reason for us all to switch over to Wimax and HSDPA wireless broadband when it gets rolled out rather than using a set of providers who clearly couldn&amp;rsquo;t give a damn.</description>

      <description>Oisín continues to come out with the funniest lines in the house. He refused to eat his dinner yesterday on the grounds that it was food for cats. Were we trying to feed him Whiskas perhaps? Or maybe KiteKat or Iams? No, it was lasagne.
All of this because his older brother, in an effort to get him to eat it, pointed out that lasagne is what Garfield eats.</description>

      <description>Two of my favourite automotive blogs used to be Autoblog and Jalopnik. I had to unsubscribe from both due to the huge number of posts they were doing daily which I just could not keep up with (same reason I only lasted a few weeks with Blogorrah).
Alex Algard mailed me last week to tell me about a new car blog that he has launched called CarDomain Blog. I have to say it is the dogs for over-aged car nuts like me.</description>

      <description>I love paying €3 to fly to Gatwick but the thought of them running trans-Atlantic flights makes my blood run cold. How many Bullseyes do they think they could sell to the average punter over 5 hours to deaden the headache caused by the yellow everywhere?
On the upside, I&amp;rsquo;d happily pay €5 an hour to have a PSP embedded in the seat back in front of me. But will he really do that?</description>

      <description>You can say what you like about Top Gear but I can&amp;rsquo;t stop myself loving it. It is silly, childish and predictable but it is one of the few programmes I look forward to in the week.
Sadly, I just heard that Richard Hammond was critically injured in a crash&amp;nbsp;in a jet car doing upwards of 280 MPH! Fingers crossed that he recovers.

I heard that for the first time back in the early 1990&amp;rsquo;s, probably on one of the stand-up shows on TV. Or did he support Dylan Moran at some Irish gig?

They&amp;rsquo;ve called it the iTV. Sadly for UK purchasers, this means that it&amp;rsquo;ll only be capable of playing Corrie, Heartbeat, Celebrity Love Island and repeats of Crossroads.

      <description>I just got a mail from Colum over at Cully and Sully to say they are going to be on the TV tonight. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know them they have two main businesses: The first is supplying lovely pies to pubs whose only cooking apparatus is a microwave. The second is supplying same/similar&amp;nbsp;packaged pies to supermarkets. Now we normally never buy pre-made dinners but their ones are&amp;nbsp;really gorgeous and you get to&amp;nbsp;keep a nice ceramic dish when you are finished.</description>

      <description>Craig sent me this picture taken by a tourist in a Dublin playground. To save you having to zoom the picture, the warning sign says &amp;ldquo;These lands are bring treated for rat infestation and have been laid with poison&amp;rdquo;.
Happy days.

      <description>So I bitched about Voda (twice) and the fact that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t upgrade the software on my N70 mobile. Then Ciarán, an old workmate, pointed out that I could get the phone unlocked by just calling customer service.
It turns out that they have to ask Nokia for the unlock codes for the N-series, five days later they texted me the code and now the phone can work with any SIM card (like Roam4Free for example).</description>

      <description>Well Google have just released their most impressive service in a long long time. Over at News Archive Search you can search on a bunch of newspapers worldwide going way back. In many cases you have to pay to see the scan of the paper itself but you can read the actual text for free.
As a test I put in the phrase &amp;ldquo;famine Ireland&amp;rdquo; and then selected &amp;ldquo;before 1880&amp;rdquo; and found a newspaper article from The Republican Compiler of Gettysburg on March 1st 1847 which mentions the suffering caused by the Irish famine.</description>

      <description>Every once in a while I still need to receive a fax. I continue to be surprised by the number of people who don&amp;rsquo;t know that you don&amp;rsquo;t need a fax machine to do this.
If you are on Vodafone, make sure you have set up a Vodafone email account and then just give out your mobile number preceded with a 5 as your fax number i.e. +353-87-5NNNNNNN. The fax is then sent to a special folder on Vodafone email and you get an SMS to say it is there.</description>

      <description>If you want to try out the world of blogging, I highly recommend the new free&amp;nbsp;Windows Live Writer tool for creating your content. It works with almost any blogging site. Check out Wordpress.com to get an actual blog (also free). One of the main developers is from Cork you know!
Just to show one of the neat things that Live Writer can do, I was able to insert this map of Bandon with a few simple clicks.</description>

      <description>Do make it down if you haven&amp;rsquo;t been before or haven&amp;rsquo;t been in a while. There are a bunch of new great stalls.
Julian from Bubble Brothers also pointed out in a comment on the Ummera Blog that there will be wine tasting in Urru on Saturday too. So maybe wander down there after the market and check it out.

      <description>I was all excited for 20 minutes today. Nokia have released a free tool to enable you to upgrade your own phone firmware.
I grabbed the one for the N70, backed up the phone, installed the software and waited for it to analyse my phone. Result? I have the latest available Vodafone branded firmware so no upgrade is possible.
The Voda numbnuts haven&amp;rsquo;t released an upgrade since last September! Meanwhile I have a good phone which would be far far better with the improved firmware.</description>

      <description>We took a day trip to Killarney for some ice-cream yesterday. The drive down is always longer than the distance would indicate. Is there any hope the Cork to Killarney road will ever move from being of third-world quality from Ovens to Ballyvourney?
It took a bit of circling but we found the fabulous playground mentioned by Kieran and all had a fantastic time. That climbing web is awesome and the zip-line was very tempting.</description>

      <description>But when I did, I laughed out loud.&amp;nbsp;Courtesy of marketing guru Seth Godin.
&amp;nbsp;Human beings have short memories: German appliance maker Bosch introduces the Axxis™ washer.
On the topic of marketing, we spotted a sign for a restaurant on the way back from Killarney yesterday. It said &amp;ldquo;Muesli Restaurant, Vegetarian Italian&amp;rdquo;.
I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a better way&amp;nbsp;to ensure you get zero customers than to include the word muesli in your ad.</description>

      <description>Forewarned is forearmed eh?
Top tip for future signs like this&amp;nbsp;- maybe give two hints on the sign:
[1] Which ambush
[2] Which war
I was sure we were heading towards Béal na mBláth. We got there and it was Kilmichael.
Obviously put up by the same guys who did the signage in Killarney. Every single junction there has signs for City Centre for all of the directions in and out.</description>

      <description>I finally made it down to the market last week after missing three in a row. A lot of the usual stalls were missing presumably due to holidays etc and&amp;nbsp;it was a quick dash and grab by Fionn, Sibéal and I.
More stunning steaks from Aherns, some interesting and tasty Portuguese salt from Ummera, some veg from the veg man and some brot from the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Baking Emporium in Dunmanway and I was done.</description>

      <description>Osc opened a Melon and Orange yoghurt yesterday to discover it actually contained Fruit of the Forest. So did two others that he checked. In one of his favourite books &amp;ldquo;Stink and the Incredible Supergalactic Jawbreaker&amp;rdquo;, the hero (Stink) writes a letter of complaint about a jawbreaker that did not break his jaw. The result is that he gets sent a huge box full of sweets. I think maybe Oscar is hoping something similar happens here.</description>

      <description>I just spotted this over at the Signal vs Noise blog. Brilliant Kiwi comedy duo called The Conchords. Hiphopopotamus vs. Rhymenoceros is definitely the best of them.

      <description>Most people, even non-techies like my Dad, have heard of Skype at this stage. Skype gives you free PC-to-PC &amp;ldquo;phone&amp;rdquo; calls and allows you to ring normal international phone numbers for much cheaper than normal phone-to-phone calls. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it a lot and it works pretty well.
But Skype has a much less well-known competitor called Gizmo and you&amp;rsquo;d be nuts not to give them a try. Gizmo, unlike Skype, is built on a standard called SIP so it works with all other SIP-based products e.</description>

      <description>At this stage I&amp;rsquo;m sick to the back teeth of the moral relativism that passes for liberal thought in modern Europe and particularly in Ireland. Recent events in the Middle East have just amplified the noise. So it is a joy to read something as reasoned and balanced as Norm Geras&amp;rsquo; post on what is happening in Lebanon. Read the questions at the end very carefully and maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll learn something about yourself from your answers.</description>

business Macehiters Western Road Clonakilty Co Cork, Ireland   &amp;gt; &amp;#x2605;&amp;#x2605;&amp;#x2605;&amp;#x2605;&amp;#x2606; The plan last night was to grab a quick bite to eat in Clon and then go to &amp;ldquo;The wind that shakes the barley&amp;rdquo;. OK, the original plan was to go to Eddie Rockets and &amp;ldquo;The Break-Up&amp;rdquo; in Mahon. In the end we just ate in Clon and went home.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Red Mum&amp;rsquo;s recent pizza making post, the awesome DiFara Pizza story and my experiences in The Good Things Cafe recently, I decided to make some pizza-pies with the two middle childer yesterday. We made one each. Classic Margherita with simple garlic/oregano/basil/passata sauce and buffalo mozzarella.
Sibéal, aged 2:

Oisín, aged 4:

Conor, aged 38:

Which was the nicest? Yup, the 2 year old&amp;rsquo;s. After the horror of watching them &amp;ldquo;knead&amp;rdquo; the dough and drop it on the floor several times, the two little gits ended up with far superior results because [a] they were not swimming in sauce and [b] the were wafer thin cos I only gave them a small bit of dough each.</description>

They are called Trunkis and I just love the idea - a travel case that doubles as a ride-on toy. I stood in Gatwick yesterday watching kids going stir crazy in the check-in queue. These would definitely help. Might even be fun for bored adults too.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a few Quizno&amp;rsquo;s sandwich joints in the US and I really like them, particularly the fixins bar where you can add various types of whole chillis and other delights to your toasted sub.
I think it is the fastest growing franchise in the US and thought of being a franchisee even flashed through my head a few years back. But Cafe Kylemore has the rights here and there is one on the quay around the corner from Patrick St in Cork.</description>

Microdrives
You have no idea, none, how much I wanted a microdrive as a teenage geek. I would have happily chopped off my little finger yakuza-style to get one. And this guy, the luckiest man alive, has 8 of them!
And what is it about rose tinted spectacles that I would be happier now to be given a ZX Spectrum +2 with a Kempston joystick than a fully loaded Dell XPS?</description>

      <description>Only six years after everyone else.
Their upgraded Internet Banking service now supports Firefox/ Mozilla/ IE7/ dunno_what_else. Previously they only supported Internet Explorer with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s own Java VM and, wait for it, Netscape 4.7!
How embarrassing must it have been to work in web development in that company? I sent them stinky mails about once every six months for the past few years including links to the Microsoft site where the continued use of the MS VM was listed as a no-no.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 1: Normally when I do reviews I use the Structured Blogging plug-in. Its biggest flaw is that you can only do one review per post and the &amp;ldquo;reviews&amp;rdquo; below do not warrent separate posts. An alternative is to use the simple hReview creator over at microformats.org and then just cut n past a bunch of reviews into one post. So I have restructured and republished this review in that format (after seeing Tantek do the same).</description>

      <description>It took a lot of poking and prodding with the scanner but the consultant finally decided that it is a wee girlie.
Sibéal was thrilled when she finally understood. She initially complained that &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want a sister, I want a girl&amp;rdquo;. Older lads couldn&amp;rsquo;t give a hoot either way and Fionn was too busy screaming as I was trying to &amp;ldquo;teach&amp;rdquo; him how to use a beaker.

Sign up with them and pay €9.99 for two stickers which you can attach to valuables like mobile phones. The sticker has a telephone number, code and message about a reward to the finder if it is lost.</description>

      <description>Another memorable quote from &amp;ldquo;The Apprentice, Martha Stewart&amp;rdquo;.
On a completely unrelated topic, Digg has gone to Version 3. Digg is a news site whose top stories are voted into position by the users. Up until now it was mainly tech but they have branched out in V3.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never used it much as it causes total information overload. But the Diggnation Podcast with Alex and Kevin is hysterically funny.</description>

Here are just a few:

 Melrose Place

 TJ Hooker

Now that&amp;rsquo;s just not fair, two phrases in one title to draw the moth into the flame. Not only do they have a series which is guaranteed to have at least 80% nut-jobs, morons and chancers on it, but then they build it around the wicked witch of the west, the anti-Darina, beelzeebubina, Martha Magdalene Stewart.</description>

I explained to Oisín that this was the starting point in the supply chain for all dairy products. He was suitably impressed.

Some very confused looking Llamas. I thought of my Grandad when I saw these and wondered what he would think if he was alive.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not just saying that because it&amp;rsquo;s my local one. They keep adding really great stalls. I think the most important one is Ahern&amp;rsquo;s organic meats. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit easy to miss them because all the meat is in a freezer trailer and they just have a small table with the product list and prices. I got two t-bones and a bunch of burgers off them. Looking forward to BBQing them today in the rain.</description>

      <description>Yoplait have recently completely changed the labels on their yoghurts. Our kids are now refusing to eat them &amp;ldquo;cos they are not the same&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;m willing to be that a huge percentage of yoghurt sales are for kids. Did any brand manager actually ask any kids what they thought? Any blip noticed in sales? Blip down, right?
Sometimes, just sometimes, leaving things as they are is the smart thing to do.</description>

      <description>ElectricNews reports that Vodafone launches flat-rate 3G access.
€49 incl VAT sounds excellent but I&amp;rsquo;ll bet that is on top of a basic plan so there is no way we will end up paying less than €78 EUR per month. Fine if you are in business, silly if you are not. Another wasted opportunity? I&amp;rsquo;d be ringing them now to sign up if they halved the price.
I think I quoted a tenner as being reasonable.</description>

      <description>Where were the multi-coloured windbreakers when I needed them? Flasks of milky tea and gritty sandwiches would have helped too. But the kids didn&amp;rsquo;t notice and had a whale of a time. Long Strand is still one of the most impressive beaches in Cork. I&amp;rsquo;m only disappointed that the para-glider-surfer-thingy dude disappeared before I could get a photo.
Ah shur the sun will come out any minute now:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the N70 since April and I&amp;rsquo;m still in two minds about it. My biggest beef is less with Nokia and more with Vodafone.
When I got the phone, I checked the firmware and it was at v2.x whilst a check on the web said that the latest was v5.x. I went into Choice Communications in Cork city and asked for an upgrade. It came back with exactly the same version.</description>

      <description>Nick Humphries has done it again.The 1986 edition of &amp;ldquo;The Your Sinclair Rock n Roll Years TV Show&amp;rdquo; was released for download recently. All nostalgic ZX Spectrum fans should grab it and watch 8 minutes of great memories. Non-Speccy fans can listen to the music and Apprentice fans can laugh at how young Alan Sugar looks in it.
1986 was simultaneously the peak of my Spectrum involvement and also my last year.</description>

      <description>I spent last weekend on a fabulous 2-day cookery course down in deep West Cork in The Good Things Cafe in Durrus. I honestly won&amp;rsquo;t be able to come up with enough superlatives to describe the fantastic programme that Carmel Somers put together. It is now Tuesday and I&amp;rsquo;m still buzzed and still full.

It&amp;rsquo;s not too bad a drive from Bandon - about an hour on the crappy but scenic Dunmanway Road.</description>

      <description>Oscar the little sod broke the hinge on his DS again. Definitely a design flaw. The guy who provided the last replacement case no longer ships out of the US.
Luckily some knock-off merchants on e-bay are selling clone cases in a variety of colours. Got a replacement funky dark grey one for him for £8.88 incl postage from Hong Kong. Not only is their Englsih a joy to read, check out their spelling on Nintendo.</description>

      <description>I could be a cynical smartass and say that the people in this movie look a little too close to Christopher Guest&amp;rsquo;s character in &amp;ldquo;Best in Show&amp;rdquo; but it really looks like a wonderful movie about people who are passionate about Barbeque/Barbecue.
The horror that we perform in Ireland is what they call grilling (or more accurately &amp;ldquo;incineration&amp;rdquo;). What these guys do takes hours and hours and hours. I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten the result in Texas - they should have Michelin stars.</description>

      <description>Technology in the wrong hands is dangerous. I just turned on the &amp;ldquo;Sing Along&amp;rdquo; feature on the Sky+ Box for the Croatian Eurovision entry. The first translation was &amp;ldquo;the grass has not yet sprouted&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing their entry came from the Croatian version of Teagasc.
But my favourite was when they translated &amp;ldquo;Oj, da da da da da da&amp;rdquo; to&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;wait for it&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;. &amp;ldquo;Oy, da da da da da da&amp;rdquo;.
Brian has just been on and sadly had the same attack of sciatica that laid him so low in the semi-finals.</description>

      <description>Any country brave enough to have a hobbit and a garden gnome as their backing singers deserves to win.
To be fair to Daniel O&amp;rsquo;Donnell Brian Kennedy, he did allow his grandad to be one of his backing singers. His song &amp;ldquo;Bacardi and Coke please Mafanwy&amp;rdquo; really pulled at the heartstrings like a bad case of angina.
The best aspect of his performance was that he decided to keep his thighs covered, a decision I wish many of the other performers had also made.</description>

 See link below for a glorious, hilarious mess-up by the BBC. A producer rushed to the reception area and mistakenly took a mini-cab driver to be a interviewed live on BBC 24 news as an &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; on the internet about the Apple case. There is a video link - see the hilarious expression at the beginning on the cabbies face when he realizes it was a case of mistaken ID - he then bluffs his way brilliantly through the interview.</description>

[1 ] Jeremy Clarkson and a Ford GT40
[2] Brokeback Knightrider with Jake Gyllenhaal as Michael Knight and Heath Ledger as the voice of the car.

Ruth is like a good Tequila - it scares you just a bit but always delivers the goods.

Well worth seeking out, particularly for the description of the overwhelming stench of s***te that used to accompany the market in the old days.</description>

      <description>He got rid of The Tulip and is keeping The Black Widow! My only recollection of her over the entire series is swigging champagne in Top Shop. I have to hand it to her, she has slyed her way through to the end. Another dark horse like Tim last year? I hope not. But at least my fave, The Badger, got through.

      <description>Our 9 year old tv has gone on the blink. It was a great 32&amp;rdquo; Philips Matchline job whose only drawback was that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t widescreen. We started on the hunt for a replacement on Saturday. Tried Soundstore, Harvey Norman, Xtravision, O&amp;rsquo;Dwyer&amp;rsquo;s and a few online places.
Result? It is nearly impossible to get a high-end 32&amp;rdquo; CRT TV any more. Philips, JVC, Panasonic and Sony have a tiny selection of wide-screen boxes with less functionality than four years ago.</description>

      <description>Bloody Brilliant, and we only watched the practice runs.
We positioned ourselves at the finish line on the advice of a steward (&amp;ldquo;they&amp;rsquo;ll reach max speed there&amp;rdquo;). It took a while to get going but the organisation of the event was really professional. Fionn (aged 9 months) screamed every time a bike also screamed across the line. Oisín hid in a buggy, Shibs was unimpressed and Oscar went quiet.
Most of the family left after a few minutes due to the noise, leaving Oscar and myself to enjoy the smell of burning rubber.</description>

Roco&amp;rsquo;s was a middle-of-the-road place which I ate in twice. The food was fine and the place was always hopping.</description>

      <description>8 years after I first bought a tube of wasabi to make sushi, I finally managed to get everything in one place and made my first ever batch. I followed the instructions in &amp;ldquo;Rachel&amp;rsquo;s Favourite Food for Friends&amp;rdquo;. It turned out damned tasty but not exactly pretty. I&amp;rsquo;m sure sushi experts would cry over my efforts. Some pictures below. In case you are wondering, the kids medicine syringe was to measure out 30ml of rice vinegar.</description>

      <description>Headed down to Skibb the morning for a few reasons: give the demon children a sleep, get some fish for a fish pie, go to the excellent playground there. On the way I noticed a fabulous playground in Leap. Beautiful wooden structures all inside a big metal fence. But then I noticed the sign on the gate &amp;ldquo;closed until further notice&amp;rdquo;. Anyone know why? If it is due to insurance then I&amp;rsquo;ll be forced to go to the nearest courthouse, find a savage claiming compo and headbutt them.</description>

[Check out this picture](http://www.freewebs.com/wcmotorcycleclub/bandondragraces.htm) to see what you can expect. I actually have no idea at what time it is on, I&#39;ll just listen out for the sound of screaming bike engines and head on down.</description>

They think eGullet, the best food forum on the web, is a GPORN site. I&amp;rsquo;ll need help with this one. Guava Pr0n? Grapefruit Pr0n? Gremolata Pr0n?
Next week, Firewall rates &amp;ldquo;Give My Head Peace&amp;rdquo; site as Humorous.

      <description>For fun, I set up Google AdSense last year. It is behind those ads you see in the sidebar of the blog. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to make much money and never thought I&amp;rsquo;d be able to live off the Ad revenue.
I just checked my total income and it is now at $4.02! Woo hoo. It seems to me that there is a very good reason for it - the ads are complete shite.</description>

      <description>After all my encouragement to go to Saturday&amp;rsquo;s Bandon Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market I ended up missing it myself. I got up a bit late and had to get ready for our weekend in Rosslare. I ended up squeezed for time and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be shopping hassled. So, I headed off with the four angels and left Catherine to plant the garden and paint the loo. Result? Garden good, loo baaaaaadddddd. We&amp;rsquo;re not quite in marriage counselling but that red has to go.</description>

      <description>The biggest hole in the Irish Blogging scene is the lack of women bloggers. I have no real idea why so few women blog, particularly when examples like Dooce are there to show what is possible. It probably just boils down to the fact that, in general (and by &amp;ldquo;in general&amp;rdquo; I am in no way trying to invoke a stereotye or in any way label any sub-grouping of humanity. Please don&amp;rsquo;t hurt me), women don&amp;rsquo;t get a kick out of geeky gadgets and buzzwords and only start using technology when it becomes genuinely useful.</description>

      <description>One of the best TV ads I have ever seen for a motor car. Must be a couple of minutes long and surely costs a fortune to broadcast. But worth it for them if they are ever to change the UK demographic from 55-85 to 25-35. They rightly have much younger buyers in Ireland. Just checked and they have some of the sound effects from the ad on their UK site too.</description>

      <description>Every year is the &amp;ldquo;Year of Something&amp;rdquo;. In the web world, many are calling 2006 the year of podcasting and I do think it is the year that a big shift in peoples reading/listening habits is happening. I have formulated my theory using a highly scientific principle derived from dianetics called &amp;ldquo;my clueless opinion based on a sample size of one&amp;rdquo;.
Let me explain:

Richard MacManus and the gang have done a tremendous job and I think it is now communicating the whole idea in a far more effective way than it did in the past. They explain it far better than I can here so go and have a read.
If you read this blog regularly, you will have noticed some posts which appear to have more structure than others (mainly my reviews and event notifications).</description>

Ajay D&amp;rsquo;Souza, the creator of this great theme, has just released v1.5 and I have upgraded to that. So far I have spotted no problems and I like all of the improvements. Still have to get my head around these new Wordpress Widgets. Ajay&amp;rsquo;s announcement with a list of changes is here.</description>

      <description>Like many geeks, I signed up for Riya the moment they went into public beta. This is a photo sharing site like many others (e.g. Flickr) but with the twist that it has advanced &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; techniques for recognising faces. So if you upload many pictures of the same people and train Riya a bit, then in future it will be automatically able to recognise those people in future photos and tag them accordingly for search purposes.</description>

I was just reading the latest edition of my local Bandon Opinion and saw an ad by Sinn Fein Bandon encouraging people to wear the Easter Lily.
Let me just quote the important bit: &amp;ldquo;combining the green, white and saffron of our national flag&amp;rdquo;. Green&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;White&amp;hellip;..SAFFRON? Which national flag are these cretins referring to?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to report that the first Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market in Bandon was a resounding success despite the awful weather. I&amp;rsquo;m already looking forward to next months and I hope they consider moving it to every week if the crowds hold up.
First off, apologies for the shockingly bad quality of the photos. I have the aesthetic eye of a blind person.
I headed up initially just after 10am with two of the kids.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few half-hearted attempts at doing chicken wings over the years. Usually in the oven and usually burnt beyond all recognition. I now realise that you add the sauce afterwards as anything with sugar will burn.
Recently I spotted a bunch of blog postings about buffalo wings (mainly related to the Superbowl I think) and decided I wanted to try and do them properly. I&amp;rsquo;ve always found people raving about Elephant &amp;amp; Castle chicken wings to be a bit weird.</description>

      <description>I have written some very complimentary things about Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Ice Cream recently. In addition, Kieran&amp;rsquo;s blog has become, in a few short weeks, one of the best in the country, IMHO. I gave Kieran a few tips on blogging software recently and was gob-smacked when he sent me a fabulous gift of some ice-cream and chocolate sauce (via the very facilitative Urru).
Now that I have made that disclosure, I feel comfortable in continuing to rave about their products.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Yahoo mail as my &amp;ldquo;we are a web-site, give us an email address&amp;rdquo; address for over ten years now. In that time, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it has really improved one iota in usability apart from the addition of spam catching.

      <description>Tonight 9.00, Channel 4.
From the last series:
MAC to his surgical team: What can I tell you? A few ground rules. No bombing, no running, no petting, no diving and no inflatables. In fact, probably best to leave all swimming related activities until later ; this is after all, an operating theatre.

Ireland Food rating: 5 out of 5 Decor rating: 4 out of 5 Service rating: 4 out of 5 As a traditional meat and two meat kind of guy (see my recent Meatapalooza tour of Austin, Tx), I&amp;rsquo;ve always been in two minds about going to Cafe Paradiso. On the one hand, everyone raves about the food, on the other, I need my dead animal products.</description>

 Update 1: The times above have been confirmed and here is the official flyer. I&#39;ll definitely be there.

      <description>The traditional Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day treat in our house is to get a nice simple poached eggs on toast breakfast in bed which the kids can easily help with. This year, as wifey is up the pole, soft eggs were a no-no and hard poached eggs are pooh, so we needed an alternative.
On Saturday, in a flash of inspiration I checked out &amp;ldquo;Easy Entertaining&amp;rdquo; by Darina Allen. My lovely parents got this for me at Christmas.</description>

      <description>We were in The English Market on Friday getting a few bits. I was buying the membrillo in Iago which is the bigger of the two cheese places. In passing, as Catherine is preggers, I asked if they had any pasteurised goat&amp;rsquo;s cheese. The person I asked didn&amp;rsquo;t know but one of the other ladies came over and said that no goat&amp;rsquo;s cheese or sheep&amp;rsquo;s cheese is safe to eat during pregnancy because listeria is not killed by pasteurisation.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 1: I am re-publishing this post as I did a great dis-service to Adam over at Men In Aprons by confusing his Podcast with another one. MIA is a lighthearted foodie podcast where Adam is the main presenter and he riffs with his wife and friends in the room about food related topics. Adam sent me a great e-mail describing some of the background to MIA and I have to say I really like his attitude and approach.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Is that kind of like a St Jude Miraculous Medal?&amp;rdquo;
Yeah, yeah I know it&amp;rsquo;s for &amp;ldquo;Charedee&amp;rdquo; but apart from your granny buying you this instead of socks, who does he think the target market is? Other talented singer superstars like himself? Gift Grub fans being ironic? And why does Ronan look like he is checking his arm-pit for B.O.?

So many questions, so little interest.</description>

      <description>We were over in Ovens recently looking at patio &amp;ldquo;toppings&amp;rdquo; in Irish Aggregates. On the way back I finally decided to check out Waterfall Farm Shop. I&amp;rsquo;ve known about it for more than two years and passed it a few times but just never took the extra few minutes to have a look.
The farm also appears to have a food distribution business as they had several branded vans parked in the yard.</description>

      <description>Between this blog and my posting on eGullet regarding the sort of structure people would like to see on recipes in blogs, I received the sum total of zero/null/nada/nialas replies. The world was about as vocal as that time I asked &amp;ldquo;so do I look good in these speedos?&amp;rdquo;
In retrospect I should have suggested an initial idea and then asked you all to improve on it. So read on and start entering comments.</description>

      <description>I found out about this movie/grub combo that is on next Tuesday (28th) on The Slow Food Ireland web-site. Clodagh McKenna describes it as follows: &amp;gt; A showing of the new Irish film &amp;lsquo;Short Order&amp;rsquo; in the Kino cinema, Cork at 7pm and following the film a spring supper at Cafe Paradiso at 9.30pm (there will be a half an hour gap so you can have a drink at Reidy&amp;rsquo;s bar) &amp;gt; Short Order is a new film from Irish director Anthony Byrne.</description>

      <description>I discovered goeat.ie recently and have been looking around the site. Overall it seems well designed and they have the usual bunch of reviews and competitions and recipes that you would expect on any food site.
They also have the first ever Irish Video Blogs (according to them). A very neat idea but to be honest the videos are brutal. They look like the sort of thing they used to show in the Savoy Cinema on O&amp;rsquo;Connell Street years ago before the movie.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the various posts I&amp;rsquo;ve done over the past few weeks on structured blogging and it has all been a bit beyond you, please keep reading, this won&amp;rsquo;t be.
A discussion had started on the structured blogging mailing list about creating a format for structured recipes. The idea here is that all those people who publish recipes on their blogs would hopefully move to using a common format which provides structure where appropriate but still allows for each person to do things their own way.</description>

      <description>Jalopnik is one of the two best sites on the web for petrol heads (the other being Autoblog).
Earlier this week they had a link to a wonderful video of Ayrton Senna taking a Honda NSX for a blast around a race track. Just watch his right foot blipping the throttle. Is that what you call toe-tip control? The world really is a more boring place with him gone.
But Jalopnik went one better yesterday.</description>

Hmm, not really sure what this adds over a few simple rel= tags.
Also, &amp;ldquo;Upload Image&amp;rdquo; seems to be broken for this (and for the people showcase).
Would it not make more sense to allow URLs over to Flickr etc rather than insisting that the files be hosted locally? I have the same issue with the audio and video post types too.
But I&amp;rsquo;ll post this anyway so people can see what the format is like.</description>

      <description>One of the business blogs I read is Fred Wilson over at &amp;ldquo;A VC&amp;rdquo;. He regularly recommends music worth listening to. The other day he mentioned Black Sabbath Vol 4. Apart from watching Ozzy on the TV and thinking that &amp;ldquo;Paranoid&amp;rdquo; is one of the top twenty best songs of all time, I have never listened to any Black Sabbath.
I headed on over to my fave music site at the minute &amp;ldquo;AllofMp3.</description>

100 chickens for 100 pizzas? And this woman did Economics in Cambridge?
Sugar fired Karen before this little girlie? Her dazed look during the firing session was priceless. And good old Syed came up with another classic. Sir Alan: &amp;ldquo;Tell me why I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t fire you?&amp;rdquo;. Syed:&amp;ldquo;Because I&amp;rsquo;m a winner!&amp;rdquo;. That is an all time great answer.

      <description>I hope the National Safety Council don&amp;rsquo;t mind me infringing their copyright but if publishing these pictures can save just one life then it&amp;rsquo;ll be worth it. Those lives will be saved by me not killing with my bare hands the next moron who can&amp;rsquo;t correctly negotiate the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; mini-roundabout in Bandon.


Just because you&amp;rsquo;ve driven through that junction the same way for the past 60 years like Col.</description>

      <description>AMS is really dropping the ball recently, isn&amp;rsquo;t he? How many years did it take him to finally decide to stop flogging a near-dead horse and put a bullet in the em@iler? Was no-one in the company strong enough to tell him it was the best product to come out of a British company since The Royal Carriage and Wagon company decided to compete against the Ford Model T with their new Shetland model, now with automatic pooh collection.</description>

      <description>About a month ago a guy named Eoin Feeley posted a comment on my July post about 07/07. He asked me to highlight two blogs concerned with a new movie about the genocide in Rwanda called &amp;ldquo;Shooting Dogs&amp;rdquo; starring John Hurt.
I was a bit suprised that he referred to my blog as political because apart from the odd dig at Islamo-fascists and their apologists, I mainly talk about food!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned Podchef Neal who is based on an island off Washington State on this blog several times and he posts quite a few comments here too which are always appreciated. I noticed the other day that he is proposing to organise culinary tours of Cork and the surrounding regions this summer. A large number of my readers are foodies so I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this could be of serious interest to some of you.</description>

Check out this story over on Lifehacker on how to peel a potato with you hands. Yet another piece of must-see pop culture from YouTube. I think I&amp;rsquo;m getting addicted to that site.
I have my doubts if it&amp;rsquo;d work with a good old fashioned Irish floury spud. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to try!

      <description>It had been thought that the sad passing of Peter Crowley, who had been the main driving force behind the setting up of a Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market in Bandon, would result in the plan being shelved. However, I was thrilled to read in the current edition of the Bandon Opinion that the organizing committee have not given up and Peter&amp;rsquo;s daughter is now involved.
The plan is for the market to take place in the Mace Carpark in the middle of town.</description>

To this end I&amp;rsquo;ll be creating a set of pseudo-duplicate posts over the next few days. Each pair will consist of an unstructured &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; post and a matching structured one.
Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be then able to feed the structured ones into some aggregators like kritX and this will provide us with a set of screenshots showing how you can go from randomly organised posts (e.</description>

He is getting 1000 impressions a day at PXN8 - that is damned impressive. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked it out, you really should. It allows you to edit pictures online including pictures you have stored over at Flickr. Can Photobox be far behind? You da bomb Walter.

Last week I called them a bag of spanners. This week it was &amp;ldquo;The Spannerettes&amp;rdquo;. A gaggle of gormless girls and only the crazy one was talking any sense. I was getting seriously worried as I found myself agreeing with everything Jo said.</description>

I have only just found out about Winter Food on RTE1 presented by Cork&amp;rsquo;s own Clodagh McKenna. I was very happy to see that recordings of the show (and archives) were available. Unfortunately there are a few problems, but I have solutions to some of them:

Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Coffee/Ice-Cream shop was the highlight of our walkabout in Killarney last Autumn. Fab coffee and stunning ice-cream. I just went with a simple double scoop of something fruity and Catherine went for one of their more complex creations.</description>

At this stage Oisín is totally cool with crustaceans, poor Sibéal was a bit shocked when I arrived back to the car with it.

He stayed in the cooler whilst we did the Skibbereen Winter Wonderland. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite Disney but the kids had a howl.</description>

      <description>Guinness has a blog. All the skinny at gapingvoid.
Looks like a pretty decent attempt at a corporate blog. They have a posting about great Guinness ads. One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve always hated about their web-site is that if you want to see their genius US ads instead of their dire &amp;ldquo;meaningful&amp;rdquo; Irish ones, you have to pretend to be in the US when signing in on the home page.

But one of the hinges on the DS broke recently. Looks like a design flaw to me (considering the new DS Lite has a much meatier hinge).</description>

      <description>And so on to attempt number three. This time I followed the advice of Podchef Neal and others regarding keeping everything as cold as possible when trying to mince the pork. So I stood outside for half an hour.
More usefully, I put the mincer attachment in the freezer for the day and used meat which had barely defrosted. Lo and behold, the meat flew through the mincer. I was using the coarsest holeage (I&amp;rsquo;m tired, I have no idea what the right term is for that) and so had to run the meat through again.</description>

      <description>In what I hope is the first of many by high-quality food producers in Ireland, Ummera Smoked Products have launched their own blog. You can find it over at ummera.wordpress.com.
Anthony seems really enthusiastic about using technology to enable him to do business more efficiently and I hope my (ahem) multitude of readers encourage him to keep blogging regularly by providing him with constant feedback. The big news on their blog is the new packaging/labelling which is a major improvement and really catches the eye on the shelf.</description>

      <description>The ability to search and find information in blog comments has been identified by many &amp;ldquo;in the know&amp;rdquo; as one of the bigger challenges in blogland in 2006. But I have a simpler problem - tracking replies to my comments on other peoples blogs. Those who use Wordpress and the &amp;ldquo;Subscribe to Comments&amp;rdquo; plug-in like me allow commenters to get e-mails when replies are posted. Unfortunately, we are in the minority.</description>

      <description>If I told you that the title of the programme should have the letters &amp;ldquo;Sh&amp;rdquo; at the start, you&amp;rsquo;d probably think I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very funny. Well that&amp;rsquo;s how funny &amp;ldquo;The IT Crowd&amp;rdquo; is. I wanted to give up after ten minutes but lasted to the end for the same reason people rubber-neck car crashes.
My six year old son reads me funnier knock-knock jokes from his &amp;ldquo;My first book of knock-knock jokes&amp;rdquo; than Graham Linehan came up with for this embarassment of a comedy.</description>

      <description>Big big thanks to Dirk over at Economy Size Geek. E-mails with picture attachments sent from my Nokia on the Vodafone Ireland network to this blog were not working with his plug-in. He says that the format from Vodafone is crazy. But he got it working! He is an absolute star for putting all of that effort in to get his code working for one user. Now I just need to get a phone that can take decent pictures&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Davida Tapas Bar - Reason enough to stop in Bandon</title>

      <description>A few Saturdays ago, myself and the worlds most understanding wife headed out to the new Tapas Bar in Bandon. I know, I know, you don&amp;rsquo;t often hear the words Tapas and Bandon in the same sentence, but bear with me.
Davida is in a fantastic location on Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Quay in Bandon looking out on the little river (the Bride?) rather than the Bandon itself. There are a few tables out the front for the warmer days and there is a heated area outside at the back too.</description>

      <description>Eating out in Derry on a Saturday night without a booking proved to be a bigger challenge than the NI Peace Process. Eoin&amp;rsquo;s unique understanding of local restaurant booking dynamics (all that chemical engineering process training didn&amp;rsquo;t go to waste) meant that most places quoted us up to two hours waiting time at around 8pm.
We put our names down in a few spots and retired to the pub for some pints.</description>

      <description>We pop in to McDonald&amp;rsquo;s in Roscrea on most trips from Bandon to Cavan. It is about half way and the kids are usually starving at that stage. It&amp;rsquo;s a wee bit small and parking is a hassle but it is one of the best run ones in the country. They have one of those &amp;ldquo;helper&amp;rdquo; people permanently on the floor mainly doing clean-up but also offering to mind kids if you need to order the food or go to the loo.</description>

      <description>We finally did it. Up to Derry to visit the Pierce&amp;rsquo;s. On the way up we over-nighted with Mary in Cavan and then arrived at Saturday lunchtime. Incredible location looking out over the Foyle. Great weekend.
On Sunday we braced ourselves for the return journey. There were three options - some bizarre route via Tuam suggested by AAIreland, via Dublin suggested by Eoin or back the way we came via Cavan.</description>

      <description>Congratulations to Myer&amp;rsquo;s Maxol Garage in Mitchelstown. Without doubt the most disgusting, undrinkable excuse for a cup of coffee we have ever bought. I have to wonder if they are using mud in the machine rather than coffeee beans. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some pretty dire coffee over the years. What some Greek cafes did to Nescafe when I was there in 1988 should be banned under the Geneva Convention but they were better than the thing we had yesterday.</description>

      <description>I just had a comment posted to my old blog by Kim on something I wrote about Bill Hicks back last May. She was stunned that I saw him live about a year before he died and wanted some details. It is odd timing that she posted now considering I&amp;rsquo;m just back from Austin. But I was also thinking about Bill when I was over there.
I was in the airport and spotted some Stevie Ray Vaughan CDs.</description>

      <description>I got back from the US on Sunday after a tortuous routing - if our feet didn&amp;rsquo;t actually touch the ground in St Louis, can we say we have been there? I was pretty much all beefed out (hope to god that is not some awful double entendre) after a Texan week. Catherine had spotted the Cully &amp;amp; Sully ready-meals in Supervalue and grabbed two to see what they were like.</description>

      <description>My old friend and classmate from college Dee Burke read my review of The Four Seasons and sent me her review of La Maison Troisgros in France. I asked if she&amp;rsquo;d mind if I posted it here due to the drooling all over the keyboard that resulted when I read it. She said sure. So, for the first time in the five years this blog has been in existence - a posting from someone other than Mr Creosote: &amp;gt; Peter had heard of &amp;ldquo;La Maison Troisgros&amp;rdquo; for the first time when he did a management course in the IMI years ago.</description>

      <description>We brought the rain with us from Cork and it lashed down as we were driven out to the Salt Lick BBQ which is, as they (and probably Ned Flanders) would put it &amp;ldquo;a heck of a long way out yonder&amp;rdquo;. It is also in a dry county where the sale (but not consumption) of alcohol is illegal. I think many of my Irish readers have probably had some sort of aneurysm reading that last sentence.</description>

      <description>Last time in Texas I was in a compact car. I was nearly crushed to death several times each day. This time, it was going to be fire with fire.
You lookin&amp;rsquo; at me? I said are you lookin at me?   
UPDATE: Goddammit, Baz was right. It is a poxing mini-van not an SUV (the sliding door is what gives it away). The locals were gentle with me and said it was kinda a minivan-SUV hybrid until one of em goes, &amp;ldquo;yeah, for soccer moms&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Yer, I want dat wun:
So we only got a massive SUV instead of a planet-sized one on our arrival in Texas. We&amp;rsquo;re here for the week and I hope I keep my wits about me and take plenty of Nokia Crap-cam pictures. The first one will be of our town runabout with three rows of seats and what sounds like a V6 under the bonnet. I spun the tyres when taking off gently from some traffic lights and squealed them every time I turned a corner.</description>

      <description>We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a &amp;ldquo;formal&amp;rdquo; family holiday in 2005 - a week in Rosslare
with the extended family was it for us. As year-end approached,
weariness grew. So we threw caution to the wind, threw the children to
their granny and headed down from Cavan to Capital City for some
pampering and unashamed luxury.

      <description>Few useful words for Network Operations in Eircom: Active/Passive Clusters, RAID, RAC, Multi-Pathing, Redundancy, 24*7*365 Network Monitoring, investment, SLA.
€33 per month ex-VAT for this? Next time Eircom, maybe don&amp;rsquo;t double the download speed, just halve the price.
This wasn&amp;rsquo;t just me, this was, in their words, &amp;ldquo;the Cork region&amp;rdquo;. Can anyone who has business broadband with Eircom in Cork confirm if they were down from midnight to 11.30am this morning?</description>

      <description>If anyone who worked for me ever attempted a double simultaneous software upgrade, I&amp;rsquo;d fire them. But as I&amp;rsquo;m the boss of me, I can do whatever I like on my blog. Last night I upgraded the blogging software to Wordpress 2.0 and moved the Blog Theme from Connections to Connections Reloaded. Huge kudos to Matt and Donncha and all the others at Wordpress for the trouble free upgrade and to Ajay for doing such a slick improvement to Connections.</description>

      <description>After walking quite quickly from the car to the office today in order to burn those extra 4 calories, I suffered slight dizziness at the bottom of the stairs with the thought of walking up them. Luckily I came to my senses and can now happily slob out for another 12 months.
The Unfit Comic Strip just gets better and better. This is a ripe time of the year for it.</description>

      <description>Ach, I hate giving bad reviews of places. I genuinely want every place I eat in to dazzle me. A few months back a new place opened in Bandon - &amp;ldquo;Jack O&amp;rsquo;Dwyer&amp;rsquo;s Diner&amp;rdquo;. It caught my eye instantly because I had only just been blogging about the dearth of fab and interesting burger joints in Ireland. Of course I was concerned that it would just be another crappy chipper with a bit of an image makeover but deep down I was really hoping that someone had had the vision to make a great diner in Bandon that would put the likes of the Eddie Rockets of the world in the shade.</description>

      <description>I have promised to blog the Ummera Smoked Eeel since the day I got it and I actually ate it about a week after receiving it in December. Before eating, I scanned all my cook books and the general consesus was that brown-bread, lemon and maybe horseradish were the things to eat it with. But Anthony of Ummera warned me not to over-do it with extra flavours so I took it easy.</description>

      <description>For one very scary moment, I thought we had accidentally rented out a special Australian Edition of &amp;ldquo;Batman Begins&amp;rdquo; redubbed with Sir Les Patterson as Batman, Dame Edna Everage as Rachel Dawes and Michael Caine as Alfred (oh, wait a sec).
Luckily we found Ireland somewhere around Latvia. This had Twink as Rachel Dawes&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..

      <description>Surprise hit movie of the Christmas period with our gang was Madagascar. They have to give those penguins their own movie.
Oh and Happy New Year too. We&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to the stage where we don&amp;rsquo;t really notice a new year rolling in. We were all in bed before 12, shivering under our covers because we ran out of home heating oil. Coal, we love you.

      <description>A big Merry Christmas to all my readers, most of whom are currently co-located with me in the sitting room in Kilkenny. We&amp;rsquo;re having a grand old time in Kilk. All of us are down now except for Emer&amp;rsquo;s gang who will arrive tomorrow morning. We&amp;rsquo;ve just assembled the various christmas presents and all of the kids are happily asleep having dreams of Mario Kart DS, Barbie Scooters, Leapad Walkers and Power Rangers.</description>

      <description>I installed the Performancing extension for Firefox yesterday. It is a blogging add-on and I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post in it. Looks pretty good except I don&amp;rsquo;t see any handling of Wordpress categories. If this feature does not exist or is not coming soon, I won&amp;rsquo;t continue to use it. From a basic UI perspective it seems fine tho. And it&amp;rsquo;ll handle multiple blogs. More as I investigate. Aha, found the categories tab, excellent.</description>

But, YSNRY 1985 is finally with us just in time for christmas. This is the latest in a very very special (to Speccy fanatics like myself) series of animated &amp;ldquo;movies&amp;rdquo; about the hey-day years of &amp;lsquo;Your Sinclair/Your Spectrum&amp;rsquo; magazine, an esteemed journal which published two games by yours truly back in 1985&amp;frasl;1986!</description>

      <description>Sadly, attempt #2 at sausage making was not a big success. Not quite Null Points but definitely at the Norwegian end of the Eurovision chipolta contest.
I actually did it a few weeks ago for the parents coming over for brunch but I&amp;rsquo;m only getting around to blogging it now.
I defrosted the meat that I had not used the last time and spent a hell of a long time on preparation.</description>

Poor Ois nearly had a heart attack when the guy in the shop leaped towards him with the lobster in his hand! Oscar just wanted to know how I was going to kill it. That kid worries me sometimes.
So here he is, just home, Spongebob.

But over the past year I have been watching what Hugh McLeod has been doing with the idea of The Global Microbrand. Hugh is most famous for using blogging to create worldwide interest and demand for the products of a Saville Row tailor.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t want this blog to turn into a list of great people who have died, but I&amp;rsquo;ve just read that Richard Pryor has passed away.
There is an excellent obituary on the Washington Post site.
Lovely quotes on Yahoo.
And if you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard him at his foul-mouthed best, you can listen to some clips on Amazon- hell go buy the box set whilst you are at it.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just cooked up the smoked rashers that Catherine got in Urru during the week. They were gorgeous. I was surprised when I opened the pack to see that it did not contain a few thick rashers but lots of very thinly cut ones. This is exactly the way I like them - I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a fan of those thick cut things which often end up a chewy as old boots.</description>

      <description>My first employer was S3, who are 90% owned by Philips in The Netherlands. As a result,I spent quite a bit of time in Eindhoven, where the HQ is based. Big hello to the Eindhoven posse (Mark)!
The Inquirer has an short article on the death of the son of the founder of Philips at the age of 100. They mention what he was in charge of in his heyday. The same name was on a giant sign which you passed in the train on the way into the city from Amsterdam.</description>

      <description>I was gutted to read in CAR that LJK Setright passed away recently. I started reading CAR when I was 14 years old and continue to do so despite his absence for the past few years.
As a kid, I checked out most of the motoring magazines and CAR was the only one I read where I felt I was learning something, rather than just reading pseudo-ads. For a short while in the late 80&amp;rsquo;s I tried Performance Car but to be honest that was only because of Clarkson.</description>

I have no idea where he is talking about and Googling only brings up the actual McCarthy&amp;rsquo;s Bar in Castletownbere.</description>

The SuperValu in the town has a small fish counter but you can never rely on it to have anything you want.</description>

I also got the latest GG Telecom GG03a Bluetooth headset from them. This is Bluetooth 1.2 compatible, but more importantly can be paired to up to three devices. So with a quick button press, I can switch it from working with the Nokia mobile to pairing with the laptop to pairing with the work desktop.</description>

He did well on the present front and has just spent the past hour opening them and enthusing in the way that only he can do.

More importantly, I have setup the &amp;ldquo;Subscribe-to-Comments&amp;rdquo; plug-in. So now if you add a comment, you can get notified by e-mail if someone else replies. It saves you having to constantly re-check.</description>

      <description>Not that anyone cares other than those who have to look at me, but I managed to drop a stone (14 fluid ounces in US measurements and 3 kilopascals in metric) in the past 4 weeks. Only 28 more pounds to go. Targeting another stone by Christmas but that is probably unrealistic. With the money I have saved from not drinking, I&amp;rsquo;m buying myself a new Ford Mustang.

      <description>Usually I&amp;rsquo;m on the ball when it comes to great new TV shows. I&amp;rsquo;m also incredibly modest and humble. I&amp;rsquo;ve been raving about &amp;ldquo;Curb&amp;rdquo; since I watched it on DVD before it was shown here. But I completely let &amp;ldquo;Arrested Development&amp;rdquo; slip past me. I used hear about the awards and how funny it was but never got round to checking it out.
About two months ago I finally set it to record on the Sky+.</description>

      <description>The speakers on the Acer Laptop are a bit puny, particularly for playing DVDs. Unfortunately, the machine does not have a line out, so I decided to get a pair of USB speakers. I didn&amp;rsquo;t need anything particularly special and they had to be just a bog-standard stereo pair due to lack of space. A bit of browsing on Dabs brought up thePhilips DGX220 Speakers at a nice n cheap &amp;pound;23.</description>

      <description>None of my recent posts were appearing on Planet of the Blogs and I assumed they were doing something wrong. So I finally mailed them today and they were able to suss that my RSS feeds were all buggered. Why? Because I cannot read simple bloody instructions. I wanted to change from the normal Wordpress link style for posts (e.g. http://conoroneill.com/?p=178) to a more meaningful permalink structure (http://conoroneill.com/2005/11/17/pork-from-china/). What did I do?</description>

      <description>I set up Google Analytics and AdSense on this web-site for no real reason other than messin. Watching the ads that appear could become a full-time hobby.
Most of them are as expected - &amp;ldquo;Holidays in Donegal or Galway&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few &amp;ldquo;buy sausages and herbs from us&amp;rdquo;. But one made me do a click-thru on my own site: &amp;ldquo;Buy Pork&amp;rdquo;.
Hmm interesting. Then I read the detail of the site a little closer, &amp;ldquo;Buy Pork from China&amp;rdquo;!</description>

      <description>I shouldn&#39;t laugh, I really shouldn&#39;t, but I&#39;m pretty sure the only Baptist church in Bandon is the one just near our house. [Baptist pastor charged over bank robbery](http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0806/cork.html?rss) If only we&#39;d gone to his coffee morning, this could all have been avoided. The fact that the BOI Bank Manager lives beside the Baptist Church too sends this story into the realms of the completely bizarre.  UPDATE 15/11/2005: They gave the poor sod a suspended sentence.</description>

      <description>Last Saturday, the world was my oyster. Wife n kids were in Cavan, house to myself, I could do anything I liked. Except I&amp;rsquo;m off booze so getting blotto was out of the question, I&amp;rsquo;m on a diet so a huge steak n chips was off the menu and I hate sport so a day of Premiership football would be torture. But I was still totally buzzed about making sausages after the Hugh Fearnley-Wearnley-Guernley Course in Ballymaloe.</description>

      <description>We spent the halloween weekend down in Rosslare. I know it is now a mini-Dublin but it&amp;rsquo;s a perfect spot for all of the extended family to meet up. There is one shop I want to mention simply because they deserve to be much better known. &amp;ldquo;Kate&amp;rsquo;s Farm Shop&amp;rdquo; is just off the Duncannon Roundabout towards Duncannon. I found it accidentally during the summer when I went for a &amp;ldquo;lets get the kids to sleep for a hour&amp;rdquo; drive.</description>

      <description>After Caroline&amp;rsquo;s wedding, we hung on for another day in Killarney to get a break from our four darlings. I think maybe I had passed through once before but could remember nothing of the place so I had no expectations. OK, I did assume we would find a certain level of paddywhackery but jesus, it turned out to be Brigadoon transplanted.

I have never ever seen so many shops selling such tat in all my life.</description>

      <description>Edward Twomey was Mr Clonakilty Black Pudding. I was sad to read in my local Bandon Opinion last week that he had passed away. The story of Edward and his pudding is one that I think very few people know.
Since I started eating out, I have often run into Clonakilty Black Pudding on menus. I have also seen many articles raving about it. But until I moved to Bandon, I honestly thought that it was a general description for all pudding from the town.</description>

      <description>The war on weight continues and I am debating whether to start a weekly post on the Bloggers Belly Bulkometer. Half a stone in a week is not bad going. Those couple of bottles of wine and cans of Becks each week were obviously contributing _slightly _to the inexorable move towards Rick Waller territory.
Tonight will be a major trial. Curry with brown rice, no naans and no booze in the house on my own.</description>

      <description>Way back in 1999, I was on a week long training course in Stanford which had been arranged by Enterprise Ireland. It was a fabulous week and I learned a hell of a lot about entrepreneurship, the mindset of Silicon Valley and what the hell VC was all about.
But the best bits of the trip were the site visits to various companies. Some were rubbish; Cisco sent in their Software Configuration Manager to tell us about version control.</description>

      <description>The long awaited day finally arrived last saturday. For my Christmas present last year, the world&amp;rsquo;s best wife got me a place at Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Pig in A Day&amp;rdquo; course in Ballymaloe Cookery School. I hared it over to Shanagarry early on Saturday and arrived just in time.
In my gormless naivete, I thought it would be an up-close-and-personal session with maybe 6-10 people. It never struck me that this was not financially feasible.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really hitting the limit of my thirty words of German. Until recently, my experience of German cuisine has been limited to halbe-hanchen mit frites, Curry Wurst and Kartoffelklösse. And ya know, when booze is involved, there is nothing better. But as I mentioned in my recent review, Otto has changed my view of German cooking forever.
Last weekend caused me to add several inches to my girth when the parents took me out on Friday and then they baby-sat on Saturday so myself and Catherine could go out.</description>

      <description>Bless me father for I have sinned. It has been four years since my last Citroën.
My first car was a Citroën BX which I bought off my sister for &amp;pound;2000 in about 1992. A complete and utter piece of crap. God I loved that car. A month after I bought it, I discovered the front sub-frame was rusted through and needed to be replaced. That cost over a grand and after that the car sat pointing towards the sky.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago I spotted a sign near our house for &amp;ldquo;All Ireland Harness Racing&amp;rdquo; in Barryroe, about 10 miles down towards the coast. I had missed a lot of the local events in the latter part of the summer, so I figured this might be a bit of fun for us all to check out.
We headed down with C&amp;amp;T following in their car. Just as we were about to fall into the Atlantic, we turned into a huge field which, according to my map, is very near the townland of Turkeyland.</description>

      <description>I was recently out on a business dinner with some Dutch customers to &amp;ldquo;Man Fridays&amp;rdquo; in Kinsale. This appears to be one of the most famous restaurants in Kinsale and is nestled in a fabulous location overlooking the harbour. Parking in that part of Kinsale was, as ever, a nightmare. I eventually strapped two dinghys to my car and moored it off the promenade.
Overall I was very disappointed with the food but the Dutch guys loved it, so go figure.</description>

The Servisair genius at check-in put us in three separate rows. She was either as thick as two short planks or bitter over her fabulous career. Either way, Catherine had Fionn, I had Ois &amp;amp; Shibs and poor Oscar had to sit on his own for take-off.</description>

Discoverers of H.Pylori get Nobel Prize
This is fantastic. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the treatment and unfortunately it appears I am in the 10% for whom the little bastard bacteria are not the problem. My problem is more likely to be Curry, Coffee and Sauvignon Blanc.
The discovery that Helicobacter Pylori is responsible for the majority of stomach ulcers is often used by the alternative medicine brigade to beat up &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; medicine.</description>

      <description>Now listen carefully. Don Adams, who played Maxwell Smart in one of the best shows of my youth has died aged 82. The show actually aired from 1965 to 1970 in the US but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it until well into the 70&amp;rsquo;s. A very very silly series which I will never forget.
I cannot walk through any building with more than two swing doors in sequence without that tune starting in my head duh duh duh duuuuuuh, duh duh duh duuuuh&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Maria, our summer student, finished up on Friday. We bounced around a few ideas for nosh and settled on something we figured everyone would like - Scoozi&amp;rsquo;s on Winthrop Ave just near the GPO in Cork.
Great buzz in the place on arrival and no delay getting seated (well it was 5.30 on a Friday). A bit disappointed that there was no beer on the menu - I had imagined big jugs of the stuff in the middle of the table.</description>

      <description>The parents are in Spain and my mother gave me a shout to see if I wanted anything whilst she was there. The last time she got me a fab selection of Chorizo and Salami which I am still working through. So I just asked for the same again. But I also asked her if she would keep her eye out for Smoked Paprika - the main flavour in Chorizo. Fiona failed to find it on her last trip and I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to think that someone will have to find a spice emporium over there.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp; Update 19/09/2005: I had left out a few steps on this originally, so I&#39;m re-publishing. I have a recipe for Meatballs with Tomato Sauce which is based mainly on Sophie Grigson&#39;s recipe in her Meat Course Book. That is one of the best Cookbooks of the past few years but sadly is out of print now. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&#39;s River Cottage Meat Book is a pretty good alternative for carnivores. My family rave about this meal when I cook it and I have to admit to being partial to it myself.</description>

      <description>The BBC has an article on the most recent study of Homeopathy showing, yet again, that it is no better than placebo.
Whilst I consider most alternative therapies to be rubbish being pushed by idiots and charlatans, Homeopathy has managed to inhabit that grey zone where one doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to completely dismiss it. This was down to a few factors - the fact that it has been around for a long time, the fact that they do seem to get some form of results and finally the desire of those who have followed a formal course of study to be officially recognised and to not allow actual charlatans to calls themselves homeopaths.</description>

      <description>My bottle of Stormhoek Sauvignon Blanc 2005 from the gapingvoid freebie arrived by courier this evening. I was going to wait until tomorrow to review but one dead linux server has fast-tracked the opening.

It uses a screw-cap which I support 100% for Sauvignons. I am sick to the back teeth of getting ruined bottles of Sancerre and Pouilly Fumé with their crappy corks.
On opening, a bit of a sniff tells me that it is along the same lines as other South African Sauvignons and not like the Marlborough ones.</description>

      <description>I have a small obsession with getting my knives very sharp. I think it goes back to my uncle Frank who is a carpenter and who showed me how he sharpened his chisels on a wet-stone when I was a very small kid. From that point on, I was always trying to sharpen knives. I think my first attempt was using Frank&amp;rsquo;s wet-stone on a butter knife. The outcome on that one was very predictable.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be able to put into proper words how fantastic the meal in OCC in Dunworley was last night. We just can&amp;rsquo;t stop talking about it. Perfection from start to finish. But first some history:
When we moved to Bandon two years ago, I asked around about good restaurants in the area. The general consensus was that none of the ones in Bandon were great but that Otto&amp;rsquo;s in Dunworley was fantastic.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Wordpress Categories as sort of generic Technorati tags. When I remember, I add some post-specific actual tags. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been that clear on the difference to be honest.
Lorelle has a big posting on it. And I&amp;rsquo;m still confused!
Top-tip: Don&amp;rsquo;t try reading anything technical after spending your lunchtime installing Oracle and testing ETL tools. Maybe I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try setting up an automated backup of a subversion repository this afternoon after all.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always found the name of &amp;ldquo;Cafe Mao&amp;rdquo; offensive. I ate there once - mediocre at best. They are probably as good at cooking food as Mao was at growing it. In my little fantasy world, I&amp;rsquo;d love to set up a little stall outside of the Cafe and sell Pol Pot Noodles. Wonder how long before someone would complain?
As ever, someone else expresses this thought so much better than I can.</description>

      <description>The Honda Goldwing Owners Club had their annual Treffen in Bandon last weekend. It was a thrill to see so many fabulous bikes from all over Europe around the town. I could make a crack about the fact that the owners all seemed to be overweight middle-aged men, but as I now fall firmly in that category, I shall desist.
They did a parade on Saturday afternoon and we caught them on the return leg as they headed back to the camp in the GAA pitch.</description>

      <description>Finally, 5 years after registering conoroneill.com and just having it re-direct to geocities, eircom and blogspot (in that order), I am now properly hosted with PowWeb. The value for money they were offering made it an easy decision. The import of the Blogspot Blog went disasterously badly yesterday as I did it on the latest 1.5.2 version of Wordpress which the importer did not like. Tonight I reverted to 1.5.1.2, did the import and then did the upgrade and it all worked swimmingly.</description>

I have yet to decide whether to use something free like [Blogsome ](http://www.blogsome.com/)or get hosted with a wordpress.org recommended Host like [PowWeb](http://powweb.com/) or an Irish host like [Blacknight](http://www.blacknight.ie/). If anyone has opinions on these alternatives, I&#39;d be very interested in hearing them. If the Irish option is reasonable, I&#39;d obviously prefer to go with that.</description>

      <description>I finally got to see [Bubba Ho-Tep](http://www.bubbahotep.com/) recently. What an odd but completely beguiling movie. I sat down to watch it with a bunch of pre-conceptions and expectations. A low-budget ($500K) movie starring Bruce Campbell as Elvis and Ossie Davis as JFK fighting a mummy in an Old Folk&#39;s home in East Texas - how could you not have ideas as to what sort of movie it would be? I spent a summer in Stuttgart during college working in an old folk&#39;s home.</description>

      <description>To quote the great Bill Hicks. Yesterday I tried to create a new classic instant meal. I decided to traverse the extremes from MSG to Midleton by creating a masterpiece consisting of Koka Chicken &#34;flavoured&#34; Noodles, leftover sausages and Organic Rocket Pesto from the Midleton Farmers market. Oh dear, won&#39;t be having that again. A fuzzy Nokia crap-cam picture of the gourmet extavaganza: [![noodles](http://photos21.flickr.com/33867746_eb14c76efc_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/33867746/ &#34;Photo Sharing&#34;) Next week, I will give details of the current greatest instant meal of all time which I have eaten since I was a kid: Heinz Spaghetti Hoops nestling on a bed of processed ham delicately covered in a layer of grated cheddar with optional Chef Brown Sauce.</description>

Hope they give me some Sauvignon Blanc. New Zealand Marlborough Sauvignon is pretty much all we drink but we have got some good bottles of South African Sauvignon recently which are far far better than anything coming out of Chile.</description>

      <description>We are very happy to announce our early alpha re-launch of our company web-site as a Wordpress blog. We hope that releasing before completion will accelerate it&#39;s development. The main point of re-structuring as a blog is to try and create a community forum for discussing Enterprise Systems, in particular Enterprise Storage Software and Systems. Ideally many of those working in the Irish divisions of storage companies such as EMC, Dell, StorageTek, SUN etc will take advantage of the site and put an Irish spin on the discussions.</description>

      <description>A wee bit delayed, we are tickled pink to announce the birth of Chloe Sheila Johnston on June 30th in the Coombe to Louise and Kieran. The little darling weighed in at 6lbs 15oz, so our young fella should be easily able to bully her. Kieran has decided to forego a property development empire to set up a hedge fund trading in pampers futures. It appears there is far more money to be made in nappies.</description>

      <description>I have finally uploaded some photos of the wee mite to Flickr. He is now feeding on 1oz an hour which we are going to have to fix pronto. Oscar and Oisín completely relaxed about the whole thing. Poor Sibéal a bit put-out but being very good really. Any chance of weather somewhere between lashing rain and scorched earth?

      <description>30 years of bombings by IRA scum achieved nothing. Mass murderers like Martin Ferris may think that cowardly bombings in places like Warrington were different to what happened last week. Civilized people know there is no difference between the actions of Irish fascists and Islamo-Fascists. These words from a Londoner say it all: [A Letter To The Terrorists, From London](http://www.lnreview.co.uk/news/005167.php) Amen brother.

      <description>We are now 23 hours and 35 minutes away from Catherine being induced in the Bons. We still haven&#39;t figured out if it is inducement or induction and we are having last minute hesitations about the name we have picked for him. We had decided on Cavan O&#39;Neill but my mother objected and thought we should compromise on Navan O&#39;Neill. Babba was 9lbs last week. I don&#39;t even want to think what weight he is now.</description>

      <description>Burger Blogs seem to be appearing everywhere but this guy [Two-Twenty](http://www.two-twenty.net/archives/000378.html) is an animal! It turns out that Anthony Bourdain&#39;s Les Halles restaurant does burgers too. Bourdain became famous because of his book &#34;Kitchen Confidential&#34; which gave the low-down on the high-jinks in a restaurant kitchen. A great read. His &#34;Cook&#39;s Tour&#34; follow-up was less hyped but also a very good read. The associated TV series was pretty poor. His &#34;</description>

      <description>Aged 22, Patrick died in his sleep last monday night. He was buried at Shanganagh Cemetery yesterday after a heart-breaking funeral mass in Shankill. I didn&#39;t know Patrick that well, I met him maybe once or twice a year when visiting Eoin and Jill. But the short life of this young man should be celebrated as a example of achievement in the face of overwhelming adversity. Nine years ago, Patrick was hit by a car and suffered massive head trauma.</description>

      <description>The first 3 years of this blog consisted almost entirely of baby announcements for my friends. I guess to be consistent it should also let friends know about those who have passed away. It is obviously a bit clueless to claim that the internet (and blogs in particular) democratises the news but I have to admit that I only buy a newspaper now on Friday, Saturday and Sunday - Friday for the jobs section, Saturday for the food/property section in De Paper and Sunday for the TV bit of the Sunday Times.</description>

      <description>One of the best foodie blogs out there is[ A Hamburger Today](http://www.ahamburgertoday.com/). The writing is top class and the enthusiasm for the food shines through. But it has got me thinking about the complete lack of burger variety in this country. There seems to the only three categories here - Mickey D&#39;s Style (incl Burger King, Super Macs etc), Chippers (insert your local chipper name here) and diners (Eddie Rockets being the only example I can think of).</description>

I have seen references to Wordpress constantly on blogs and for some reason never checked it out, which is totally out of character for a click-junkie like me. But I was getting frustrated with Blogger and the difficulty in customising it and started looking around.</description>

      <description>Forget 100K for Celebrity Love Island; Oscar finally got the 10 Euro for his first place in Juniors/Seniors writing in the Bandon Show. The following is an exceprt from his winning entry:&amp;ldquo;Pine nut, which is a nut, but it&amp;rsquo;s also the name of a town. Pistachio nut. Red pistachio nut. Natural, all natural white pistachio nut.&amp;rdquo;

This balanced his unfortunate lack of awards at the Crossmahon Sports day yesterday. The competition in the Senior Infants category was just too tough and his mid-placing in both running and muscial chairs may have scarred him for life.</description>

I catch a bit of AM Kelly on Today FM on the way in to work. Jesus, does she ever play anything other than bland innofensive soporific music? Fair enough at 4am but something a little more noisy at 6.45 to stop me snoozing off and ploughing into the nearest tractor would help.

      <description>As a good husband, I am empathising with my pregnant wife by attempting to grow a belly as big as hers. So far, it has been a resounding success. However, it does pose issues of aesthetics when heading to the beach for what is likely to be the only hot day this year that we had last Sunday.
Myself and the three squirts headed off to the Long Strand in Castlefreke/Rathbarry (how could they get rid of such a hilarious name for a village and replace it with something so insipid?</description>

      <description>Damn - Great actress. Still looking stunning even last year. She was great in the final episode of the last series of &amp;ldquo;Curb&amp;rdquo; with Mel Brooks. They cast Larry in &amp;ldquo;The Producers&amp;rdquo; so that it would be a flop but it all back-fired. Beautiful recursion.
But I have to admit to never seeing all of &amp;ldquo;The Graduate&amp;rdquo;. What a Philistine.

      <description>Just wasted 2 hours of my life watching &amp;ldquo;Closer&amp;rdquo;. What a steaming turd of a movie. Why do they make films about people who you just want to die within 10 minutes of the opening scene?
Not a great weekend of movies. &amp;ldquo;Meet the Fockers&amp;rdquo; was desperately disappointing - how lazy were they to blow the opportunity of having Hoffman and Streisand on the screen together? And &amp;ldquo;Ocean&amp;rsquo;s 12&amp;rdquo; was only passable.</description>

Not only is this just an awesome idea for a wet miserable June Bank Holiday Sunday but it also makes me think back maybe 30 years ago to when my grandaunts down in &#34;The Boola&#34; in Adamstown in Wexford used to make butter. I still remember the ridged wooden paddles they used to form the butter and how gorgeous everything they fed us was (those eggs, mmmmmm).</description>

      <description>We specialise in giving our kids names that either can&amp;rsquo;t be pronounced outside of Ireland (Oisín), can&amp;rsquo;t be pronounced inside of Ireland (Sibéal - or Sibín as the Health Board thinks she is called) or make people go &amp;ldquo;ah, named after X?&amp;rdquo; (Oscar - actually named after the Sesame Street character). Child number 4 is in serious trouble.
This post has some interesting ones worth considering. Follow the link to Google.</description>

      <description>Bloody vending machine in work is only taking exact change so I could only get a Smarties bar. But this is no ordinary Smarties bar - it&amp;rsquo;s an &amp;ldquo;exploding one&amp;rdquo;!Massive flashbacks going on here. What the hell was the name of that sweet crystalline stuff in a bag that you shook on to your tongue in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s and it exploded all over it? it&amp;rsquo;s the same stuff. Hurrah, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a disco on my tongue.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought I was a dead ringer for Wally in appearance if not behaviour. Today&amp;rsquo;s Dilbert has &amp;ldquo;Milt&amp;rdquo;, a married man.
It&amp;rsquo;s me I tell you, it&amp;rsquo;s me.
I need to lie down now - yesterday was both Oscar&amp;rsquo;s and Catherine&amp;rsquo;s birthday.
27 kids in KidzKlub going mental. I was exhausted just trying to remember their names.

      <description>Another reason to like JWZ - he is a Bill Hicks fan too by the looks of things.
The good always die young. Saw him live once when he played Dublin about a year before he died. He was on his anti-smoking kick at that stage (too late obviously) which to be honest wasn&amp;rsquo;t half as funny as his pro-smoking rants. &amp;ldquo;Non-Smokers die&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;every day&amp;rdquo;.
Painful irony.

      <description>The job scene is Cork seems very strange to me (coming from working 11 years in Dublin). I hear complaints about the lack of tech jobs down here but at the same time we are having severe problems getting CVs from contractors for Argolon Solutions. To date we have done a Monster ad, an Examiner ad and mentioned openings on this blog and we have received a tiny number of CVs in response.</description>

      <description>Oisin O&amp;rsquo;Neill (3) of Old Chapel Bandon, registered his utter disgust this past Sunday over the non-appearence of elephants at the 2005 Bandon Summer Agricultural show. Proceedings have been served on Conor O&amp;rsquo;Neill (37), also of Old Chapel Bandon, for mis-leading advertising regarding the nature of the beasts which would appear at the show. Disappontment was also expressed over the lack of tigers.
On a positive note, none of the attending O&amp;rsquo;Neill family had ever seen bulls that large despite the elder family members having seen calves born in the farm across the road in Ratoath in 1972 at the age of 4.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re off to the Bandon Show in an hour or so. The last time I was at anything like this I must have been in my mid-teens and my parents took me on the annual pilgrimage to The Spring Show in the RDS.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t help myself. I know they are world&amp;rsquo;s easiest targets. Twenty Major had tears rolling down my face talking about what a pair of utter mingers they are.
But then I found the lyrics - dear god, is English even his first language? &amp;ldquo;Love can make you happy, love can make you cry&amp;rdquo;?
Coincidentally, I found this site which sings lyrics for you. So I entered the first verse. A massive improvement I think you&amp;rsquo;ll agree.</description>

Just looking through the features - bloody hell, I can see why people are raving about it. Can upload pictures via email, so I can send direct from my camera phone to Flickr. Can get it to automatically post the pictures to my blog, so straight from camera phone to blog.</description>

      <description>Baby Announcements!! We just found out that Maria and Maurice had a baby girl back on April 17th. Baby Ellen is an absolute cutie and either has dark red hair or bright red hair depending on whether you ask Claire or Ethna. Oh, and the Pierce&#39;s finally named 3 of 9: Rianna Gail Pierce. That&#39;s a very cool name. I&#39;d nick it only for the fact that our next one is a bloke.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to record streaming audio so I can listen to it later (and start/stop when I like). Actually it&#39;s specifically for [The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy Quandary Phase](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/). I didn&#39;t really enjoy the last radio series and the repeats of the TV series aren&#39;t that great either. But it became a technical challenge that I wanted to get to the bottom of. I finally cracked it today.</description>

      <description>Ah yes, those Sheraton folks in Massachusetts really know their architecture. Our hotel was only bettered by the one we drove under which straddled the Massachusetts Turnpike. I&#39;ve always wanted a room with cars whizzing past 20 feet under my floor. Shopping disaster - only had time for Toys R Us. Kids happy even if I&#39;m still without a new keyboard and mouse. On the other hand, we had some very successful meals.</description>

      <description>Well it was obvious since Paul was fired but what a disappointment. Tim has not excelled once in the entire series of [The Apprentice](http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/). Can you think of one thing he did where you went &#34;wow&#34;? The series for me consists of some great scenes involving Paul, James and Saira. But maybe that&#39;s what Sugar wants - an average MOR guy who won&#39;t challenge him and will do what he is told.</description>

      <description>I bought my first soldering iron and multimeter by mail-order from Maplin when I was about 16 (1984) to build some add-ons for my ZX Spectrum. None of my creations ever worked :-( I still have the soldering iron. I finally retired the analogue multimeter only last week after 21 years of sterling service and replaced it with a no-name digital one that I picked up in B&amp;Q for &amp;euro;25. I spent 6 years in UCD studying Electronic Engineering.</description>

Put in [www.conoroneill.com](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://conoroneill.com) and it gives old snapshots of my web-site going back to 2001\. You can never leave your mistakes behind. I was disappointed tho that the old Integral Design web-site was never archived.

The RSS feed is kinda irrelevant for oneself but I suppose if someone was stalking me, they might be interested in what sites I am interested in and what tags I put on them. I take back what I said about tags in my previous Bloglines post below - they are actually handy for finding stuff by category (like GMail).</description>

      <description>No more Princess Bride quotes I&#39;m afraid. Sam entered a world-class poem into a Gerry Ryan Pot Noodle competition today. Unfortunately she was not selected to go on air (unlike her last piece of genius which was up there with T.S. Eliot and she got to read out to the listening public). So, in order to give it the publicity it deserves, here it is in it&#39;s entirety. **The Pot heads**   We are from the planet Noodle, We cannot write, we scribble and doodle.</description>

      <description>We don&#39;t have it too bad for restaurants down here in Cork. We&#39;ve had great meals in Gleesons in Clonakilty, Casino House in Kilbrittain and Broly&#39;s in Bandon. Unfortunately most of the places in Bandon target the lower end of the Market and it&#39;s nice to see Broly&#39;s trying something better. It is a coffee shop/cafe during the day and they re-jig for more upmarket dinner at night. Good tasty food.</description>

      <description>OK-bleedin-Computer? How stupid is the average Channel 4 viewer? Fat-bloated-prog-rock-whinge-fest pap voted the greatest album of all time? Maybe it isn&#39;t so shocking when you learn that they also voted The Verve (the Verve!) higher than Jimi Hendrix, The Smiths, The Stone Roses and The Doors. What can be the cause of the destruction of the brain stems of the average British TV viewer? Cocaine? E? Fluoride? Tony Blair? PS2? I despair.</description>

      <description>We are nearly a week into our Sky+ Box ownership. It&#39;s not often something far exceeds your expectation but this bloody thing does so with ease. The wee beauty can record two channels at the same time. There is some very impressive buffer management going on in there. We have set a bunch of recordings of weekly shows plus any movies that catch my eye no matter what time they start.</description>

      <description>Finally got around to collecting together the list of other bits of software I use (mainly at home). But first off, I should be given a thorough thrashing for not including XEmacs in the first list. I first encountered XEmacs on HP-UX in Philips Eindhoven in 1995\. Up until then I had used the VAX editor and a few crappy freeware PC ones. This thing was a revelation - syntax highlighting, tons of extensions, call-out to make, gcc, whatever.</description>

      <description>Nostalgia time, 80&#39;s fans. Due to unprecedented public demand (currently at zero requests), I am making available my classic ZX Spectrum games at no cost. Each of these 4K masterpieces, which took months of pubescent angst to complete, requires either an actual ZX Spectrum or an emulator to play. My two favourite emulators are [EmuZWin](http://bonanzas.rinet.ru/apps/EmuZWin_Eng.htm) and [ZXSpin](http://www.zxspin.co.uk/). The current version of ZXSpin seems to have some problem finding ROMs so maybe stick with EmuZWin for the moment.</description>

      <description>I was watching The Princess Bride for the gazillionth time the other night and had forgotten how many great one liners it has. So the next few postings are all going to have completely unrelated titles from that movie. Last year I bought a Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350 video capture card. The main reason was to transfer an ancient (vintage 1980) family video to DVD and also to transfer all our Sony HandyCam Video-8 to DVD.</description>

      <description>I never got into the US version of The Apprentice. I think mainly because I&#39;ve always thought of Trump as a tacky buffoon. I remember being brought to Trump Towers in 1987 by my American cousin (whirlwind tour of NY in one day including WTC, St Patrick&#39;s Cathederal and The Statue of Liberty) and thinking - how can you spend so much money and end up with a place looking so cheap?</description>

I decided to write a list of all of the tools I definitely needed to install on it in addition to the corporate installs. I assumed it it would be 10 or 15\. Bloody hell, more like 40\.

When we had stayed in Clonea Strand Hotel, there had been a lot of shouting and banging in the middle of the night for about 20 minutes.</description>

      <guid>https://conoroneill.com/2005/03/17/bloglines-vs-feedonfeeds/</guid>
      <description>So I&#39;ve been using an RSS Aggregator called [FeedonFeeds](http://feedonfeeds.com/) for a long time now. The reason I&#39;ve always liked it is that it is server based and caches the data in a MySQL DB. I have it installed on the Fedora box at home and can connect to it via the DSL connection from anywhere. So I have one centralised location for all my feeds. The caching is also handy as I found a lot of the older aggregators would only cache the titles and not any of the content, and for sites that turnover their RSS links quickly, a lot of the items used to be gone by the time I&#39;d try to read them.</description>

      <description>We spent Saturday in and around Dungarvan visiting Catherines cousin Maria. They live near Clonea Strand which is a fantastic beach. Myself and the boys whiled away an hour or two digging holes and filling them with stones. We stayed in the [Clonea Strand Hotel](http://www.clonea.com) - a good mid-market place with some fantastic (non-ironic) 70&#39;s interiors. Big high ceilings and open stairs. Beds could do with replacing but a top spot with great kids facilities.</description>

      <description>Well the wee fetus has turned out to be a boy. We had the 21-week scan yesterday and even I could tell it was a bloke! He is slightly above average weight and all looks perfect. A couple of scans will be posted soon (including a High-5 which is pretty neat). Ois and Osc are thrilled &#34;So that&#39;ll be 4 boys and only 2 girls in the house. Brilliant!&#34;. Names we have come up with so far to annoy my mother include Cavan, Mossie, Moses and Cruz.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s not often I comment on a wedding but last weekends wedding of Ciarán and Heather was absolutely brilliant. From the lovely church in Tinahely to the beautifal location for the reception in Ballybeg House to the phenomenal catering, great crowd, top atmosphere and razor sharp speeches, we all left with huge grins on our faces. Of course I&#39;m now getting flashbacks of the picture shown by Eoin O&#39;B of Ciarán in First Year Eng with his German &#39;tache.</description>

      <description>My younger sister Orla gave birth to her first child last Saturday around 7.30 am. Hannah Rose is a wee titch, weighing in at a little over 6 lbs. She is an absolute stunner and all are well and at home already. Nana Rose is allegedly chuffed that all her granddaughters have Rose as their middle name. Our boys are now totally confused with two cousin Hannah&#39;s. This summer should be fun with all the girly cousins on holidays together.</description>

Ethna is having her celebrations in Tattersalls near Fairyhouse which is about 2 miles from where I lived until I was 6 years old. Great place. Ethna&#39;s other great news was the recent birth of her son Felix.</description>

      <description>Had our scan today. Wee blobby is right on the predicted size for 9 weeks, 3 days. We expected Sibéal to be rivetted by the ultrasound but in fact she found the roller blind in the doctor&#39;s office to be more interesting. All looks good. Not twins. Sigh of relief. Catherine has the finger rash so is pretty sure what it is going to be. Next scan probably in 8 weeks.</description>

      <description>So I finally moved over to Blogspot so that publishing of this is now trivial and doesn&#39;t require an ftp server somewhere. Hopefully this means I&#39;ll post news more often. Also looking at MSN Spaces but I&#39;ll stick with this for the time being. Tons of bits and pieces which I haven&#39;t reported on over the past few months; new niece Rachel, new house in Old Chapel, Argolon work expanding nicely, waistline not expanding but not shrinking, and no christmas shopping done yet.</description>

Considering the state of the world economy, the business has been doing quite well, but personal financial circumstances mean that I can no longer afford to keep going.

I can&#39;t recommend this trio of tools highly enough. Not only did they catch further BugBear hits, they also tag over 90% of the spam I receive so I can filter to trash. Go get em!  </description>

      <description>I&#39;ve just found out about [IrishWan.org](http://www.irishwan.org/). This is a fantastic idea leveraging 802.11b technology to creat wireless WANs across cities and towns in Ireland. By connecting the Access Points to ADSL, the potential for reducing internet access cost in Ireland by sharing bandwidth and fees is huge. I must dust off the AP I have at home and see about getting myself an omnidirectional antenna. Anyone with wireless equipment and/or ADSL should get involved here.</description>

      <description>Wow, two birth announcements on the same day. Helen and Frank Roberts had baby James at 19:55 on 20th August, a strapping boy of 9lb 15oz. Whilst Betsy and Brian Montayne had a bouncing baby girl, Sarah Elizabeth, at 21:10 on the same day. Massive congrats to both sets of parents and here&#39;s hoping both mothers feel a lot better over the next few days.  </description>

      <description>Appearing on search engines is a tough gig. We&#39;ve been trying to get Advanticus on the various engines for months. It looks like appearing on dmoz is finally the break we have been looking for. So in the next few weeks we should hopefully appear on google.  </description>
