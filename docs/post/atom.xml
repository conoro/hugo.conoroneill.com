&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began this post several months ago. It started quite simply - I wanted to congratulate those behind the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deisegreenway.com/&#34;&gt;Waterford/Deise Greenway&lt;/a&gt; and encourage Cork County Council to embrace a West Cork Greenway and execute on it. The Waterford one is partially opening this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bridge.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Waterford Greenway&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the more I thought about it, the bigger the &amp;ldquo;vision&amp;rdquo; got. What I&amp;rsquo;m going to present here is obvious in many places, controversial in others and possibly pure fantasy. But we simply can&amp;rsquo;t continue to stagger blindly forward, as we have been doing for decades. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a fundamental change in how the infrastructure of this country is arranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teddy Roosevelt, 1903:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not building this country of ours for a day. It is to last through the ages. We stand on the threshold of a new century. We look into the dim years that rise before us, knowing that if we are true that the generations that succeed us here shall fall heir to a heritage such as has never been known before. I ask that we keep in mind not only our own interests, but the interests of our children. Any generation fit to do its work must work for the future, for the people of the future, as well as for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-s-start-small-and-talk-local-first-bandon-and-clonakilty-paths&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start small and talk local first - Bandon and Clonakilty Paths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running or walking in Bandon for health in an exercise in aggravation. I was really pleased when they decided to name a nice short walk by the river after Graham Norton and the old railway walk after Clare O&amp;rsquo;Leary. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like a single person in the County Council thought it would be a good idea to connect the two of them together. So if you want to make use of the nearby railway walk, you either drive there (many do!) or you risk life and limb on a one-foot wide hard shoulder with cars racing by at 100+kph and regularly crashing into each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every road out of Bandon stops just as the houses do and leaves you in mortal danger if you want to go any further on foot. Anyone who cycles from Bandon to Innishannon is very brave indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many Irish towns, Bandon has a love-hate relationship with its river. It&amp;rsquo;s lovely in the few small places you can see it. But it&amp;rsquo;s a beast that has damaged the town too. That relationship was typified by the Bandon Half Marathon and 10K which was run for a few years without a single view of the river. I&amp;rsquo;m convinced a marathon along the river would attract big crowds. Imagine a Bandon to Kinsale run, via Innishannon, on a permanent river trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Bandon is just one local symptom. Look at Clonakilty and Inchydoney. A beach rated as the best in Ireland by Trip Advisor users has a path out towards it that stops at exactly one mile. From then on, grit your teeth and hope some moron doesn&amp;rsquo;t plough you down if you want to walk or run the remaining miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the rest of the country is exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some bright lights - look at the ring road in Kilkenny any evening. It&amp;rsquo;s jammed with people walking and running. Why? Because they can travel everywhere safely on foot. Literally if you build it they will come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Public Bike Scheme in cities also shows what happens when you provide the facilities and infrastructure. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/public-bike-scheme-numbers-show-cycling-is-becoming-more-popular-751422.html?utm_source=iosapp&amp;amp;utm_medium=share&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sharebutton&#34;&gt;Public bike scheme numbers show cycling is becoming more popular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;waterford-greenway&#34;&gt;Waterford Greenway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year I heard about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deisegreenway.com/&#34;&gt;Waterford Greenway&lt;/a&gt; and got very excited. The idea of being able to safely run, walk or cycle from Waterford to Dungarvan along the old railway line struck me as inspirational. I&amp;rsquo;m still shocked it has actually happened. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on it three times now, ahead of its completion and it far exceeds every expectation I had. The views are stunning, the terrain changes all the time and everything about it puts a huge smile on my face. Given how many people I&amp;rsquo;ve met on the Greenway in its unfinished state, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see it when it&amp;rsquo;s finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CszYeE4XgAEnIq6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Waterford Greenway 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing about the Greenway (and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenway.ie/&#34;&gt;Great Western one&lt;/a&gt; and the upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;http://candlgreenway.ie/&#34;&gt;Cavan/Leitrim one&lt;/a&gt;) is that it&amp;rsquo;s a facility for everyone, not just tourists. And that idea became the heart of my thoughts on this wider topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;west-cork-greenway&#34;&gt;West Cork Greenway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cork CoCo has a &amp;ldquo;policy&amp;rdquo; of creating a West Cork Greenway. An &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.corkcoco.ie/co/pdf/562780142.pdf&#34;&gt;excellent study&lt;/a&gt; (warning direct PDF link) was carried out in 2011, which figured out the how, where and cost. But nothing has happened. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to particularly slag off the new not-Alcatraz in the the middle of a freezing cold harbour, as it seems to be off to a good start in peak tourist season. But no one is travelling to Cork to see that. Imagine spending all of that money instead on a perspex enclosed walk across a refurbished Chetwynd Viaduct followed by a renovated Ballinhassig tunnel. It would rightly become world famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;joining-the-dots&#34;&gt;Joining the dots&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now think about an East Cork Greenway. And a New Ross Greenway. And a Rosslare Greenway. And a Dublin to Wexford Greenway. Imagine being able to safely travel on foot or bike from Dublin to Wexford to Waterford to Cork to Barley Cove to Glengarrif to Kenmare to Killarney to Tralee and Dingle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dammit, build a walking trail around the entire coast of Ireland. Something to make the whole world wake up and pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like Northern Ireland has the right idea. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-37355509&#34;&gt;NI greenways: 600-mile network could get Stormont green light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-wild-atlantic-way&#34;&gt;The Wild Atlantic Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been extremely impressed with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wildatlanticway.com/home&#34;&gt;Wild Atlantic Way&lt;/a&gt; marketing campaign. Hell, they make me want to move to Ireland and I live here. But that&amp;rsquo;s all it is, a marketing campaign. The only obvious capital spend outside of marketing is for signage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core problem is that they show all these amazing places you can visit in Ireland and every single one of them requires you to drive there (or risk your neck cycling), since walking or running there would be suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live on a stunning beautiful island. The Wild Atlantic Way should be The Wild Irish way for all of us, not just tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What percentage of the Wild Atlantic Way is car-free vs &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4QeHPn0NWI&#34;&gt;The West Highland Way&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/R8DeYWxmtnc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;national-parks&#34;&gt;National Parks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long section and after Greenways was supposed to be the bulk of this post. But it just made me have even bigger ideas. So bear with me, we&amp;rsquo;ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016 is the Centennial of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nps.gov/subjects/centennial/index.htm&#34;&gt;US National Parks Service&lt;/a&gt; and they are doing a wonderful job promoting that fact. My only experiences of them was a day in Yosemite in 1996 and a day in Grand Canyon in 1998 and both are ingrained on my mind forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by comparing the mission statement of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npws.ie/national-parks&#34;&gt;Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; and the US National Parks Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the policy of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, endorsed by successive governments, to abide by the criteria and standards for National Parks as set by the IUCN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus. Are you as depressed as I was when I read the Irish one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to Google to find out if we even had a National Parks service. I have been in one and to be fair, it&amp;rsquo;s bloody brilliant - Killarney National Park. Check my earlier post on my Marathon there. But I&amp;rsquo;ve also done the Half Marathon down from Moll&amp;rsquo;s Gap. The park is just fantastic. And in keeping with my theme, was full of both tourists and locals when I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been some very positive things happening around the National Parks. The government &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ahrrga.gov.ie/expansion-of-the-wicklow-mountains-national-park/&#34;&gt;bought 5000 acres&lt;/a&gt; in Wicklow that NAMA was trying to hawk to some vulture funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why do we only have six parks? Why not one in every county? Why aren&amp;rsquo;t we buying up land that is of minimal agricultural use and using it in the style of the Americans? Roughly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irunfar.com/2016/08/a-trail-runners-primer-on-public-lands.html&#34;&gt;640 million acres&lt;/a&gt;, or almost a third of the US, fall under the auspices of the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama gets it, why don&amp;rsquo;t we?

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/djDx6LKRFdQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-us-national-parks&#34;&gt;Google also gets it&lt;/a&gt;, why don&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s stop playing with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ahrrga.gov.ie/e4-455-million-approved-by-minister-ring-for-75-rural-recreation-projects/&#34;&gt;mickey-mouse Rural Recreation funding&lt;/a&gt;, welcome tho it is, and do this right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pedestrian-hostile-in-two-generations&#34;&gt;Pedestrian hostile in two generations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hillwalkers and outdoorsey people are a very specific segment. We need to be casting the net much wider and make walking the default for everyone, not the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did we go in two generations from being a piss poor country that couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford cars to one which is actively pedestrian hostile? We went from every kid cycling or walking to school and even university to almost zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did we sleepwalk into this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization estimates that 1.25 million people die from car-related injuries per year. Half of the deaths are pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists hit by cars. Cars are the leading cause of death for people ages 15–29 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget cyclists who are regularly killed. The recent decision in Dublin to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thejournal.ie/cycling-greenways-2964771-Sep2016/&#34;&gt;postpone the bicycle greenways&lt;/a&gt; does not bode well for anything I&amp;rsquo;m proposing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, in Cork &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eveningecho.ie/cork-news/councils-get-gear-cycle-tracks/2524009/&#34;&gt;COUNCILS GET INTO GEAR FOR MORE CYCLE TRACKS&lt;/a&gt;. A blueprint for the development of new cycle lanes and tracks across Cork city and its suburbs has been published jointly by Cork city and county councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;health&#34;&gt;Health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of people trying to do good work around health and fitness here, in the private, public and quango sectors. But it&amp;rsquo;s mostly siloed, piecemeal or, in the case of something like National Fitness Day, tokenistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of looking like you are doing something but really just ticking boxes is &lt;a href=&#34;http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/ministers-launch-a-healthy-weight-for-ireland-obesity-policy-and-action-plan-2016-2025/&#34;&gt;A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025&lt;/a&gt;. Even the most naive of us go into full eyeroll mode when we see press releases that prattle on about guidelines, forums and stakeholders. The only surprise is that they didn&amp;rsquo;t announce another taskforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a great example of actually doing something practical is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parkrun.com/&#34;&gt;Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; movement. A recent tweet by the organisation in the UK said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whopping 92,432 people crossed a parkrun finish line in the UK this weekend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that 92k is not whopping in a country of 64 million people where 62% of people are overweight or obese. A more fundamental change is needed rather than events which will never be more than niche for people who already want to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whilst it&amp;rsquo;s great to see Coillte adding things like Zipit in Farran wood, it costs money to use those things. It also costs money to park there. And you&amp;rsquo;d be suicidal to try and get there on foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health shouldn&amp;rsquo;t require wealth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a new problem. In 1963 JFK was horrified by the stats he saw about the declining fitness of young people. He kicked off a range of initiatives including a set of 50 mile events which were hugely popular that year. RFK even completed a 50 miler. But then JFK was assassinated. Very quickly the events petered out and now there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jfk50mile.org/history/&#34;&gt;only one 50 miler left&lt;/a&gt;. Which someday I hope to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we get the people who need to move the most moving, but who are least likely to do so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What percentage of our multi-billion-Euro health budget is spent dealing with preventable no-exercise related diseases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like Autonomous cars are only going to make things worse. Do we really want to end up like L.A. Story?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/3gP_ErrRILk&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great piece in the Irish Times on this. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/ian-o-riordan-we-are-sports-mad-but-sanity-needed-to-tackle-obesity-1.2794132#.V9xTtrZY9qI.twitter&#34;&gt;Ian O’Riordan: We are sports mad but sanity needed to tackle obesity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed there is something strangely contradictory about all this talk of overweight adults and children and the rise of obesity, which according to some reports, will be hovering somewhere around 90 per cent of the population by 2030, the highest projected level Europe. You don’t need me to repeat the scary thought that one in four Irish children is now considered to be overweight, because for a country that prides itself on being so mad about sport, that makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sidenote-dogs-and-dog-shit&#34;&gt;Sidenote - Dogs and dog shit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting to the point where I think dogs need to be temporarily banned from all public footpaths until a large proportion of their idiot owners stop behaving like 12th century peasants throwing their shit out onto the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick up your dogs&amp;rsquo; shit and put your dog on a goddammed leash, you morons. I&amp;rsquo;ve had two little unleashed runt-sized dogs snapping at my heels recently when out on runs. The next one gets a kick in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waterford is thinking of banning dogs from the Greenway. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s already riddled with dog shit before it&amp;rsquo;s open, they are 100% right. On one of my runs there, a woman had a large dog on a harness and struggled to control it as it tried to jump at me and attack me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s actually a revenue opportunity here. Dog-walking arenas. Places that dog-owners can go to walk their dogs, step in each others shit and break up the dog-fights. Lots of farmers could create these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping that responsible reasonable dog owners shame the idiots into behaving properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;france&#34;&gt;France&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France has lots of problems but seems to have some vision for walkers. We went to a holiday/caravan park in Marennes this year, south of La Rochelle, for the second time. Many people who go to these kind of places never leave the camp except maybe to drive to the supermarket. I know we&amp;rsquo;ve been guilty of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I decided to be different and went for two runs in the locality. I was, to be honest, a bit worried beforehand, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the roads at all. Some Google Streetview calmed me. On my first run, I did a short 4km loop around some back roads. And it was an absolute joy. Why? No damned hedges and a grass verge that was flush with the road. Plenty of the usual little white French vans passed me but [a] I could see them coming for ages and [b] I could take a small step sideways to be 100% safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/verge.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;France Verge&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my second run, I went much further afield and was thrilled to discover an offical nature trail. This was created just with basic crushed white rock and was a lovely surface to run on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160723_083535.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;France 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return leg was on a very busy road. But again, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem. No hedges, and big flat verge. We&amp;rsquo;ll get back to hedges in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not just summer holiday locations where the French are looking at this. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/05/in-paris-plans-for-a-river-seine-reinvention/392639/&#34;&gt;In Paris, Plans for a Seine Reinvention&lt;/a&gt;. Mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced an &amp;ldquo;almost philosophical project&amp;rdquo; to take the famed river&amp;rsquo;s quayside back from cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Dublin&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thejournal.ie/cycling-greenways-2964771-Sep2016/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s bananas!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; Fury as funding pulled for Dublin cycling projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-forestation-wildlands-wetlands&#34;&gt;Re-forestation, Wildlands, Wetlands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bit is critical for the next bit. We need a massive re-forestion of the country and the annexing of large areas for wildlife and plants. Every idle bit of land and farmland should be planted with native species (not poxy pines obviously). This is not for commercial purposes, tho that needn&amp;rsquo;t be excluded in all cases. It ties into the National Park idea but more importantly, it gives wildlife and birds somewhere permanent away from the regular cutting of hedgerows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And before you tell me that it will take decades, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gearjunkie.com/india-plants-50-million-trees-one-day&#34;&gt;India Plants 50 million trees in one day&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/national-forest-woodland-midlands-regeneration&#34;&gt;How millions of trees brought a broken landscape back to life&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;rsquo;s that vision thing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hedgerows&#34;&gt;Hedgerows&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now for the controversial bit that I&amp;rsquo;m sure you saw coming. It&amp;rsquo;s time to get rid of all our our roadside hedgerows and ditches. All of them. Wait, wait, before you blow a gasket and start calling me names. First, we need that massive re-forestation programme to ensure that birds and wildlife have somewhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main impediment to people being able to walk safely everywhere is [a] visibility and [b] having somewhere to put their feet. The removal of all hedges and the covering over of all ditches deals with this. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a lot of ditch covering locally on small roads recently, but of course it&amp;rsquo;s not being done in a way that anyone could actually walk on. So this is eminently possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do one of the loops of the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.com/2016/08/26/the-seven-heads-walk-and-lusitania-trail-is-one-of-west-corks-best-kept-secrets/&#34;&gt;Lusitania Trail&lt;/a&gt;, this is the road you have to walk back on, with cars whizzing by at 100kph. It&amp;rsquo;s not something I would ever do by choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/irish_roads.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Irish Roads&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government should CPO every roadside ditch and hedge. This removes the current nonsense where hedge cuttting is the landowners responsibility and can only happen during certain months due to nests. Get rid of the lot and the birds can go back to their natural pre-road habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 1: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/county-heritage-services/news/view-article/article/new-initiatives-launched-to-safeguard-irelands-unique-hedgerows/&#34;&gt;A good link&lt;/a&gt; from my sister around a new initiative to safeguard hedgerows in Ireland. Just to be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about creating far more hedgerows and wilderness areas than we have now, just not beside roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-ireland&#34;&gt;A New Ireland&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a very long run up to the idea that a whole new outlook is needed in Ireland. We need a grand revolutionary vision and plan for the health of our people and then the execution of that plan quickly. It can&amp;rsquo;t be years of consultants reports and local government jollies and civil servant conservatism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the current generation of politicians and public servants in this country want to be forgotten in a few short years due to being bench-warmers who think keeping a steady hand on the tiller is their only job? Or do they want to be like Teddy Roosevelt, JFK, Donagh O&amp;rsquo;Malley and T. K. Whitaker, still being talked about decades later?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we can&amp;rsquo;t do a &amp;ldquo;big bang deployment&amp;rdquo;, as we say in software. It has to be iterative but based on a core set of principles. We could start tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every child should be able to walk and cycle safely to school. Build pathways to every school in the country spreading out like a spider&amp;rsquo;s web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move all religious education to after-school opt-in per religion. Replace all of that school time with outdoor activities, no matter what the weather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone should be able to walk and cycle safely from every town to every town in this country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give pedestrians the Right of Way by default everywhere. Cars must stop if you want to cross the road. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/02/economist-explains-16&#34;&gt;Why Sweden has so few road deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone from the Dept of Env, County/City Councils, HSE, NRA, OPW, Coillte and every relevant department and quango are told exactly how they are going to be part of the solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In advance of a massive buy-up of land for the National Parks, do a huge expansion of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.housing.gov.ie/community/rural-development/walks-scheme/walks-scheme&#34;&gt;Walks Scheme&lt;/a&gt; to make trails available everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start major re-forestation immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start removing all hedgerows on major roads initially&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes this will eventually be a grand building program and require large capital investment. For the pathways, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be expensive pavement or tarmac or cobble lock everywhere. Crushed hard core is sufficient. But it also can&amp;rsquo;t be a poxy white line painted on a road with a few &amp;ldquo;caution pedestrians&amp;rdquo; signs. The criminal negligence of Irish drivers at pelican crossings makes that unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paying-for-it&#34;&gt;Paying for it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how to pay for all of this? Let&amp;rsquo;s start with no new road building. Divert all of those funds to the building of pathways and trails. Look, I hate the roads to Killarney and Limerick as much as you do. And as for Dunkettle! But I&amp;rsquo;m talking about something a lot more important than a few extra minutes driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The removal of the hedgerows will deal with a large number of traffic accidents that happen here when idiots overtake blind on country roads. That&amp;rsquo;s a positive feedback loop that will help pay for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top causes of death in Ireland are all lifestyle diseases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coronary heart disease 8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heart attack 8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung cancer 6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COPD 5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pull several hundred million out of the health budget that is currently being spent on dealing with preventable lifestyle-related illnesses. Provide cheap runners and step trackers to everyone who is capable of curing themselves, instead of rip-off statins and other heart meds. Carrot and Stick. Or carrot and vape for the smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are also revenue oportunities. Figures from Fáilte Ireland show that in 2014, close to 1.2 million visitors to Ireland took part in hiking or cross country walking. These activity tourists spent in the region of €915 million in the Irish economy during their stay. Other stats show that 286,000 visitors took part in cycling activities with a spend of €268 million. These two sectors combined generated revenue for the Irish economy in the region of €1.2 billion in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is in a country that&amp;rsquo;s actively hostile to both walkers and cyclists!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine how much revenue we could generate if we made their lives easy? All related taxes should be used to pay for the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-but-but-this-is-how-things-have-always-been&#34;&gt;But, but, but, this is how things have always been&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..in your lifetime. A pre-famine landscape looked nothing like it does now. A pre-deforestation landscape looked nothing like it does now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time big changes are suggested I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of Douglas Adams on technology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that&amp;rsquo;s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything invented after you&amp;rsquo;re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plan like this addresses health, jobs, tourism, taxes and the environment. Ireland could be leading the way in Europe. Just like we did with fags and bags but with 100x the long term benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health crisis in Ireland reminds me a bit of global warming. It happens so gradually that the average person doesn&amp;rsquo;t realise the frog is being boiled. Unlike global warming, it&amp;rsquo;s not too late to deal with this health problem. But it&amp;rsquo;s going to take an incredibly strong will to do so. Sadly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think we have anyone in a position of power in this country capable of making it happen. So the best I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do is make sure my kids are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughts&#34;&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop them in the comments box below. Always interested in views no matter how much they oppose my own. No safe spaces here. The only rule is that we keep it civil.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tough as Leather - The Story of Sporting Legend John Lenihan</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/19/tough-as-leather-john-lenihan/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2016 18:53:32 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/19/tough-as-leather-john-lenihan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally a book review on the blog. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I heard about this book, probably Twitter, but damn it&amp;rsquo;s a great story. I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of John Lenihan until 3 weeks ago. Then I read this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/tough-as-leather-john-lenihan-the-conqueror-of-carrauntoohil-1.2273089&#34;&gt;Irish Times article&lt;/a&gt; and my jaw was on the floor. He has not only won the Carrauntoohil mountain race 19 times, he still holds the record of 1 hour 11 minutes and 43 seconds. Read that again. Up and down the highest mountain in Ireland in 1:11:43. Holy shit the man is a running machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/CsLX2RxWAAUssQO.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tough as Leather&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His story is genuinely interesting and he comes across as a honourable talented hard-working man who will probably never get the adulation he deserves. The writing itself is very pedestrian but that&amp;rsquo;s ok, the story is strong enough to carry it. A recommended read if you have any interest in running, striving or making hard choices. You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bookdepository.com/Tough-Leather-John-Lenihan/9781782805045&#34;&gt;buy it on Book Depository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Altra Lone Peak 3.0 first impressions</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/19/altra-lone-peak-30-first-impressions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2016 18:43:32 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/19/altra-lone-peak-30-first-impressions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve done my first trail race, it&amp;rsquo;s time for my initial impressions of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.altrarunning.com/men/lone-peak-30&#34;&gt;Altra Lone Peak 3.0&lt;/a&gt;. Back in June I got a pair of LP 2.5 in &lt;a href=&#34;https://sports-basement.myshopify.com/pages/store-sf-bryant-street/&#34;&gt;Sports Basement&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. They were supposed to be my first pair of trail runners but I found them so comfy they immediately became my daily shoes. When I went to get another pair in Europe I learned that they were about to be replaced with the 3.0. If you can find any pairs of 2.5, grab them, they are a complete bargain now and very different to the 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best place I found to get the 3.0 on this side of the pond was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.accelerateuk.com/shop/product/21/Mountain--Trail-and-Fell/Altra-ZeroDrop-Lone-Peak-3-0/&#34;&gt;Accelerate UK&lt;/a&gt;. They sent me one of the first pairs they got last week. They look completely different to the 2.5 and TBH are a bit generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/A1653_Orange_btn4_xl.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;LP30 Clean&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main changes, apart from looks are a smaller &amp;ldquo;last&amp;rdquo; and a grippier sole. Whilst the 2.5 are a bit loose on me, the 3.0 is snug and a perfect fit with the usual Altra benefits of wide toe-box, high stack and zero drop. I was concerned when I did a short first run on them on the treadmill that my left arch hurt a lot. The insole at the arch seems to be very high on these. Much higher than any other Altras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real test came yesterday during Run Forest Run and they were fantastic. The fit on my foot remained great, the arch pain was gone and the grip was incredible on all of the surfaces. Just a warning that whilst they are trail shoes, they are not waterproof as I quickly discovered. Irish puddles, yay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/lone_peak_30.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;LP30&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know lots of other people have the same criticism of Altra that I do. I love their products but this sizing nonsense has to stop. It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that two of your products fit completely differently for the same nominal size, but when you are doing it between versions of the same product, it&amp;rsquo;s just ridiculous! From what I can see, every review of the 3.0 on the Altra site is complaining about the sizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in summary - I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the LP 3.0. But go 1 Euro size up from your usual running shoes. Unfortunately no one in Ireland seems to sell them so, if they don&amp;rsquo;t fit, you may be in the usual world of product returns cost hell that we suffer from over here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Run Forest Run trail race report. Loved it!</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/19/run-forest-run-trail-race-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2016 18:33:32 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2016/09/19/run-forest-run-trail-race-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may have read in my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dipping my toe into running off-road. The phrase &amp;ldquo;trail running&amp;rdquo; still seems pretty rare in Ireland where I see &amp;ldquo;mountain running&amp;rdquo; mentioned more often, and &amp;ldquo;fell running&amp;rdquo; in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week my wife spotted on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://corkrunning.blogspot.ie/&#34;&gt;Running in Cork blog&lt;/a&gt; that there was a trail run on in Castlefreke/Rathbarry on Sunday 18th called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/Run-Forest-Run-175750705775650/?fref=ts&#34;&gt;Run Forest Run&lt;/a&gt;. It instantly got me interested as it was [a] nearby and [b] only 5 miles long. I have just spent 11 days sick on and off after a trip to Vietnam. Top tip - don&amp;rsquo;t brush your teeth with the tap-water, even in a high-end hotel. I&amp;rsquo;m doing the Berlin Marathon next Sunday, so the big question I wanted to answer yesterday was &amp;ldquo;am I well enough for Berlin yet?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the laugh I asked my 14yo and the 17yo sons if they wanted to do it with me. I was shocked when they both said yes. Their mother then added the sweetener of €20 for the winner between the three of us. Neither of them have done much more than a bit of running in school, so I was very impressed by their enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the Strava route and Ordnance Survey map below. A lovely mix of path, trail, road, forest and beach in a beautiful part of West Cork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/run_forest_run_route.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Route1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/14224702_1430913196926055_7696748586087695054_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Route2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Sunday morning welcomed us with lashing rain. But what the hell, in for a penny, in for €20. The start/finish was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.galleyflash.com/&#34;&gt;Galleyflash Rowing Club&lt;/a&gt; on Kilkern lake. A few people were there when we arrived and sadly the numbers didn&amp;rsquo;t really grow. In the end, they dropped the 5km and only 19 of us lined out for the 5 miler. I figure there were three reasons for turnout: [1] the rotten weather [2] the Charleville Half Marathon with nearly 1000 people was on the same day and [3] the lack of much publicity for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_113913.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lake&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we didn&amp;rsquo;t mind in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_115939.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Start&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off we went and we quickly ended up at the back of the field. But the two boys looked solid and we were doing a decent pace for n00bs. They slowed down a bit going into Castlefreke Woods and then grinded to a slow walk going up the first hill in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_121814.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Woods&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We picked the pace back-up and did the road stretch quickly. Then on to the nasty-assed hill up to the large cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_124653.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hill&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boys were struggling with tiredness and calf pain and they claimed to have found god at this point ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/runforestrun/20160918_124928.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cross&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downhill was brilliant fun and we ran the whole thing. Here&amp;rsquo;s a video which gives some sense of the fantastic location and views. Apologies for the relentless heavy breathing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/_NhKnpDfQXI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The final mile on the beach was brilliantly horrific with huge patches of soft sand you couldn&amp;rsquo;t avoid. Then back on to the road for a bit and to the Rowing club. The 14yo came in first of us, having found a great second wind. The 17yo hurt his achilles on the beach and came in last. But I was incredibly proud of them both. 8.4km is no joke off-road in the lashing rain when you have done no training for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tea and biccies sorted us out before we drove home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to thank the organisers and helpers for a superb event. Everything was absolutely top notch from the signage to the stewards. I&amp;rsquo;d particularly call out the young guy at the end of the beach who had to stand there watching 3 slowly moving bodies in the rain for an interminable duration so he could tell us where to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be making lots of noise about this event next year to try and drive up the numbers. Honestly, even if you&amp;rsquo;ve never run before, you&amp;rsquo;ll love this route and the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imra.ie/events/details/id/1339/&#34;&gt;IMRA also did an event here&lt;/a&gt; in February. I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to do that if it&amp;rsquo;s on next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know of any other trail events like this in West Cork, do let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and yes, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine for Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1: There is now a &lt;a href=&#34;http://corkrunning.blogspot.ie/2016/09/results-photos-of-run-forest-run-5m-in.html&#34;&gt;Running in Cork post&lt;/a&gt; about it and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/Run-Forest-Run-175750705775650/photos/?tab=album&amp;amp;album_id=1445859345431440&#34;&gt;gallery of pics on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Seven Heads Walk, Fuschia Walk and Lusitania Trail is one of West Cork&#39;s best kept secrets. Just go.</title>

      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2016/08/26/the-seven-heads-walk-and-lusitania-trail-is-one-of-west-corks-best-kept-secrets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shortly after we moved to Bandon, over 10 years ago, I bought a bunch of Ordnance Survey maps of the area and two books by Damien Enright called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Walks-Courtmacsherry-Seven-Damien-Enright/dp/1902631005&#34;&gt;Walks of Courtmacsherry Bay &amp;amp; The Seven Heads&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Walks in and around Kinsale&amp;rdquo;. We had high hopes of being outdoorsy. To our shame, the most we ever did was to haul the kids along the short track in Kilbrittain woods, the even shorter one in Ballinspittle woods and the tiny bit longer one in Dromillihy woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of places to safely walk in West Cork outside of towns is ridiculous. I have a separate monster blogpost coming that includes this topic. It&amp;rsquo;s a cracker. But this one is about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sevenheadspeninsula.ie/&#34;&gt;The Seven Heads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/3QOn-AdXV_s&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently become very interested in the whole idea of trail running. By interested I mean I watch huge numbers of YouTube videos about it and revel in the incredible achievements of people who do races like &lt;a href=&#34;http://barkleymovie.com/&#34;&gt;The Barkley Marathons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/&#34;&gt;UTMB (Ultra Trail de Mont Blanc)&lt;/a&gt; which started two hours ago. But a few weeks ago I finally decided I wanted to make some sort of attempt at doing it myself. Of course I had to do a pre-run, so I hauled the smaller kids out to Courtmac and the start of what now seems to be more formally called The Lusitania Trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I did when dragged on walks by my parents, they hated every step. I loved every minute. The route was basically the first recommended short loop. You can read all the details over on the superb pages on &lt;a href=&#34;http://explorewestcork.ie/walking/seven-heads-walk/&#34;&gt;Explore West Cork&lt;/a&gt;. In fact I printed out their directions and made a copy of that section of Map 87. In reality you need none of that, since the whole thing is now signposted as The Lusitania Trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the ever-changing views that make this such a spectacular walk. You begin in Courtmac, then into woods with beautiful little slipways down to the water, then suddenly the first gobsmacking headland and the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty easy walk apart from places where the cows have mushed the ground up badly. Lots of stiles separate the fields and it&amp;rsquo;s completely safe. The Fuschia Walk is absolutely beautiful and you come back through the lovely Ramsey Hill cottages and then on footpath all the way to Courtmac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2010.54.36.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Leaving Woods&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2010.54.50.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;First Look&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so delighted with our trip that I vowed to come back. A few weeks passed and I repeated the route but started in Timoleague and ran most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2010.04.42.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Timoleague&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was tough on the ankles in places but the weather was fantastic so I didn&amp;rsquo;t need trail runners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2010.54.54.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ankles&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later I was back again. This time it was a 15 mile loop that again started in Timoleague. I found that the written directions on Explore West Cork were very hard to follow and I did a lot of recce via Google Maps and the Ordnance Survey map in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2011.06.28.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Woods&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2011.06.54.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Woods2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, yet again, the entire route was signposted and took almost no thinking on my part. The only place I got confused was on Broadstrand where you have to go the entire length of the beach before you see the steps back up to the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2011.27.55.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Meelmane&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2011.31.20.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Broadstrand&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2011.43.00.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Statue&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one very steep path up along some fields and then an old pre-Famine road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07 11.52.16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Start famine Road&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which eventually brings you out to this amazing view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2012.09.01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Headlands&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to Narry&amp;rsquo;s Cross and then I returned along some very quiet roads via Lislee and a busy main road back into Courtmacsherry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2012.42.17.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lislee&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2012.52.43.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Main Road&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to take a breather there and have an ice-cream and Lucozade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07%2013.13.27.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ice Cream&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the final push back to the car in Timoleague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully intend to go again soon and run the entire route which is heading towards Ultra Marathon length. Well, when I say run, I mean run-walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I wanted to write this post is that the Seven Heads walk is little more than a name for many people. It&amp;rsquo;s barely a 20 minute drive from Bandon. Probably less from Clonakilty. Much of it is completely off-road with no asshole drivers. If you are looking for some of the best views in the country and a bit of exercise, you owe it to yourself to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for my next post which takes this basic topic and turns it into a very long rant about the future of the country&amp;rsquo;s health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A year of running updates</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2016/07/10/a-year-of-running-updates/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2016 18:32:32 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2016/07/10/a-year-of-running-updates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As has been the case so often over the past 15 years of blogging, I&amp;rsquo;ve been very remiss in my updates. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a ton of things I want to write about, like the Waterford Greenway and how adventure/outdoor tourism could be a much bigger business here. But that&amp;rsquo;s for my holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, as I move this blog to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/]&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; (what a journey it has had!), I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just give an update on my running. The last time I mentioned it, I had &lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.com/2015/05/03/this-heavy-guy-decided-to-run-the-london-marathon-and-you-won-t-believe-what-happened-next/&#34;&gt;just finished the London Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. Still a life highlight for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of 2015 was quiet from a &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; perspective. I signed up for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dinglemarathon.ie/&#34;&gt;Dingle Marathon&lt;/a&gt; and then chickened out and did the Half. Very glad I did, as I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten what a tough course it is. But it is still one of the greatest routes anywhere on the planet. Even the Top Gear guys agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://runclon.ie/&#34;&gt;Clon Half&lt;/a&gt; was delayed due to the flooding, so basically I spent most of 2015 doing short runs around the town and on the treadmill and making no impact on my weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So January 1st lands and we decide to really push it. We signed up for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greatermanchestermarathon.com/&#34;&gt;Greater Manchester Marathon&lt;/a&gt; in April and kicked off training. Things went well and I particularly enjoyed my 18 mile loop from the train station in Cork out to Ballincollig and back. It beats running 3 times around Bandon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Clon Half was re-scheduled for February and that was as tough as ever, with the added feature of horizontal driving rain. A terribly slow time but it was fine overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on to Manchester with 3 of us heading over. The race itself was very flat but also suburban boring. I found it tough mentally but physically I was fine and I did a sprint finish. The non-alcoholic Erdinger at the finish line was a lovely touch. The multi-hour disaster of bag pickup didn&amp;rsquo;t affect me but left a sour taste in everyone&amp;rsquo;s mouths. The fact that I could walk up stairs that evening told me I really hadn&amp;rsquo;t pushed it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done the Cork Half a few years ago, it seemed ridiculous that we hadn&amp;rsquo;t done the full &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/&#34;&gt;Cork Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. So we then signed up to run that in June. A few weeks into training and again it was time for the long run. And again the thought of 3 times around Bandon filled us with dread. So, what the hell, we decided to do the &lt;a href=&#34;http://killarneymarathonofthelakes.com/&#34;&gt;Lakes Of Killarney Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a small event with 3 loops of the National Park. The views were incredible. The day was boiling hot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel great. The first loop was OK but up/down hard. Mentally I was in a baddddd place. Half way round the second loop I decided I was going to quit. So I kept going to the checkpoint, crossed the timing mat and started heading towards the barriers to leave. And then, the tannoy boomed &amp;ldquo;And here&amp;rsquo;s Conor O&amp;rsquo;Neill, about to start his third loop.&amp;rdquo;. Nooooooooooo. The only force more effective than exhaustion is shame and embarrassment for an Irish person. So I kept going for another 9 miles. Pure bloody torture. I finished 3rd last. And as always, the moment I crossed the finish line I thought &amp;ldquo;ah that was fine really&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we get to Cork. The third marathon in 8 weeks. What the hell are we at? I thought I&amp;rsquo;d only ever do one marathon! But I was feeling good. The cumulative effect of the training seemed to be helping. No injuries. 1.5 stone lighter than Jan 1st. But still crazily overweight. The race kicked off on Patrick Street. Within a few minutes, my friend Walter appeared and we had a good natter out towards Blackpool and then on towards the tunnel. But, despite his injury, there is no way he could run as slowly as me, so he headed off into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with audio for runs. On short ones, I use nothing. For long ones, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using podcasts for many years. Often running podcasts too, to be very meta. But I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that [a] I run slower when they are playing and [b] I find it hard to concentrate and overcome pain/tiredness/etc when they are playing. So for Cork I listened to a random &amp;ldquo;dance workout mix&amp;rdquo;. And it bloody worked. Despite physically finding Cork gruelling, I was in a great place mentally for the entire thing. But the hills, jesus how did I forget the relentless goddammed hills? As expected, Model Farm was the absolute nadir. My feet barely moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidebar: I&amp;rsquo;ve been on various running forums and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/running/&#34;&gt;/r/running&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit recently and I listen to quite a few running/ultra podcasts. And I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a tendency for some people there to belittle very slow runners or runner/walkers. My guess is that these are mostly people in their 20s/early-30s at peak fitness who have yet to learn the real meaning of the word empathy. As their bodies age, they may start to understand. During the Cork Marathon, I passed a woman going even slower than me up Model Farm Road. As I approached, I realised from her back-bib that she was running the Half. Yes, this woman was on hour five of a Half Marathon. That&amp;rsquo;s gumption. That&amp;rsquo;s depth of character. That&amp;rsquo;s someone to look up to, rather than snarking about their age/weight/training. So the next time you see someone shuffling slowly along in their runners, do what someone did to me today as I jogged towards the &lt;a href=&#34;http://explorewestcork.ie/walking/seven-heads-walk/&#34;&gt;Fuschia Trail on Seven Heads&lt;/a&gt;. Shout &amp;ldquo;Fair play to you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished Cork completely drained. That&amp;rsquo;s the shakiest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been at the end of my six Marathons. I think it was the heat and possibly screwing up hydration. It took me over a week to feel in any way right. 10 days before I even got on the treadmill. 3 marathons in 8 weeks was maybe a bit much for someone this heavy. But I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three small runs were all in the past two weeks. I was in San Francisco at Red Hat Summit and did a 7 mile loop from Crissy Fields over the Golden Gate and back. Loved every minute of it and had perfect weather to take amazing photos. Then we had the Red Hat 5K Fun Run from Moscone to Embarcadero and back. I think that gave me a 5K PB, despite all the traffic lights! And then finally today I ran from Timoleague to Courtmacsherry and round the first short loop of the Seven Heads and back to Timoleague. I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend this route highly enough. You don&amp;rsquo;t need trail runners for the Seven Heads piece but it is hard on the ankles. The plan is to try some of the longer loops soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next up? Well we&amp;rsquo;re booked for Berlin and that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a PB for me if it kills me. I think we have to do Dublin too, given the year that&amp;rsquo;s in it. But to break up the training boredom we&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a Full and a Half in August. All recommendations welcome. Not too far from Cork tho. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably just do the Half in Clon in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the planning has begun for an Ultra. Hopefully 2017. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be 50lbs lighter. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably start with a 50K to dip the toe in and then I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be leading the pack at &lt;a href=&#34;http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/&#34;&gt;UTMB&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people in this country seem happy enough to have it run by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1102/308186-finance/&#34;&gt;imbeciles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.moriarty-tribunal.ie/&#34;&gt;criminals&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s a relief that some people actually care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/&#34;&gt;official web-site&lt;/a&gt; which holds the records of the Oireachtas is the kind of incompetent mess that can only have been designed to be that way on purpose. Luckily John Handelaar built &lt;a href=&#34;http://KildareStreet.com&#34;&gt;KildareStreet.com&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago to shine a light on the goings-on in the Dáil and Seanad. Not only does it contain all of the records but it lets you request things like “email me when the clown I voted for actually speaks in the Dáil”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.kildarestreet.com/images/kildarestreetcom.gif&#34; alt=&#34;KildareStreet&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Humphrey and his minions made a concerted effort to kill KildareStreet a while back by changing all of their data formats, but they underestimated Mr Handelaar and it is still going strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not think this is an important resource until the day it’s gone. We live in a country where the insiders rely on a compliant uninformed populus and a complicit media. It’s scary how critical KildareStreet.com is to our inept democracy. A tiny glimmer of hope in this third-world banana republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But John and Sabrina can’t afford to run this out of &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@sabrinadent/an-open-letter-to-stephanie-lord-who-is-gutted-about-kildarestreet-com-22a37aaaf148&#34;&gt;the goodness of their hearts&lt;/a&gt;. So go now to &lt;a href=&#34;https://donorbox.org/kildarestreet&#34;&gt;donorbox.org&lt;/a&gt; and vote with your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;ve finally found a running audio setup that works</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2015/10/04/i-ve-finally-found-a-running-audio-setup-that-works/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2015 14:02:05 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2015/10/04/i-ve-finally-found-a-running-audio-setup-that-works/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running slowly since 2009. This year has seen two and a half marathons so far, with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://runclon.ie/&#34;&gt;Clon Half&lt;/a&gt; probably ending the year nicely. But since the very first run I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with audio. I think most people listen to music and I&amp;rsquo;ve done that a bit but I&amp;rsquo;ve spent far more time listening to Podcasts. I listened to Kermode and Mayo on my first Half Marathon in Dingle in 2010 and I listened to them again a few weeks ago in Dingle in the 2015 Half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is when you&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a podcast and either you find it boring or it annoys you so much you have to turn it off. Some of the more &amp;ldquo;worthy&amp;rdquo; American ones are very hit and miss. As my phone is normally strapped to my arm with a headphone lead snaking down my sleeve, the only thing I can really do is leave the podcast running and pull out the earbuds from my ears. Actually I normally only run with one earbud in for safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried over-ear Bluetooth headphones as a solution but, as a glasses wearer, they give me a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also tried expensive in-ear ones with inline audio controls. But Samsung, in its brilliance, doesn&amp;rsquo;t support them on the S6, apart from play/pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidebar: Google and Apple, get into a room, agree a standard one-wire low power digital protocol for audio and bloody implement it. For the love of god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I&amp;rsquo;d tried some cheap Chinese Bluetooth adapters too but they were useless and fiddly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then two weeks ago, I discovered that Sony released a pair of ear buds with a Bluetooth audio adapter ages ago, and the reviews were all positive. The official name is Sony SBH20 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headset with NFC and Multi-Point Connectivity. Even better, because it&amp;rsquo;s getting-on a bit, the price is now really low. I got mine on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.7dayshop.com/products/sony-sbh20-stereo-bluetooth-wireless-headset-with-nfc-and-multi-point-connectivity-black-WH2-SBH20BK&#34;&gt;7dayshop.com&lt;/a&gt; for £15 delivered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sbh20bk-01_1_small.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sony SBH20&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assumed I&amp;rsquo;d switch the Sony earbuds for something better but they have proven to be perfect for podcasts. They also have very short leads, so you can clip the adapter to the neck of your running top, stick one bud in one ear, loop around your neck and stick the other bud in the other ear. Nothing is left to flap around. It gives you play/pause, prev/next and vol up/down. Works perfectly in BeyondPod on Android. I assume it&amp;rsquo;d be the same on iPhone. After two runs with them, I&amp;rsquo;m completely sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next job is to get the podcasts and music visible in one app and build a mixed playlist for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://runclon.ie/half-marathon/&#34;&gt;Clon Half&lt;/a&gt;. Something like Rocky definitely needed for that last hill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2015/05/03/this-heavy-guy-decided-to-run-the-london-marathon-and-you-won-t-believe-what-happened-next/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I figured it was either that title or &amp;ldquo;5 ways you can run the London Marathon without even trying&amp;rdquo; ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d told me in 2008 that I&amp;rsquo;d ever run a 10k, I&amp;rsquo;d have laughed at you. If you&amp;rsquo;d told me in 2009 that I&amp;rsquo;d ever run a half marathon, I&amp;rsquo;d have laughed at you. If you&amp;rsquo;d told me in 2011 that I&amp;rsquo;d ever run a marathon, I&amp;rsquo;d have laughed at you. If you&amp;rsquo;d told me in 2014 that I&amp;rsquo;d ever run two marathons in 5 weeks, I&amp;rsquo;d have laughed at you. You get my point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.com/2013/01/02/three-full-years-a-running-and-my-first-marathon/&#34;&gt;blogged two years ago&lt;/a&gt; about the Dublin Marathon and I thought that was the last time I&amp;rsquo;d ever mention a marathon. I&amp;rsquo;ve done several half marathons and 10k runs since but at the back of my mind I wondered if I&amp;rsquo;d ever give 26.2 miles another go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an abortive attempt at training for Dublin 2014 but then in December my wife suggested we do London. Initially I thought no. If I was ever to do it, I&amp;rsquo;d want to lose 5 stone and be ultra fit so I&amp;rsquo;d do it in a time to be proud of. But I thought about it more and realised I could be dead long before then. As a Carpe Diem kind of person it just made sense to do it. So our Christmas present to each other was entry to the 2015 London Marathon (via the absolutely superb &lt;a href=&#34;http://sportstravelinternational.com/&#34;&gt;Sports Travel International&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training went well as I lost 1.5 stone, upped my speeds and experimented with various minimal-drop non-Five-Fingers running shoes. Then we realised in early March that some travel and Easter would mess up the training schedule. I was following the London Intermediate schedule which meant that 22 miles was the peak training distance but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be around to do that weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we decided to throw caution to the wind and do the Tralee Marathon for &amp;ldquo;practice&amp;rdquo;. One reason I was a big fan of this idea was that I could make all the mistakes and deal with all the worry in Tralee. It was a very small race of fewer than 400 people and I came 8th last in a time of 5:45. Most of the slowness was caused by my walking up the hills of the second half. But I was happy because it was very doable, I didn&amp;rsquo;t destroy my body and I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose my mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now London felt totally manageable and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t stressed at all. I upped my speed some more in the final weeks to see if I could crack 5 hours in London. I gave up on using the New Balance MR00 and I could not get comfortable in a new pair of MR10 so my old knackered worn-heel pair of MR10 were chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the day came. A 6am wake-up and we arrived at the start area by coach with over two hours to wait. The crowds of runners just built and built. The announcer said that 38000 people were due to start. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even imagine how many people that is! The adrenalin began to flow and the wind, drizzle and cool temperature did nothing to reduce my enthusiasm. Hot tea and coffee was an unusual but much appreciated aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 10am I shed my Christmas jumper and lined up the podcasts on my phone. Catherine headed to the faster zone and I went to the rear. At 10:10 I started RunKeeper and the shuffle to the start line began. As soon as we crossed the line, I began running and had none of the predicted start-stop that London is infamous for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/conor_marathon_start.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Marathon Start Line&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next 5 hours and 40 minutes were like nothing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced in my life. I&amp;rsquo;m going to struggle to describe just how it felt. If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard that the crowds in London are great then you still haven&amp;rsquo;t the vaguest idea of what the people of London do for the Marathon. It&amp;rsquo;s on an epic scale. Imagine 26.2 miles of people all lined up on both sides of the roads winding through London all cheering shouting, banging, singing, playing and dancing. And all of that energy is targeted at you. Non stop. It&amp;rsquo;s a completely transcendent experience. At times I felt like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t running and they were just carrying my sore legs along. I came close to tears on Tower Bridge with the location and the &amp;ldquo;moment&amp;rdquo;. I nearly lost it completely at mile 23 with the emotional impact of all the crowds and the music and the pain and the encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know London well, I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked there. My semi-regular visits have never really given me a feeling for the place. On Sunday I think I saw the real London. I saw the soul of an amazing city. Where every area from the poorest to the richest was loudly willing you to succeed. Where everyone from the most ultra athlete to overweight people blobs like me were given the same encouragement and love from hundreds of thousands of people for 6 hours plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing that line is a life moment that&amp;rsquo;s now burned into my mind forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/conor_marathon_finish_line.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Marathon Finish Line&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve run races in Amsterdam, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry and Wexford. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched my wife run more in Paris and Rome. None of them, none, come even close to what happened on the streets of London. My time is irrelevant, you can&amp;rsquo;t measure the effect that day had on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now finally know why many people rate it as the greatest of all the major marathons. It&amp;rsquo;s got nothing to do with the route. It&amp;rsquo;s taking part in an incredible experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/conor_marathon_end.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Marathon End&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t need a bucket list. I&amp;rsquo;ve done London. Thank you Londoners.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So long WordPress. Hello Hexo.</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2015/03/05/hello-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2015 08:48:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2015/03/05/hello-world/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging longer than the average bear, with my first post wayyyy back in 2001 on Blogger. I moved to WordPress in 2005 and did a huge amount of stuff with it both personally and professionally until 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, like many people, I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with WordPress. Pretty much every WP blog I either ran or had some dealings with, has been hacked. Whether through security-hole-riddled plugins, xmlrpc.php or other bugs in WP. I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to constantly update eveything and hope it&amp;rsquo;s alright. The botnets relentlessly trying to login to all of the blogs and managing to mini-DDoS me on a regular basis are just the pooh on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So over the past 2 years I&amp;rsquo;ve moved most of my blogs and sites to static setups. Good old HTML, CSS and JS without a whiff of PHP or MySQL. This has been a huge success for me and I simply don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about any of those sites. I&amp;rsquo;ve popped the images up on S3 for performance too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tool of choice for all of this has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://harpjs.com/&#34;&gt;Harp&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy with it apart from the very long generation time with each new post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.net&#34;&gt;conoroneill.net&lt;/a&gt;. Basically it re-generates the entire site for every new post/page. And with close to 1000 posts there, that takes 5+ minutes even on an 8-core machine (presumably because it&amp;rsquo;s doing them all sequentially).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when it came time to kill my last install of WordPress here on conoroneill.com, I decided to see what else was out there in the &amp;ldquo;Node.js Static Site Generation Tool&amp;rdquo; world. And I quickly found &lt;a href=&#34;http://hexo.io/&#34;&gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hexo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hexo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hexo is a fairly new static blogging platform from Taiwan that seems to have built a community very quickly. It is very easy to use/setup and has import tools for the usual suspects including WordPress. The latter had a one-line bug which I fixed and they have merged already. Getting all of the old posts from WordPress involved taking the export file from WP and running it through the Hexo migration tool a few times and making some fixes. It found a few problems like dodgy markup from old WP plugins and a crazy number of categories/tags. A bit ot search/replace fixing in Notepad++ sorted that out and I got a clean import working with very little effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how quickly it generates static pages and the general ease of use and configuration but obviously you have to be comfortable using Command Line tools and editing Markdown if you want to use it. However, if you are sick of the WP treadmill, it may be a solution for you too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Please someone make a documentary on TB hospitals in Ireland</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2014/02/01/please-someone-make-a-documentary-on-tb-hospitals-in-ireland/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2014 18:41:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2014/02/01/please-someone-make-a-documentary-on-tb-hospitals-in-ireland/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.com/2009/01/17/tb-hospitals-in-ireland/&#34;&gt;a quick throwaway post&lt;/a&gt; about TB hospitals in Ireland. For whatever reason it bubbles up very close to the top of any google search on that topic. As a result, I have set of comments there which just have to be read. All of them are interesting, many are heartbreaking. The majority are written by people who were either in such a hospital or had a relation in one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peamount.ie&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/the-administration-building-circa-1913.png&#34; alt=&#34;the-administration-building-circa-1913&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implore someone to take this information and do a proper documentary on it before it&amp;rsquo;s too late and all of these people are gone. These stories have been hidden for far too long, just like so many other parts of our 20th century history in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anyone out there up to the task?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two lovely hot sauces from Mexico</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2014/01/01/two-lovely-hot-sauces-from-mexico/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 17:21:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2014/01/01/two-lovely-hot-sauces-from-mexico/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, I know. I spent most of 2013 focused on &lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.net/&#34;&gt;my tech blog over here&lt;/a&gt;. But I thought I&amp;rsquo;d kick off 2014 with a foodie post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a lot of hot sauce but tend to be very boring in the ones I buy, mainly sticking to the supermarket reliables like Tabasco and Encona. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the odd Irish one too but many of them seem obsessed with heat and not flavour (Rebel Chilli being the worst culprit here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.com/2006/03/31/buffalo-wings-mmm-tasty-but-not-so-hot/&#34;&gt;most spammed blogposts here&lt;/a&gt; is the one I did on Frank&amp;rsquo;s Hot Sauce back in 2006. However I&amp;rsquo;ve long given up on Franks due to the lack of kick and depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://qz.com/132738/the-highly-unusual-company-behind-siracha-the-worlds-coolest-hot-sauce/&#34;&gt;read an article about the Sriracha&lt;/a&gt; obsession in the US. It lead me to believe that only one company in California was responsible for it and the distinct bottle. But their company name bears no resemblance to the one in my fridge, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how accurate anything they said was. I only use Sriracha in kebabs (I know, culture clash) as I find it a bit a too raw-garlic-smelly. Then I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://pando.com/2013/12/12/lets-face-it-sriracha-isnt-that-good/&#34;&gt;this great piece on Pando daily&lt;/a&gt;, giving Sriracha a good kicking and recommending some alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ones he mentioned that stood out for me were by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elyucateco.com/&#34;&gt;El Yucateco&lt;/a&gt; and I found a bunch of places online selling them without too big a gouge to Ireland. So I ordered their Chipotle Hot Sauce and Green Chile Habanero Hot Sauce &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/El-Yucateco-Chipotle-Hot-Sauce-/131057906997?ssPageName=ADME:L:OU:IE:3160&#34;&gt;off eBay&lt;/a&gt;.  And boy am I glad I did. The Chipotle is a bit too smokey straight out of the bottle on to your finger, but it does some sort of crazy transformation the second it hits food. Everything tastes better, everything! It must be packed with umami. It&amp;rsquo;s not very hot but adds depth and some heat to spruce up even the most boring of foods. The Habanero is very hot, but not madly so. It is lovely and fresh and adds a lot of zing. A great replacement for Tabasco or Encona everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2013-12-22-13.52.52.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2013-12-22-13.52.52.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2013-12-22 13.52.52&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try them out. I&amp;rsquo;ll be ordering more soon as I&amp;rsquo;m nearly out already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poacher&#39;s Inn Tapas Night. Staggeringly good. Epic in fact.</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2013/03/03/poachers-inn-tapas-night-staggeringly-good-epic-in-fact/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2013 12:51:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2013/03/03/poachers-inn-tapas-night-staggeringly-good-epic-in-fact/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a good few years, this blog was all about food. I had lots of restaurant reviews and foodie pics and experiments like making sausages. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much in that area for a long time. Whilst I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten lots of lovely food since then, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much that was truly memorable. Until Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents were down for a visit and we planned to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/poachersinnbandon&#34;&gt;The Poacher&amp;rsquo;s Inn&lt;/a&gt; with them and big sis, but when we went to book we were told the Tapas night was starting at 8pm and it was only a very limited menu before that. As we hate to eat late, we decided to go to Bandon&amp;rsquo;s other superb restaurant, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chapelsteps.ie/&#34;&gt;Chapel Steps&lt;/a&gt;. We figured it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too busy around 6.30pm and we didn&amp;rsquo;t bother book a table. Boy were we wrong. They were jammed and didn&amp;rsquo;t have a table free when we arrived. Whilst it was a disappointment for us, I was thrilled for Siobhan and the team. They&amp;rsquo;ve got an absolute winner on their hands now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back to Poacher&amp;rsquo;s and not only did they have a table, they were happy to give us the Tapas menu early. I was chuffed! We ordered a clatter of plates for sharing. We knew we had to be out by 8pm and were relieved when the plates started coming thick and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a single dud. Not one. Everything was gorgeous and lots of it was surprising. The tempura oysters with pepper sauce were a revelation. The sauce on the whole prawns was completely addictive. I could go on and on about the tastes but I think a few pictures are called for. Apologies for the rubbish picture quality. It was quite dark and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the option to turn on the flash as a light in the camera app on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superb olives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WXXLWcHPyxI/UTD7IJ3cJ2I/AAAAAAAAkq8/CV0fPT7ytHk/s641/IMG_20130301_190035.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local cheeses and meats (that pickled cauliflower was a thing of joy):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vLEHN2PX-Qs/UTD6-pvpD9I/AAAAAAAAkqk/KpFEJJR9vwE/s855/IMG_20130301_190022.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite share plate. Everything on this was perfect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pWLSYm4SfWE/UTD86ozsreI/AAAAAAAAkrQ/_3gQejEpjhE/s855/IMG_20130301_190351.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest surprise for those who thought they didn&amp;rsquo;t like oysters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XsncxdffvyM/UTEAh1QgXpI/AAAAAAAAkrg/kBPB2HkXWO4/s855/IMG_20130301_192402.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incredible sauce. I need that recipe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FWqsqV7S_zw/UTEAxAm3DuI/AAAAAAAAkr4/564m5NNn76M/s855/IMG_20130301_192450.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful brill with patatas bravas (best pickled artichoke ever):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WG8QAAbQOOM/UTECxwJtRqI/AAAAAAAAksI/UlLzS2dpnvs/s855/IMG_20130301_192718.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 7.30pm I think we&amp;rsquo;d tried everything on the menu. And then we had the desserts. That thing with the granita was the nicest sweet I&amp;rsquo;ve had in years. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ipFvK8jjL7s/UTEGiIUyaKI/AAAAAAAAks8/AnWw4qweVYA/s855/IMG_20130301_195005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The others raved about this dessert too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_ltlpymRHMc/UTEGaqI8t7I/AAAAAAAAksw/-E1O-vkOq3Y/s855/IMG_20130301_194858.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rory told us that it was just a one-off experiment but can I implore Poacher&amp;rsquo;s to do this regularly? I know it had 5 chefs flat-out all night Friday so maybe once a month? And have it all night rather than the big-bang at 8pm? We haven&amp;rsquo;t eaten out much recently and it&amp;rsquo;s food like this that will get us out the door regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first moved to Bandon, we were told that there were no good restaurants here because it was too close to Cork. So everyone went to Cork or Kinsale to eat. But Urru, Poacher&amp;rsquo;s and Chapel Steps have proven that was bullcrap and was just an excuse for mediocrity in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we get another couple of places of this quality in the town, it will become a serious foodie destination and rightly call itself the new gourmet capital of Cork.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doing something about bullying - Tuairisc</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2013/01/29/doing-something-about-bullying-tuairisc/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 09:07:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2013/01/29/doing-something-about-bullying-tuairisc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brian Greene contacted me last week about a new project he has just launched called &lt;a href=&#34;https://tuairisc.me/&#34;&gt;Tuairisc.me&lt;/a&gt;. Like many good ideas, it&amp;rsquo;s brilliantly simple. It&amp;rsquo;s an anti-bullying form for school web-sites that can be added with a single line of HTML to any site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tuairisc.me/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tuairsc-logo-wide.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;tuairsc-logo-wide&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent some questions/thoughts over to Brian and his responses convinced me that this thing has legs. But it will only work if as many people as possible know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are a parent, a teacher or even a student, let&amp;rsquo;s make this happen for your school. Get them to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://tuairisc.me/&#34;&gt;Tuairisc.me&lt;/a&gt;, sign the school up for the FREE service and grab that one line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the school gets stuck adding the code, I&amp;rsquo;m sure many people, including me, would be glad to figure it out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then get the message out. If your school uses SMS, send one. If it uses school-bag paper-slips, use that. Put posters in the school telling kids they can safely and securely report bullying via the school&amp;rsquo;s site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tuairisc.me/&#34;&gt;Tuairisc&lt;/a&gt; is another perfect example of a motivated tech person getting us from &amp;ldquo;someone should do something about this&amp;rdquo; to actually doing something about it. I hope we see many more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ballincollig&#39;s permanent Orienteering Trail points the way for all West Cork towns</title>
      <link>http://conoroneill.com/2013/01/14/ballincolligs-permanent-orienteering-trail-points-the-way-for-all-west-cork-towns/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2013 14:02:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://conoroneill.com/2013/01/14/ballincolligs-permanent-orienteering-trail-points-the-way-for-all-west-cork-towns/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently did a short family outing to the forest in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/?id=53andrec_site=16&#34;&gt;Castlefreke&lt;/a&gt; just before the kids went back to school. Whilst the walk itself was fun and short enough to avoid the kids complaining too much, it brought up a ton of questions and ideas in my head, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is it so hard to find detailed information about walks/trails in West Cork and the rest of the country? The Irish Trails site is very poor indeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is Coillte sticking to unreadable-by-normal-people Ordnance Survey type &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/?id=53andrec_site=16&#34;&gt;maps in PDF format&lt;/a&gt; in 2013?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t Coillte have iPhone and Android Apps for all forest activities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t such an App be a perfect positive example of The Gathering in action?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t Google Streetview tours of the walks/trails/forests be an amazing resource?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why can&amp;rsquo;t I tell from online info if a walk/trail is buggy-friendly or small-child friendly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is signage in Irish forests so utterly useless?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are we talking about selling off our forests rather than turning them into strong tourism revenue generators?
In the case of Castlefreke, rather than just complaining, I turned on a GPS tracker on my phone during the walk and uploaded much improved data to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.572699546813965andlon=-8.965208530426025andzoom=15&#34;&gt;Open Street Map&lt;/a&gt; afterwards. I&amp;rsquo;d do the same on Google Maps but they don&amp;rsquo;t have a Map Maker for Ireland yet. (Aside: Sign-up to be notified when it happens &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/google-mapmaker/wiki/MappingIE&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.572699546813965andlon=-8.965208530426025andzoom=15&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://conoroneill.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rathbarry.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;rathbarry&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our next walk, my plan is to take a Contour GPS camera and video the whole thing with location info. So future walkers can see exactly what a trail is like rather than relying on vague text descriptions on web-sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was a real joy for me to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://ballincollig.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/ballincollig-regional-park-orienteering-course-and-trails/&#34;&gt;Margaret Jordan&amp;rsquo;s blogpost&lt;/a&gt; this morning about the new permanent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.corko.net/ballincollig_poc&#34;&gt;Orienteering Trail&lt;/a&gt; in Ballincollig Regional Park.  I did a bit of orienteering as a kid in the Scouts and absolutely loved it. It turned forest walks into an exciting adventure. It&amp;rsquo;s a sport that people of every age and ability can do. The one in Ballincollig sounds perfect for families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you think about what&amp;rsquo;s involved, the cost to add this feature to any recreation space is very small. You could transform many barely used forests into hives of activity. But huge kudos to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cafechico.ie/&#34;&gt;Cafe Chico&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring the one in Ballincollig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Bandon is now an &amp;ldquo;Active Travel town&amp;rdquo; and funding has supposedly been allocated for walking and cycling routes, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t orienteering be an ideal and inexpensive way of achieving the aims of that initiative? I know we don&amp;rsquo;t have many forests locally. I once tried to go for a walk in Duke&amp;rsquo;s wood and failed miserably after a few yards. I wonder if Castlebernard would be amenable to such a thing? Or Manch? Are there other places, not necessarily forests where this could be done safely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rest of West Cork there are plenty of areas where orienteering could slot right in. Imagine Lough Hyne or similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts? Problems? Suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 1: I just noticed from the Cork Orienteering Club site that Farran has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.corko.net/maps&#34;&gt;a permanent course&lt;/a&gt; too. That&amp;rsquo;s two weekends sorted for us now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 2 (20/01/2013): Today we had a go at the course in Ballincollig. We printed off 7 maps and the guide and got our warm clothes on. Overall we had good fun despite the usual kids complaints. But (big but!), you have to do it in wellies at this time of year. Most of the route is either off-path or on mud-filled paths. We did a short loop of the first 6 markers or so and were very mucky by the end. It&amp;rsquo;s not really suitable for people with buggies or very small children. Also if you want to split up into teams, there are a lot of rivers/streams/pools which means small kids must be accompanied by someone with sense. Highly recommended tho!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
