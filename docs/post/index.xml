      <description>The Unlockdowning As we approached the partial lifting of pandemic lockdown in Ireland in late March 2021, I wanted to celebrate in some way that involved trails, hills and running. Luckily for me, the brilliant Tough Soles published a new summary video on YouTube of their Sheep&amp;rsquo;s Head Way hiking trip from 2018. I was immediately sold.
The route The official Way web-site has a ton of useful info including a trace of the whole route.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in maximising the lifetime of electronics. I detest built-in obsolescence and I hate the way computers are becoming impossible to upgrade or repair yourself. Apple is the absolute worst culprit in this area and their actions result in others following their terrible example.
Apple&amp;rsquo;s logic is that phones and computers should be like TVs and no-one ever upgrades or repairs their TV. Except, we used to. I still remember the RTV Rentals man coming to our house to replace the tuner in our TV as the existing one couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the signal of my new ZX Spectrum.</description>

      <description>In January 2020, I went 99.9% plant-based as a way of kick-starting serious weight loss after 20 years of being either overweight or obese. The only initial exception was cow milk in my tea. I did similar back in 2016 but that was my silly &amp;ldquo;6 Day Vegan&amp;rdquo; plan where I ate chicken curry on a Friday. Both times I&amp;rsquo;ve used Veganuary as the starting point.
After two months at 99.</description>

      <description>Has it really been 13 months since I did a personal blogpost? So many things I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to share over the past year but never got around to. I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to do my annual race/run wrap-up post over Christmas and I really want to get back into the regular blogging saddle since I&amp;rsquo;ve left Twitter and Facebook long behind.
And speaking of the two hellsites, this post by Sabrina Little on iRunFar is a perfect summary of how I have been feeling about online (and real-world) discourse over the past few years.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been calling Twitter the Hate Machine and LinkedIn a Roach Motel for a long time. But they both really came up trumps with my EI123 blogpost.
Unsurprisingly it turns out that IAG airlines have been treating passengers like garbage all over Europe and they are getting worse by the day. I received a large number of stories both publicly and privately that show a company which seems to detest the people who keep them in business.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite sights in Ireland is when I&amp;rsquo;m driving south on the M8 motorway and the Galtee Mountains appear on the horizon. At certain times of the year and day, it&amp;rsquo;s breathtaking.
The 16yo and I had a fine time out there earlier in the year with Bandon Hillwalking Club on their Open Day but I wanted to find out how much of it was runnable by someone like me.</description>

      <description>Buckle up, this is going to be the rantiest rant I&amp;rsquo;ve written in years. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly about getting it off my chest as, based on our experiences over October 5th and 6th, it will have zero effect on the dire state of Aer Lingus.
Let&amp;rsquo;s do the timeline first and then dive into the death of once-well-regarded brand.
An early start but lots of excitement My wife, 5 kids and I woke at 4.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Google Cardboard, you can still get some sense of the scale of what Alex Honnold achieved this year when he free soloed El Capitan in Yosemite if you use the 3D controls in YouTube.
Free Soloing is climbing without any equipment or safety ropes. What Alex did is one of the greatest sporting achievements by a human ever.
   I&amp;rsquo;ve no massive interest in climbing but after watching the Valley Uprising documentary last night (available to buy or watch or Netflix), I have a whole new appreciation for the mindset and philosophy of people like Honnold and John Bachar before him.</description>

      <description>Mario nailed it, as always, in his weekly newsletter. You should subscribe.
&amp;ldquo;I understand the disbelief and the need to explain what many deemed impossible without some kind of assistance. But what if, at the end of the day, as Alex Hutchinson wrote for Outside, it was all Kipchoge? What if we were simply watching the greatest distance runner of all-time painting his masterpiece in real-time? What if we were witnessing the greatest feat of human endurance in history?</description>

      <description>Apart from a couple like the Liverpool to Manchester 50 miler, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping up on my mini race reports over the past year. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll find them useful if you&amp;rsquo;re planning for next year. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep them short and sweet.
New York City Marathon I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whey I never did a full race report on this because it was an incredible experience. It overtook London as the marathon that emotionally impacted me the most.</description>

      <description>Love them or hate them as a company, but wow Nike knows how to make amazing ads. It&amp;rsquo;d almost make me buy a pair of Epic Reacts to balance the redneck backlash in the US.
  And these selfless people just blow my mind:

      <description>The Kerry Ultra 50K was somehow not on my radar but luckily my wife spotted it recently. We decided to do it barely a week beforehand.
Unlike a lot of ultras over in the UK, this one was all on-road and mostly self-supported. There was a small table every 10K with water and Redbull only.
We went down to Tralee the night before to make the race briefing. Brian O&amp;rsquo;Shea went into huge detail on both the 50K and 100K which weirdly made me more stressed than if I&amp;rsquo;d known nothing.</description>

      <description>As always, amazing coverage from the iRunFar crew who deserve all your Patreon support. I was thrilled to get some of their stickers in the post this week. I also wear my iRunFar t-shirt as often as possible.
Their interview with women&amp;rsquo;s winner Francesca Canepa:

and men&amp;rsquo;s winner Xavier Thévenard:

I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to spend time near Chamonix next year to finally check out those amazing trails.</description>

      <description>As a 12 year old kid, the ads for Breaking Glass looked amazing. Somehow I never watched it until tonight.
It hasn&amp;rsquo;t aged well. From the general cheapness to the ropey writing, acting and directing, it should be awful. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s lovely. Hazel O&amp;rsquo;Connor, Hazel&amp;rsquo;s songs and Hazel&amp;rsquo;s voice remain utterly unique.
The movie is also a reminder that no matter how bad things are now, they aren&amp;rsquo;t half as bad as the late 70s and early 80s.</description>

      <description>The organisers of UTMB (Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc) do an amazing job of the coverage every year. Head over to their site at 5pm Irish on Friday Aug 31st for live footage at the race start. In the meantime here&amp;rsquo;s a lovely video by Salomon of brilliant ultra runner Ryan Sandes and his buddies doing a tour of Mont Blanc.

      <description>I have created a simple new tool which enables me to send blog
content via email. The emails are converted to Markdown files and then
uploaded to a Hugo source repo on GitHub, along with any inline images.
CircleCI then automatically rebuilds and redeploys my blog to S3.
I’ll post full details and source code over the next few days.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write about giving up on Twitter since last November. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll now wait until I&amp;rsquo;ve been off for 12 months.
I kept threatening to walk on Facebook too. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank Facebook for killing the List Feed feature today so they made the decision for me. I&amp;rsquo;m done.
My first two posts on Facebook were in 2006 and 2007. I was complaining about it even then!</description>

      <title>Castlefreke is exactly why all State lands must be immediately be removed from the hands of logging company Coillte</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get straight to the point. Coillte is a logging company with a commercial mandate. Having it in charge of 440,000 hectares of state lands is so idiotically Irish, you don&amp;rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry. All state lands should be transferred to a hugely expanded and reformulated National Parks and Wildlife Service immediately. The NPWS can then licence Coillte to plant and harvest trees in a strictly controlled fashion on a limited subset of those lands.</description>

      <title>From Liverpool to Manchester - Conor does his 50 (miles) before 50 (years)</title>

      <description>Last March I decided I wanted to run a 50 mile race before I hit the big five oh in May of this year. On Monday, in spite of freezing rain, hail, sleet and snow, I somehow managed it and I can&amp;rsquo;t stop randomly grinning.
As always, have no fear, this won&amp;rsquo;t be a mile-by-mile race report. I&amp;rsquo;d fall asleep writing it :-) Speaking of which, one of my ultra-running top tips is &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to the audiobook of &amp;lsquo;Why We Sleep&amp;rsquo; on miles 30-40 of a 50 miler if you want to avoid getting verrrrry verrrry sleepy.</description>

      <description>Like many people I&amp;rsquo;ve been enthralled by Eoin Keith&amp;rsquo;s Ultra running exploits since I first discovered this crazy sport. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s his Spine Race wins in crazy weather or his FKT from Mizen to Malin, he makes you want to push yourself and try things.
My wife and I are doing the Liverpool to Manchester 50 Mile Ultra very soon (oh god it really is very very soon) and we flip-flop between terror and huge excitement over the adventure.</description>
