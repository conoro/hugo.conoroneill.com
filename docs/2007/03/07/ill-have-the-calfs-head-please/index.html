<p>A bunch of us geeks attended the pretty weak Le Web 3 conference in December 2006. The main party was on near l&rsquo;Opera and we wanted to get something decent to eat (we&rsquo;d had a Chinese the previous night!).</p>
<p>Jan from <a href="http://www.touristr.com/">Touristr</a> is French and knew of an &ldquo;institution&rdquo; called Au Petit Riche which has been around since the mid 1800&rsquo;s. It was only a few minutes from the incredible Haussmann animated shop-window Christmas display which made the Switzers/BT display look like a sad joke!</p>
<p>I was immediately impressed by the stall outside the restaurant selling Oysters.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/323910127/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/142/323910127_9be2ad0d32_m.jpg" alt="Au Petit Riche Restaurant"></a></p>
<p>It turns out that the people selling them have been supplying the restaurant for generations. Could you imagine something so cool outside an Irish place?</p>
<p>Inside was broken into large booths with maybe four tables in each. A giant cheese sat on the counter. The waiters were grumpy which made me happy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/323909209/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/140/323909209_f0e38108c6_m.jpg" alt="Au Petit Riche Restaurant"></a></p>
<p>There was no problem seating the 6 of us.</p>
<p>The menus came out and I realised they served traditional classic French food; escargot, fois gras, tete de vache, oysters. I drooled. Then I saw the fixed price menu cost - â‚¬30! I was gobsmacked. All of us went with it except Joe who wanted the fois gras and who will probably be stabbed by Keith the next time he meets him ;-)</p>
<p>I went with snails to start which were awesome, dripping in garlic butter in one of those compartmentalised dishes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/323908011/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/132/323908011_eacf20ce97_m.jpg" alt="Au Petit Riche Restaurant"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately I decided to be adventurous and have the calf&rsquo;s head for main. This was a mix of cheek, tongue and brain. It came out in a mini crock-pot thing and was basically a watery stew with those components and some veg along with a nice side gribbiche sauce.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/323908181/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/323908181_2b8ec712a0_m.jpg" alt="Au Petit Riche Restaurant"></a></p>
<p>The problem was that most of the meat was wobbly non-rendered fat and just wasn&rsquo;t very appetising. I was glad to try it but won&rsquo;t do it again. Brains were fine!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/323908355/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/125/323908355_1daa64cd08_m.jpg" alt="Au Petit Riche Restaurant"></a></p>
<p>We nearly all went with the creme brulee which was killer - one of the best ever. Great coffee too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/323908832/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/144/323908832_685f4f90aa_m.jpg" alt="Au Petit Riche Restaurant"></a></p>
<p>The highlight for me was the fun we had with the wine. I was brow beating Jan about how the French approach of having 16-word titles on wine had no hope of working in the modern world where the Aussies just said &ldquo;Shiraz&rdquo;. He argued that there is far more to wine than the grape and that needed to be highlighted on the bottle. Yes terroir came up.</p>
<p>The waiter gave Jan the wine menu and to his credit he admitted defeat! It consisted of maybe 8 or 9 sections. Within each section was a type of wine and then just a list like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>2004 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil La Coudraye</li>
<li>2003 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Les Quartiers</li>
<li>2004 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Tin Pan Alley</li>
<li>2003 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Yama Lama Ding Dong</li>
<li>2004 Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Nanoo Nanoo</li>
</ul>
<p>Over and over.</p>
<p>I asked him what the difference between each one was and he didn&rsquo;t know. He called over the waiter who was similarly stumped. He called the sommelier and had a detailed chat of which I caught a tiny part. The sommelier had narrowed it down to Yannick Amirault Bourgueil La Coudrayeand Yannick Amirault Bourgueil Les Quartiers.</p>
<p>I said &ldquo;Jan please tell me that I misheard and he didn&rsquo;t say that the only difference between those two wines is the side of the valley they were grown on in the vineyard.&rdquo;. Oh yes indeedy! However the sommelier had described the differences between them. One fruitier, the other more dry etc. So we got one and enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/323909008/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/129/323909008_6b55152964_m.jpg" alt="Au Petit Riche Restaurant"></a></p>
<p>My googling afterwards showed that it is a very highly regarded but inexpensive Cabernet Franc from the Touraine region of the Loire Valley.</p>
<p>We finished the first bottle and then agreed we would try the other variant &ldquo;just to see&rdquo;. Conor is a donkey - we could all bloody tell the difference and none of us are wine experts. Wow! Sodding Aussies have been conning us for twenty years.</p>
<p>Only problem is that my brain is too small to remember all the French info.</p>
<p>Back to the restaurant. Great great food in a lovely location with a killer price. If you are around l&rsquo;Opera in Paris, you should definitely give it a go.</p>
