      <p>Saturday was showery and windy but that didn&rsquo;t seem to deter the crowds to the Farmer&rsquo;s Market in Bandon. I popped down with big sis Fiona and babba Fionn. Before I headed out I had been reading a great article on the &ldquo;old&rdquo; market in the Bandon Opinion. Well worth seeking out, particularly for the description of the overwhelming stench of s***te that used to accompany the market in the old days.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/141806054/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/55/141806054_9ece075501_m.jpg" alt="Farmer" /></a></p>

<p>I took along my new N70 to snap a few pictures but I only managed to take a few. Apologies to any stall owners who have not been photographed yet.</p>

<p>First stop was the Baking Emporium from Dunmanway. These people make one of my fave products which we buy all the time in supermarkets around Cork - crisp breads. But these are not your average ryvita, they are packed full of flavour and texture and make the basis for a great lunch. There were none of those on display yesterday, just a great selection of interesting looking breads and cakes. I heard one of the people behind the stall say &ldquo;nay&rdquo; to one of the others. &ldquo;ah, they must be Dutch&rdquo; I thought. Then they spoke more and I realised they were German. I guessed they might be Schwabisch from the &ldquo;nay&rdquo;. Sure enough, the customer beside me said &ldquo;my husband will be thrilled to hear you are here. He is from Stuttgart too&rdquo;. It turns out she was also German and a big chat auf Deutsch ensued. I stood there remembering the summer of 1988 when a bunch of student engineers from UCD headed to Stuttgart, stayed in a campsite near <a href="http://www.gottlieb-daimler-stadion.de/stadion_en.htm">Neckar Stadion</a> for a while, then got rooms in a studenten wohnheim and worked in the kitchens of an altenheim outside <a href="http://www.esslingen.de/servlet/PB/menu/-1/index.html">Esslingen</a>. I bought some lovely rye bread and mini-tarts. I had a sambo later with the bread and further reminiscences of salami sandwich breakfasts came to mind!</p>

<p>I was gasping for a cup of coffee and the Cork Coffee Roasters stall was exactly what we needed. Great lattes and some fine looking biscotti and kettle popcorn too. I got some of their ground coffeee the previous time from Urru but forgot yesterday. Dumbass.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/141805882/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/49/141805882_98b405e781_m.jpg" alt="Cork Coffee Roasters" /></a></p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t got to Sonia&rsquo;s Pickles the last time and made a beeline yesterday. She gave me some tastes of ones involving peppers, aubergines and pinenuts. It was a tough choice and many could be bought in either nice looking jars or bigger plastic tubs for the same money. I got two types and sis got a lovely looking rosewater jelly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/141806034/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/55/141806034_04a34af221_m.jpg" alt="Sonia" /></a></p>

<p>After not spotting them the last time, there now seemed to be eggs everywhere! I got some fine looking free range O&rsquo;Briens ones. Fiona got some chicken liver pate from the same blokes.</p>

<p>I rounded the visit off with more super-delish choccies from Gwen&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Sis bought some great veg which had the reassuring mud still on them. Her only negative comment, which I agreed with, was that it was a pity that there are no fresh meat vendors there. There are guys who do their own organic beef at Skibb and Midleton. It&rsquo;d be great to get similar in Bandon. Is there also a guy over near Aherla who has a big Duck and Goose farm? I&rsquo;m sure they would be popular.</p>

<p>It really does look like the market is getting better and better. All of the new stands add to the breadth of goods on sale and I think it has already become an integral part of the Saturday shopping for a lot of people. Roll on the next one in two weeks time.</p>
