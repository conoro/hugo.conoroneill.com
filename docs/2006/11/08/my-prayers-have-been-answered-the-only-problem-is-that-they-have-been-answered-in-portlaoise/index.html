<abbr title="5" class="rating">&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;</abbr> Well over a year ago, I blogged about [the lack of burger innovation](http://conoroneill.com/2005/06/25/burger-innovation-in-ireland/) in Ireland. I recently did a pit stop at the new Midway Food Court on the M7/M8 split outside Portlaoise but was disappointed to only find O'Brien's open. I went back again on Monday to grab a quick sambo and noticed that one new place was open - "[Real Gourmet Burger](http://www.realgourmetburger.ie/)". I ran as fast as a fat man can to the counter and was handed a menu. Tears of joy welled up in my eyes as I read "original chargrilled burger with red onion and tomato relish", "lamb burger with mozzarella and pesto" "spicy chorzio sausage..... I had to sit down to compose myself.

It's a lovely setup with disposable wooden cutlery and recycled cardboard trays and beautiful seats. I ended up plumping for a guacamole burger "zesty guacamole, aged Irish cheddar, crispy pancetta and tomato relish", chunky chips and a latte which came to a bit over â‚¬14\. That is pricey but it was more of a dinner than a lunch and all the ingredients are top quality. The burger was fabulous  in a bun by the Bretzel Bakery but I'd have preferred it a smidge less well done (they quote it as medium). Chips were fab and the coffee made O'Brien's look like a bad paddy joke. It does take 15 mins to get the burger but it is well worth the wait. I was the only diner at 12 midday just after opening but a few more had arrived by 12.30\. 

This is fast food done right and I hope hope hope that enough people become regulars to allow them to grow into an empire that stretches to at least Cork. If you live in the midlands or are going anywhere on the N7/N8, this is a must-try.

Their web-site is just a holding page right now. If anyone is interested, I'll scan the menu and post it here. I'm sure they won't mind a bit of copyright infringement if it drives some business their way.
