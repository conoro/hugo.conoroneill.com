<p>A few weeks back we took a run to Skibbereen to see if there was anything special in the Farmer&rsquo;s Market with the <a href="http://www.skibbereen.ie/taste-of-west-cork.htm">Taste of West Cork Food Festival</a> being on. Sadly it seemed to be the usual fare with a few great stalls including the awesome Gubbeen stand along with the standard crusties selling knitted bodhrans. We were very disappointed and I&rsquo;ve only just realised from reading the web-site that the big food event was on the Sunday - damn damn damn.</p>

<p>We tootled off to Union Hall for some grub and had three pubs to choose from. We randomly selected Dinty&rsquo;s which is a lovely airy pub and was not too busy yet (around 12.30). The barman was friendly and good with the kids and I grabbed a few menus off him. I was immediatley very disappointed by the selection of seafood for a few reasons. They call themselves a seafood restaurant, they have a picture of lobster on their sign outside, they are 20 yards from an awesome fish shop and wholesalers (Antcar) and they are in a fishing port!</p>

<p>I went with fish pie whilst Catherine and the kids all had plaice plus a few rounds of chips. I have to hand it to them, they broke the current record holder for getting fish to people in a pub who have kids by a couple of minutes. Up until now that record was held by the Bosun in Monkstown which is a fantastic pub/restaurant. I think Dinty&rsquo;s did it in under 4 minutes which meant the kids didn&rsquo;t even have a chance to think about misbehaving. They know their stuff in this place.</p>

<p>My fish pie was good but the plaice was superb - top top quality and ultra fresh from what I could see. A few leaves on the plate were dressed well but they shouldn&rsquo;t have bothered with it for the kiddies. Chips excellent.</p>

<p>Lunch/Dinner for two adults and 3.5 kids plus one pint and soft drinks came to over â‚¬60 which I found pricey. By the time we were leaving the place was mobbed and with good reason. Recommended for good solid food. Next time we&rsquo;ll try the other places and compare.</p>
