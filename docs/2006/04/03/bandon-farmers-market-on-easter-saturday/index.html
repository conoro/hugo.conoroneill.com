<p><strong>Begins</strong>: <abbr class='dtstart' title='2006-04-15T10:00:00'>Sat, 15 Apr 2006 at 10:00 AM</abbr></p>

<pre><code> **Location**:      &lt;span class='location'&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Old Market Garden
</code></pre>

<p>Bandon,      Co Cork</p>

<p>Ireland
    </span></p>       <div></p>

<p>I was thrilled to receive an email from Dianne Curtin, one of the organisers of the Bandon Farmer&rsquo;s Market and food writer for the very fine Bandon Opinion. She brought up a few points which I&rsquo;ll cover here.</p>

<p>The first is the great news that they have added Easter Saturday as an extra market day and if interest continues, they fully intend to move to weekly. I am really delighted for all the organisers and stall-holders. The feedback I got elsewhere was that business was excellent on the day (rather than just people browsing) and the hope is that the strong buzz will continue.</p>

<p>The second thing that Dianne mentioned was that I was incorrect about the lack of eggs at Saturday&rsquo;s market. She told me that James O&rsquo;Brien from Valley View Free Range Eggs in Bandon had a stall. His eggs are free range, some produced on his farm and the rest on the farms of specially selected farmers in the immediate Bandon locality.</p>

<p>To quote Dianne:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James works to an extremely high standard and his eggs are quite frankly delicious.  He is a smashing guy, a committed food producer and also the founder of the Irish Free Range Egg Producers Association.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am spitting that I missed his stand. I think his may have been one of those that was so mobbed I couldn&rsquo;t get anywhere near it. I&rsquo;ll be stocking up at the next market.</p>

<p>Dianne also mentioned the Ballinscarthy ladies next door to James who had a few trays of their own free range eggs which were snapped up in no time, as were all their home baked cakes made with free range eggs.</p>

<p>I assume these are the &ldquo;Five Ladies From Ballinscarthy&rdquo; that John McKenna mentioned? They should use that as their brand!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to checking out both stalls and all the others I missed the last time.</p>

<p>If you are wondering where the Market is on, have a look at this map on <a href="http://local.live.com/?v=2&amp;sp=aN.51.743760_-8.738509_Bandon%20Farmer%27s%20Market_Mace%20Car%20Park">Microsoft Live Local</a>.</p>

<p>Once again I encourage everyone to attend the Bandon Market whether they live in Bandon, Ballincollig, Ballinspittle, Barryroe, Ballineen, Butlerstown or Boston.</p>
