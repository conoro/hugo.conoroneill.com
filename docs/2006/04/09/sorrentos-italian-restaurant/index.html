<p>Granny Mary was down for a few days and was a wee star to mind the bairns whilst we went out for a quick bite. We both had a hunger on us for steaks and headed towards Paidrigín&rsquo;s which we have never eaten in. They were full. So we tried Broly&rsquo;s to discover that their night-time offering had not lasted and they were shut (a big pity, I really liked what they did). We were flummoxed until I suddenly realised that Sorrento&rsquo;s, the Italian place smack bang in the middle of Bandon, probably did steaks too.</p>
<p>We ate there once over two years ago and were not really impressed but they went under new managment and I have heard some good things in the comments on this blog about it. The menu in the window confirmed a decent selection of steaks.</p>
<p>They were reasonably busy but not full so we got a table. The menu was pretty standard Irish-Italian  fare with Spag Bol, Lasagne etc but they also had a fine looking selection of pizzas, good specials and the steak list really did look good.</p>
<p>To start, Catherine had what was described as foccacia but was actually a hard dough base with tomato etc on top. She didn&rsquo;t think it was very good. Throughout the entire meal, there were people collecting pizzas, so we must check them out with the kids the next time.</p>
<p>I went with the same thing that I always do in an Italian, Antipasta Misto. It was good with salami, parma, chorizo, sun-dried toms, artichokes and these really tasty little preserved mushrooms which I have never had before. It came with a bunch of frissee/rocket type salad which was undressed since they had that old-fashioned (but should have a revival) oil/vinegar combo on the table. Only criticism would be that I&rsquo;d drop the chorizo for something like bresaola or another italian salami.</p>
<p>Catherine changed her mind on the steak and plumped for the creamy monkfish special. I got the Gorgonzola steak. Whilst we were waiting we eyeballed the plates going to all the other tables. Big portions of tasty looking nosh. Ours arrived and were equally big.</p>
<p>The steak came with some baby spuds, more of that salad, a nice ratatouille-style veg mix and the sauce which wasn&rsquo;t as &ldquo;blue&rdquo; tasting as I expected. But the steak, holy cow the steak. I think maybe one of the best I have had in the past year. No joke. A big chewy blood-dripping hunk of cow. Absolutely perfectly cooked. I had asked for sirloin in preference to fillet but I think it might have been rump which is a much tastier cut. The menu said it came from a local craft butcher so it was probably either from Dan or Martin and both of them do really great beef. I relished every mouthful.</p>
<p>Catherine&rsquo;s monkfish was fine but not great. The monkfish had been cut up small rather than being done either as medallions or as one piece. The sauce was a bit heavy too. She did polish it off tho.</p>
<p>We went for the old reliables Tiramisu and Panna Cotta for dessert both of which were good. Two double espressos finished the whole thing nicely.</p>
<p>All through the service was friendly and attentive but not in our faces. I had a glass of house red which was spot-on and the sparkling water was San Pellegrino which I like.</p>
<p>Total came to €78 which is pricey for a local place. If it had come in under €70, I&rsquo;d have been happier. But the reality is that the steak I had last night beat the one given to a dining partner in Isaac&rsquo;s during the week and you&rsquo;ll find Isaac&rsquo;s in most food guides. The Sorrento&rsquo;s one was cheaper, bigger and far better cooked.</p>
<p>This is a local restaurant doing unpretentious, tasty meals with solid ingredients. If you are in Bandon and feel like a decent plate of food, go have a look.</p>
