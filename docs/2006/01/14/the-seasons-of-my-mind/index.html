                <p>We didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;formal&rdquo; family holiday in 2005 - a week in Rosslare</p>
<p>with the extended family was it for us. As year-end approached,</p>
<p>weariness grew. So we threw caution to the wind, threw the children to</p>
<p>their granny and headed down from Cavan to Capital City for some</p>
<p>pampering and unashamed luxury.</p>
<p>Stop reading now if you are offended by the profligate spending by people</p>
<p>of their own money when there are still starving babbies in Biafra</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have a hand knitted scarf yet.</p>
<p>Yes, we stayed and had dinner at the Four Seasons in Ballsbridge. I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been there once before for a business meeting (Pot of Tea for 3 = â‚¬17</p>
<p>if memory serves) and my main recollections were that it was a</p>
<p>butt-ugly building with tons of money spent on fittings and furnishings</p>
<p>to make up for the fact that it looks like an office block. They also</p>
<p>seemed to have an enormous number of staff who didn&rsquo;t appear to do much</p>
<p>apart from smile and say hello.</p>
<p>This time we arrived up in the filthy Zafira and decided not to go for</p>
<p>valet parking beside the Bentleys. To be fair, they did park some</p>
<p>people-carriers (mini-vans/MPVs for my US readers) beside the Porsche</p>
<p>Cayennes. Hard to tell which were more ugly. The Porsche Cayenne - the</p>
<p>SUV for rich people who spell Classy with a K.</p>
<p>Very friendly staff everywhere and if they had any direct dealings with</p>
<p>you, they always knew your name. Actually I found that a bit spooky. No</p>
<p>nose-picking in the lounge or farting in the pool for me then.</p>
<p>A short pause for a moment. To save the numb fingers on my left hand</p>
<p>from RSI, please automatically insert the phrase &ldquo;as well it should at</p>
<p>this price&rdquo; after every sentence from now on.</p>
<p>The room was lovely but not the gold-leaf toilet-paper experience I</p>
<p>thought it might be. Rose petals scattered around the place and a nice</p>
<p>bottle of fizz welcomed us in. Excellent bed and I loved the bathroom</p>
<p>with the all-glass shower. The balcony was cool but the weather meant</p>
<p>it was ununsed.</p>
<p>I had expected the place to be filled with emaciated super-models and</p>
<p>their sugar-daddies with maybe a pack of surgically enhanced peroxided</p>
<p>ladies-who-lunch hunting in the lounge for prey. But actually it mainly</p>
<p>seemed to be perfectly normal looking families with screaming children</p>
<p>which I really liked. They gave the place a comfortable feel which is</p>
<p>missing on first look because of all the Donald Trump style opulence.</p>
<p>Catherine raved about the pool, jacuzzi and whole &ldquo;health centre&rdquo; bit.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you what floor it was on.</p>
<p>We ate there that night and it was an interesting mix of experiences.</p>
<p>Georgina Campbell&rsquo;s guide damned it with faint praise but supposedly</p>
<p>Gerry Ryan is always raving about it. Hmm, now who&rsquo;s judgement would I</p>
<p>trust more? The meal started really badly. A nice greeter person</p>
<p>brought us to our table in the very large almost empty restaurant. And</p>
<p>where did she put us? Beside a table of 15 people including 4 children!</p>
<p>Ahhh, romantic. Dozey bint, surely this is &ldquo;seating 101&rdquo; in Maitre d'</p>
<p>school? So we asked to be moved. The poor waiter dropped a very funny</p>
<p>clunker when he whispers &ldquo;nah, I don&rsquo;t like children either&rdquo;. We</p>
<p>replied that we actually had 4 children but we just didn&rsquo;t want to have</p>
<p>to listen to kids bickering tonight. Poor lad was very embarrased.</p>
<p>The food was really really excellent. A pleasant surprise for me as I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t expecting much. Started with three little amuse bouches which</p>
<p>were all simple but bursting with flavour. Starters were fois gras for</p>
<p>Catherine and for me, a likkle wikkle partridge. Fantastic wee bird.</p>
<p>There was a small white thing on the edge of the plate. Was it what I</p>
<p>thought it was? Ok, now that&rsquo;s funny. A moulded piece of pear. And</p>
<p>before you post a comment about the fois gras, stop, find something</p>
<p>interesting to say about something important (e.g. Darfur) and post it</p>
<p>on another blog instead.</p>
<p>Mains were a very nice steak for me but I can&rsquo;t bloody remember the</p>
<p>details. Three weeks later and I&rsquo;m blank and neither of us can remember</p>
<p>what Catherine had. Desserts were the first ever restaurant souffle for</p>
<p>me and presumably something chocolate for Catherine. The souffle was a</p>
<p>fabulous fruity thing. A nice bottle of some Italian white (no idea</p>
<p>what it was) rounded it all off. I remember the food being superb but</p>
<p>there is something amiss when I cannot remember the details of what the</p>
<p>main courses were. I still remember what I had in Otto&rsquo;s months ago.</p>
<p>Top class food but actually the pricing is totally out of whack. It was</p>
<p>a great meal (one of the best for us in 2005) but it was the most</p>
<p>expensive meal we have ever eaten. For similar money, you could fly to</p>
<p>Cork, get a taxi to Otto&rsquo;s Creative Catering, get the best meal you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>eat all year, stay there overnight and fly back. Or repeat the exercise</p>
<p>to the Tannery in Dungarvan. Yeah I know it is D4 and I know it is The</p>
<p>Four Seasons but it simply does not add up. Just pick one of at least</p>
<p>ten better places to eat in Dublin for a lot less and get a limo to</p>
<p>bring you!</p>
<p>Just at the end of the meal Catherine nudged me and said &ldquo;that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>guy from &lsquo;The Restaurant&rsquo;&rdquo;. For those of you outside Ireland, &ldquo;The</p>
<p>Restaurant&rdquo; is a TV programme where allegedly famous people act as head</p>
<p>chef for a night and reviewers give them scores. A likable programme</p>
<p>and the Maitre d' is a complete scream. Totally over the top camp. And</p>
<p>that was him doing the formal table schmooze in The Four Seasons. He</p>
<p>arrived at our table, asked how everything was and then moved on. We</p>
<p>were disappointed he was so subdued but I guess there is a time and</p>
<p>place for everything.</p>
<p>The following night we ate in O&rsquo;Connells in Bewleys Hotel across the</p>
<p>road. Really simple, excellent food with top quality ingredients. Great</p>
<p>charcuterie platter to start (let me guess, Gubbeen, right?) and</p>
<p>fantastic roast pork loin for main. Remembered that, didn&rsquo;t I? Three</p>
<p>people, two courses each and a bottle of wine. â‚¬85! Is there any better</p>
<p>value in Dublin? Highly recommended. I&rsquo;d also recommend the hotel at</p>
<p>â‚¬99 per family room. The building both inside and outside is fabulous.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;discount&rdquo; hotel outclassing the high-end hotel next door. Genius!</p>
<p>But screw it, for a bit of pure pampering, as a one-off never to be</p>
<p>repeated treat, go spend a night or two at the Four Seasons. It&rsquo;ll cost</p>
<p>ya a bomb but probably less than flying to Majorca on a crappy plane,</p>
<p>staying in a hell hole, eating rubbish, getting sloshed for a fortnight</p>
<p>and getting treatment for skin cancer.</p>
<p>Massive thanks to Granny Mary for minding the childer for our little</p>
<p>post-christmas escape. Hell, I wouldn&rsquo;t offer to mind our kids if they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t mine .</p>
