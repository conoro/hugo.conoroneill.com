    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>About a month ago a guy named Eoin Feeley posted a comment on my July post about 07/07. He asked me to highlight two blogs concerned with a new movie about the genocide in Rwanda called &ldquo;Shooting Dogs&rdquo; starring John Hurt. I was a bit suprised that he referred to my blog as political because apart from the odd dig at Islamo-fascists and their apologists, I mainly talk about food! Start Rant: But I have always been deeply angry about what happened in Rwanda and how the world just stood back and let it happen, just like they are doing all over again in Darfur. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/10/movie-about-rwanda/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned Podchef Neal who is based on an island off Washington State on this blog several times and he posts quite a few comments here too which are always appreciated. I noticed the other day that he is proposing to organise culinary tours of Cork and the surrounding regions this summer. A large number of my readers are foodies so I&rsquo;m guessing this could be of serious interest to some of you. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/07/interesting-culinary-vacation-tours-of-southwest-ireland/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I spent quite a few hours last night working through many of the Event/Calendar sites on the web to see if any of them supported the automated collection of events from blogs which use the hCalendar format in structured blog posts. So far I have found tons of discussion but no actual implementation. Does anyone out there know of a site which does this (or know of one under development)? The ones I checked were: Upcoming: I see quite a few mentions of Upcoming in this context but nothing obvious on the site Meetup: Nothing at all Zvents: Ditto but looks like it might be a fit OpenEvents: Pay only so couldn&rsquo;t find out Eventful: They mention it on the site as coming so fingers crossed. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/07/structured-blogging-event-aggregation/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It had been thought that the sad passing of Peter Crowley, who had been the main driving force behind the setting up of a Farmer&rsquo;s Market in Bandon, would result in the plan being shelved. However, I was thrilled to read in the current edition of the Bandon Opinion that the organizing committee have not given up and Peter&rsquo;s daughter is now involved. The plan is for the market to take place in the Mace Carpark in the middle of town. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/06/bandon-farmers-market-on-the-way/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>No, this isn&rsquo;t a post about accounting. I&rsquo;m trying to do my tiny little bit to help the Structured Blogging effort. To this end I&rsquo;ll be creating a set of pseudo-duplicate posts over the next few days. Each pair will consist of an unstructured &ldquo;normal&rdquo; post and a matching structured one. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be then able to feed the structured ones into some aggregators like kritX and this will provide us with a set of screenshots showing how you can go from randomly organised posts (e.g. <a class="read-more" href="/2006/03/05/double-entries-are-coming/">&raquo;</a></p>
