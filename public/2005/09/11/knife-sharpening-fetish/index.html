    <section class="post-content">
      <p>I have a small obsession with getting my knives very sharp. I think it goes back to my uncle Frank who is a carpenter and who showed me how he sharpened his chisels on a wet-stone when I was a very small kid. From that point on, I was always trying to sharpen knives. I think my first attempt was using Frank&rsquo;s wet-stone on a butter knife. The outcome on that one was very predictable.</p>

<p>Then, as a cub and scout for eight years, I tried everything to get my Swiss Army sharp to no avail. I mainly tried using stones. Total waste of time. I did actually buy a wet-stone in my early teens but had no idea how to use it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/42378499/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/29/42378499_1e94d5a2ba_m.jpg" alt="bc8" /></a></p>

<p>As I got older and into my twenties, the obsession moved to kitchen knives. I tried and failed to use a standard steel a bit like this Wusthof:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/42377101/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/28/42377101_d45558ac3e_o.gif" alt="CL_4474-26cm honing" /></a></p>

<p>Then I got the classic Kitchen Devils &ldquo;mini crossed steels&rdquo; sharpener. I think this was the first one where I actually got a result. The knives were never razor sharp but they were always able to do a reasonable job.</p>

<p>Then I hit the motherlode with the rotating disk sharpener (also from Kitchen Devils I think). This baby finally gave me what I was looking for - bloody sharp knives (in every sense of bloody). The only down-side was that it didn&rsquo;t seem to sharpen all knives and after a while it stopped sharpening altogether (later I would discover that this is due to the build up of metal on the ceramic which can be cleaned off):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/42384240/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/32/42384240_8fd69c06f7_o.jpg" alt="rollsharp_th" /></a></p>

<p>So things were on the up-and-up but of course I was never satisfied. Then a few years back I was in the Ballymaloe shop and  found this beauty:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bandon1/42266745/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/30/42266745_d9d012fe9e_m.jpg" alt="IMG_1447" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for three or four years now. The big advantage it has is the presence of two grades of ceramic. The rough one to create a basic edge on something very blunt and a finer one to hone a knife that has just lost sharpness. It&rsquo;s always worked well but suffered the same metal build-up and it was nigh on impossible to scrub off the metal due to its shape. But there were two bigger problems - firstly it was getting more and more difficult to keep an edge on knives even for a day or two and secondly it seemed to be creating very rough pitted edges on the knives.</p>

<p>Recently I decided to do a bit of further reading and discovered this excellent foodie web-site:</p>

<p><a href="http://forums.egullet.com/">eG Forums (The eGullet Society for Culinary Arts and Letters)</a>.</p>

<p>They have a<a href="http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=108&amp;t=26036&amp;"> fantastic guide to knife sharpening</a> and cover all the issues involved. The ideal for them is a sharpening-stone but that requires too much skill for my liking. The best alternatives are the angled ceramic sharpeners. The rotating disk ones that I had used are like crude mini-versions of these but damage the blade too much.</p>

<p>One that seemed to get good recommendations was the <a href="http://spyderco.com/catalog/details.php?product=77">Spyderco Sharpmaker 204</a>. I took a browse over to <a href="http://www.newgraham.com/sharpmaker.htm">New Graham Knives</a> in the US who were also recommended. They were selling it for $46.81 including instructional DVD. How could I pass up a bargain like that? A quick check to see that they would ship to Ireland and I put in my order. They shipped the following day and I got it in less than a week. Well impressed!</p>

<p>I did grin when I opened the package as out fell a box of plasters with the byline &ldquo;because you&rsquo;ll need them&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I did the first few knives without watching the DVD and was happy with the results but not blown away. Then I watched the DVD and saw where I was making a few mistakes. I took my favourite chef&rsquo;s knife (actually a cheap all-metal one from Marks and Sparks) and ran it through the four-stage 160 stroke process. I pressed the edge of it with my thumb and goddammed cut myself! I could not believe it. I&rsquo;ve only ever cut myself by running a knife along flesh.This thing is now literally razor-sharp. When done right, the resulting knife will cut paper without any pressure.</p>

<p>So after a long, emotional and spiritual journey of over thirty years, I have now reached nirvana and will be happily slicing soft tomatoes with my lethal weapons until my hands no longer work.</p>

<p>Finally, some pictures of my pride and joy:</p>
