I have to apologise to [Damien](http://mulley.net/) for not blogging this until now. He has put together one of those simple, beautifully executed ideas called [Gastronom.ie](http://gastronom.ie/). It collects all of the food writing from a set of Irish bloggers into one place. So if you are sick of bouncing around from blog to blog to blog and you really aren't into this whole geeky RSS idea, then you'll become addicted to this site.

It looks lovely and the development was done by the brilliant [John Blackbourn](http://johnblackbourn.com/) who I would recommend to anyone who needs web development or design done. He has LouderVoice as very happy customers too.

Some of us are having a wee non-serious argument about wordplay on ie domains. Some think that only geeks get them and that a mainstream audience will always pronounce the dot. How would you say the following?

*   [Beaut.ie](http://beaut.ie/)
*   [Pix.ie](http://pix.ie/)
*   [Gastronom.ie](http://gastronom.ie/)

I'll be honest, I never spotted the first wordplay but I did see it in the second two. You?

In any case, get yourself over to [Gastronom.ie](http://gastronom.ie/) and check out some top class food writing.
