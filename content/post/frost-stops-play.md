Whilst growing up from age 6-18 in Kilkenny, one group of people I never got on with were the park-keepers ("parkies") in the Castle Park. They always seemed to be fun-killers.

It looks like nothing has changed in over 20 years. I watched at least 50 people walk away gutted from the park yesterday with bawling children due to this:

One person claimed it was because a child had slipped and hurt themselves on the previous day. A child. Hurt. In a playground. Shock! Horror! How could this happen? Quick! Sue someone! 

We just went and climbed some 100 ft tall trees and let the children fall into the unfenced pond instead since that was much safer.

And don't get me started on the "We close at 4pm but actually lock all but one of the gates at 3.30pm so we can be in the pub at 4.01pm".

Office of Public _Works_ eh?
