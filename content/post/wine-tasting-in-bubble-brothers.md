Like blogs? Like wine? Then Julian over at Bubble Brothers is having a wee tasting this coming Thursday. All details [over on the blog](http://bubblebrothers.com/blog/?p=576).
> This coming Thursday, 25th September, Emilio Saez van Eerd of Casa de las Vides and Javier Navarro from Tintoralba (earlier tasting summarized in this post) will be making a flying visit to us, and I’d like to give them and their wines as much publicity as possible.  Check out the EWBC stuff on Vinus TV.

> The day’s events have not yet been decided - but I think it would be great if as many blog and twit and wine folk as possible could come along to a leetle tasting here at the Marina on Thursday 25th.  I’ve already had encouraging responses from a number of people, both on the wine side and in techno-trousers.
