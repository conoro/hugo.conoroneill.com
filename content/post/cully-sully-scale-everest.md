Well not quite but they did get to Nepal. In Sully's own words

> If you would like to see Cully & Sully in action (and have a good laugh) tune into RTE 1 at 22.45 tonight.

> There will be a half hour programme about our recent trip roughing it in Nepal whilst attempting to assist a women’s cooperative – you’ll get a flavour of my truly amazing negotiation skills and Cul’s cooking under pressure!!!!!

If you are not familiar with their soups and ready meals, check them out the next time you don't feel like cooking. We are fans.
