Anthony and the gang in [Ummera](http://www.ummera.com/) are hosting a Slow Food Event on the 28th. All the details over [at their blog](http://www.ummera.com/wordpress/?p=80). In a nutshell:

> There will be a number of small artisan producers displaying, tasting and selling their products. There will also be several organisations and companies who are involved in matters of a sustainable nature, solar panels, wetland construction, vermicomposting, permaculture, wind and hydro power.

Well worth a trip down to a beautiful location and a fabulous building.
