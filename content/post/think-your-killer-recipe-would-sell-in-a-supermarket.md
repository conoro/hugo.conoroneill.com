Aisling from RTE in Cork contacted a bunch of Irish bloggers about a new show they are doing. I'm thrilled she did, considering it's exactly what I recommended only a few weeks ago in the context of my "Heat" review.

The idea is simple, it's a 6 part competition show called Recipe for Success that will see 15 home cooks battle it out to have their own gastronomic creations stocked on the shelves of SuperValu. Viewers of the series will see the whole development process of the product.

I honestly think this is the smartest idea for a food programme that RTE has had since they spotted the potential of Darina Allen all those years ago. I can't wait to see how you take a home-cooked meal and turn it into a shelf-ready product.

If you have a dish you know people love and which has the potential to be packaged, why not give this a go? SuperValu already stocks the wonderful Cully and Sully range so the precedent for high-end ready-meals is there.

The question is, would my Sophie Grigson derived (but still unique) [meatballs](http://conoroneill.com/2005/09/19/meatballs-in-tomato-sauce/) make the cut or would potential customers just lump it into the same category as the dreaded B***s E*e Spag Bol in a bag (which I ate many times in college)? Sadly my [Chicken Tikka](http://conoroneill.com/2006/10/13/conors-ultra-secret-chicken-tikka-masala-recipe/), whilst amazing, is just a straight lift from a book.

All details are [on the RTE site](http://www.rte.ie/tv/recipeforsuccess/). G'wan, you know you want to.
