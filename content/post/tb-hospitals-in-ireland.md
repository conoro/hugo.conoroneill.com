I made a quick mention of the old TB hospitals [in a blog post](http://conoroneill.com/2007/03/28/five-children-have-tb-in-that-creche/) about BCG almost two years ago. As far as I know there were lots of them. Peamount, which we drove past many times, opened in 1912 and there was also Cappagh and others.

I just got a lovely email from someone who was in such a hospital in the 1950s wondering if I'd got any feedback. Unfortunately I hadn't. So I thought I'd just pop this up with the aim to allow anyone to give their thoughts, reminiscences etc of these places. Good and bad. Feel free to pass on to anyone you know who had TB back then. Of course commenters can remain anonymous/pseudonymous.
