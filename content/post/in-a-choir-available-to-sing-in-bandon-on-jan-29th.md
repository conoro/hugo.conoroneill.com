I've just been contacted by a someone organising a lovely local event. They are looking for a folk choir or an upbeat church choir to get involved.

It's on 29th Jan 2010 in Bandon.

They also need an audio system if you know of anyone willing to loan for the night.

Mail me on conor@loudervoice.com if you want to help out and I'll pass on your details.
