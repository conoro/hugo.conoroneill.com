<div style="clear:both;"></div>From the Onion: [Irish-Heritage Timeline](http://theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4111&n=12)

Sample: "1487 - In a decision still regretted today, Irish let a few British friends stay in Belfast".

This must have been written by a Paddy. Makes me proud to be Irish. 

Unfortunately, as I spent 8 years in the Scouts as a kid and had to march in the pissing rain every March 17th in the Paddy's Day Parade in Kilkenny, I now have a pathological loathing of the whole day. Saluting a buch of no-name County Councillors who were happily sitting in the dry in an open-sided Smithwicks truck trailer has made me a bitter man. Snakes, schmakes.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
