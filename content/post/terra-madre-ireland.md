Dianne Curtin just let me know about [Terra Madre Ireland](http://terramadreireland.com) which is on in WIT, Waterford from 4th - 7th September. Anyone involved in the Slow Food movement will know what this is about. If you don't:
> **A Sustainable Future for the Irish Food Industry**
> 
> An important conference for all those involved in the Irish food chain including state bodies, retailers, growers and food producers. Attend the morning conference and choose 1 of 40 workshops (click for list) to contribute to key policy debates. A Policy Statement from each Workshop will be produced with key recommendations presented in the afternoon feedback session to Ministers for Agriculture (North and South). President Mary McAleese will address delegates on Friday afternoon.
Sounds like it may be a very special weekend.
