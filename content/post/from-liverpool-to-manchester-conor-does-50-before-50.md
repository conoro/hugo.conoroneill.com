Last March I decided I wanted to run a 50 mile race before I hit the big five oh in May of this year. On Monday, in spite of freezing rain, hail, sleet and snow, I somehow managed it and I can't stop randomly grinning.

As always, have no fear, this won't be a mile-by-mile race report. I'd fall asleep writing it :-) Speaking of which, one of my ultra-running top tips is "Don't listen to the audiobook of 'Why We Sleep' on miles 30-40 of a 50 miler if you want to avoid getting verrrrry verrrry sleepy." (The same also applies to the audio book of Niall Ferguson's 'The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook').

I know 50 miles is way outside of the experience of most people. But trust me when I say that anyone of you reading this could have done it. A solid level of fitness, a bit of stubborness and experience of lots of time on your feet is really all you need. Remember I'm 60lbs overweight and I finished. I'll mention the weight thing again shortly.

## Training
Training for L2M50 was a disaster. I ignored every bit of advice in books and immediately went from 22ish miles per week to 37 miles per week in January. Very quickly both achilles were in pain and both knees were complaining. Despite trying everything, the right achilles was still hurting all the way up to race day. I'd end up dong a long run on a Sunday and then taking days off for the achilles to calm down. My tapering consisted of not running at all for the last two weeks, hoping to give it a rest. Stoopid.

My wife had a better time with training and was far more diligent. She spotted MCI back-to-back marathons in Limerick in March which would have been an ideal check of how we'd handle 50 miles. In the end it was cancelled with the snow. Instead we did the EOI Lusk Marathon followed by the MCI Salthill one. All the signs were good (apart from that Salomon Sense Pro Max disaster in Salthill).

## Mental Training
Look, my marathon times are a disaster. I'm slowly getting faster but I'm still crazy slow. However that turns out to be a big help when getting your head sorted for a 50 miler. I'm used to spending many (many many) hours on my feet moving slowly and never DNFing marathons.

It's possibly a placebo, but I get great value from Headspace. There have been many marathons where I've channeled Andy's calm dulcet tones and got myself out of serious negativity.

The other huge help on Monday was actually The Barkley Marathons on the previous weekend. Seeing and reading about the hell everyone went through this year gave me a sense of perspective "It's only a flat 50 miles Conor. And your collar-bone isn't broken like Eoin Keith's was."

## Liverpool
How the hell have I got to 49 years old and never visited Liverpool before? The regenerated docks area is fabulous and everyone was just lovely. The hotel and start line were at Albert Dock and we registered just beside them on Sunday night in the cold.
