I know the whole [Twitter](http://twitter.com) thing is still completely alien to a lot of people. How many wondered what the hell the papers were on about when discussing Dan Boyle's "[tweet](http://twitter.com/sendboyle/status/9245275419)"?

Here's a suggestion for dipping your toe in and getting a handle on it all. [Karwig Wines](http://www.karwigwines.ie) in Carrigaline is running the third "Twebt" which is a Twitter wine-tasting competition ([Bubble Brothers](http://www.bubblebrothers.com/) and [Curious Wines](http://www.curiouswines.ie/) ran the first two).

The idea is very simple. You get a bottle of wine from Joe and his gang in Karwig's and it is wrapped up so you can't see the label. At an agreed time, 9pm Sunday March 7th, people open the wine and start tasting it and putting their tasting notes up on Twitter.Then they start guessing the country, grape etc and maybe even the exact wine.

It's a bit of fun and those taking part range from gurus to tipplers and everyone in between.

Full details on taking part are on [Brian Clayton's Blog](http://brianclayton.ie/twebt/) and on the [Karwig's Blog](http://www.karwigwines.ie/pc/Twebt-Mystery-Bottle-2p394.htm). If you just want to watch what happens then you can see all the tweets in the run-up and on the night over at [http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23twebt](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23twebt).
