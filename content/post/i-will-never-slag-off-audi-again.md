[Jalopnik ](http://www.jalopnik.com/)is one of the two best sites on the web for petrol heads (the other being [Autoblog](http://www.autoblog.com/)).

Earlier this week [they had a link to a wonderful video](http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/retro-racing/senna-hotlaps-an-nsx-around-suzuka-161113.php) of Ayrton Senna taking a Honda NSX for a blast around a race track. Just watch his right foot blipping the throttle. Is that what you call toe-tip control? The world really is a more boring place with him gone.

But Jalopnik [went one better yesterday](http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/news/holy-crap-man-survives-crash-with-truck-bus-in-audi-161451.php). They link over to a story and actual footage of an Audi TT being flattened by an out-of-control articulated lorry. Somehow (and no-one really knows how), the driver escaped with scratches and bruises. You have to check this out.
