[Arrested Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development) has a lawyer whose ad states, "you don't need double talk, you need Bob Loblaw". 

C'mon, best play on words ever. 

Then tonight they nearly go one better as he announces that he has to go home to write "The Bob Loblaw Law Blog"

Yeah, I'm tired, but I'm still giggling.

Ye wanna know why YouTube is worth $1.6B? Cos I've just discovered [that they have the clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TewF6FX_8k)!
