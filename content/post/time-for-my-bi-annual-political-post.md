At this stage I'm sick to the back teeth of the moral relativism that passes for liberal thought in modern Europe and particularly in Ireland. Recent events in the Middle East have just amplified the noise. So it is a joy to read something as reasoned and balanced as [Norm Geras' post on what is happening in Lebanon](http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2006/07/the_rights_and_.html). Read the questions at the end very carefully and maybe you'll learn something about yourself from your answers. 

I'm surprised that so many of the old left in Britain have been able to move to a place politically where I can agree with much of what they say. It is a pity that the Irish left can still be found associating themselves with Ba'athist-hugging scumbags like George Galloway or Pol Pot groupies like Noam Chomsky.
