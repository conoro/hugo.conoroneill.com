Having a look at the [Flock ](http://www.flock.com/)browser to see if it is much cop. So far not bowled away at all. This is a test post from its blogging feature. The whole integration thing just isn't as slick as I was expecting.

More importantly, I have setup the "[Subscribe-to-Comments](http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/)" plug-in. So now if you add a comment, you can get notified by e-mail if someone else replies. It saves you having to constantly re-check. This is the only one of three plug-ins I tested last night which actually worked. That [Wordpress-Feedburner](http://orderedlist.com/articles/wordpress-feedburner-plugin/) one in particular just did not want to play ball.

I'm also testing the "[Connections Reloaded](http://www.ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/wpthemes/connections-reloaded/)" theme which is a big revamp of the one I'm using here ([Connections](http://vanillamist.com/blog/?page_id=81)). Looks better, has more features and is a lot better under the hood so I may try switching over tonight.

All for now. Gonna be a looooong day.

UPDATE: I don't like all the HTML crud it inserts all over my bog standard text. I don't hink I'll be using it to blog from now on.
