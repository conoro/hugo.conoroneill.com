<div style="clear:both;"></div>

Arrived 8am. Gel applied 10,30\. Some contractions. Tired. Wife fine. Doc figures we'll be done by afternoon. Gut says quite soon. Tens discarded. Sudoku being raced through. Finished national geographic. Starting 'car'. Snip being ordered as i type. This was the easy bit. Next few hours will not be fun for cath.
