John Prendergast from [Aonach](http://aonach.com/) just let me know about [a competition](http://glengarriff-lodge.com/news/competition/) a friend of his is running. It's pretty damned impressive: Glengarriff Lodge near Bantry in West Cork is giving away a [
Luxury Self Catering ](http://www.glengarriff-lodge.com) weekend worth â‚¬1175 to one lucky blogger who mentions it! The location looks gorgeous and the Lodge is interesting because the aim was to be both luxurious and eco-friendly/sustainable.

The concept might be of interest to Irish Bloggers who have a deep interest in sustainability like [Tom Atkins](http://minktoast.net/) or [Rebecca Hillman](http://irishcraftworker.typepad.com/).
