<div style="clear:both;"></div>I keep a "link-blog" over at [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/blog/bandon1). It is just a set of links to other peoples blog postings and sites with stories that caught my eye. I'll put a permanent link to it on this blog when I get a chance.

Overall I'm happy with Bloglines but I'm tired of old posts constantly re-appearing as new. Is Feedburner any better in this regard I wonder?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
