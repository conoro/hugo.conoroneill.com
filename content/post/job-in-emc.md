<div style="clear:both;"></div>A bit late with my good news but I've taken up a position as a Software Development Manager in EMC in Ovens down in the People's Republic of Cork. Started on June 11th. It has been a roller-coaster ride so far but it's a great place to work. Now to find a house and get Catherine, Fetus and two children down here.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
