<div style="clear:both;"></div>Had our scan today. Wee blobby is right on the predicted size for 9 weeks, 3 days. We expected Sib√©al to be rivetted by the  ultrasound but in fact she found the roller blind in the doctor's office to be more interesting. All looks good. Not twins. Sigh of relief. Catherine has the finger rash so is pretty sure what it is going to be.  Next scan probably in 8 weeks. Now for a nickname.
