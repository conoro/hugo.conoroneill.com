I think the name is superb and cuts through all the bullshit to get right to the heart of the matter. The time for politician's weasel words and acceptance of the criminal incompetence of the HSE and Dept of Health has to end. I hope this effort by Sabrina and others plays a big role in that. Please sign-up on the site and support them.
