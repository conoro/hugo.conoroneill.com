My two favourite products working together to make me run like the wind (*cough*).

When I switched from running in Bikilas to these TrekSports, I started getting a sore spot just behind the ball of my left foot. It appears to be due to a seam on the VFFs rubbing me. Using a temporary pad worked during the week so now I'm hoping this [Sugru](http://www.sugru.com) fix will be permanent. I have to run 5 miles tonight so that should prove it one way or another.
