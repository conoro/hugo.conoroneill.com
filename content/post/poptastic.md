<div style="clear: both" />Bloody vending machine in work is only taking exact change so I could only get a Smarties bar. But this is no ordinary Smarties bar - it's an "exploding one"!Massive flashbacks going on here. What the hell was the name of that sweet crystalline stuff in a bag that you shook on to your tongue in the 1970's and it exploded all over it? it's the same stuff. Hurrah, I've got a disco on my tongue. I thought they had banned it cos it contained plutonium or some other such "bad for children" thing.

But then this is Nestle, so it probably does contain plutonium.

Clackers anyone?
