It appears the opposition parties have started their campaign to lose the next general election with their latest himbo/bimbo scheme which they picked up from the UK. They want traffic lights on food to indicate the levels of salt, sugar and fat. Not only are the stuck in the 1980's with the fat obsession, but they show such a basic mis-understanding of human nature that the scheme was obviously devised by a marxist.

If I want to buy fat-laden, carb-laden, salt-laden Tayto, I bloody will and they chances of me looking at some insulting graphics are zero. When I smoked, you could have put pictures of sliced open cancerous lungs on the box and I'd happily have puffed away.

Information is only useful to those seeking it. If we want nutrition information then we'll use the amazing human ability to read to find out what is in the box. "oh but people don't know what a safe level of salt is, so our traffic light system will enable them to figure this out without actually ever having to think". "Next year, we'll be bringing in a system which does an instant analysis of your blood and won't let you buy anything with too much salt or sugar".

I was pleasantly surprised that FF told the opposition to get a clue and that they would not be bringing in such a scheme.

The first political party which starts a campaign to destroy the ever growing nanny state gets my vote.

You want people to eat properly? Then make <strike>Home Economics</strike>, <strike>Social and Scientific</strike>, **Cooking** compulsory in schools for both boys and girls starting around age 7\. Hell, you could do a double whammy and teach it through Irish.
