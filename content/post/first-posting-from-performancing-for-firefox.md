            I installed the Performancing extension for Firefox yesterday. It is a blogging add-on and I'm writing this post in it. Looks pretty good except I don't see any handling of Wordpress categories. If this feature does not exist or is not coming soon, I won't continue to use it. From a basic UI perspective it seems fine tho. And it'll handle multiple blogs. More as I investigate. Aha, found the categories tab, excellent. 

As I was sick from Sunday to pretty much yesterday, blogging has been close to zero. Upcoming topics which may interest you include:

[1] Conor's review of Ummera Smoked Eel (really good, try it)
[2] Mr Krabbs goes to Bandon (the story of a spider crab not a venereal disease)
[3] Skibbereen Winter Wonderland (who cares if a 37 year old wasn't that impressed, the kids loved it)
[4] Foodie Podcasts (the good, the bad, the deeply clueless)
[5] Logitech Quickcam Fusion Review (not just for for internet pRoN)
[6] I'm a lumberjack and I'm ok (bye bye goddammed poplars)
[7] My horrendous drinking problem (Oh god, I don't think I like booze any more)
[8] 2005 in review (or how many follicles died this year)
