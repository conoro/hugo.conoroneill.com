Congratulations to Myer's Maxol Garage in Mitchelstown. Without doubt the most disgusting, undrinkable excuse for a cup of coffee we have ever bought. I have to wonder if they are using mud in the machine rather than coffeee beans. I've had some pretty dire coffee over the years. What some Greek cafes did to Nescafe when I was there in 1988 should be banned under the Geneva Convention but they were better than the thing we had yesterday.

As for the toilets - I think the Monkey's from Madagascar got there first expecting a Tom Wolfe reading. For those of you who haven't seen Madagascar, think Trainspotting instead......
