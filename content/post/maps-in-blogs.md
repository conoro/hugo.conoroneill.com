If you want to try out the world of blogging, I highly recommend the new free&nbsp;[Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!174.entry) tool for creating your content. It works with almost any blogging site. Check out [Wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com/) to get an actual blog (also free). One of the main developers is from Cork you know!

Just to show one of the neat things that Live Writer can do, I was able to insert this map of Bandon with a few simple clicks.
