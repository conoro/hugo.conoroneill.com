I know the tech stuff annoys the foodie readers here and vice versa. So last week I started up a new Posterous blog over on [conoroneill.net](http://conoroneill.net/). It is much more high volume than this blog and consists mainly of pointers to interesting tech stuff, opinions thereof and the odd funny bit. So basically pretty much anything except food/Bandon, which will remain here.

I'll do the odd cross-reference when it makes sense. And hopefully the volume here will improve over the Spring as I get into a gardening groove. next post up is one on Jimmy Doherty's "From Crop to Shop" which may be one of the most educational programmes about food broadcast in the past ten years.
