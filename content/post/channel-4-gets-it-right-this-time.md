<div style="clear:both;"></div>"The Simpsons" is voted the best kids programme of all time.

And someone just said that it's the best TV show of all time. Ye know, they might be right.

Nice to see "The Muppet Show" and "Danger Mouse" do so well.

But "Bagpuss"? Never liked that show. Nothing ever bloody happened.

And a huge relief that they had "The Tomorrow People". For years I thought I had dreamt that show!

Ah, nostalgia.

Anyone got a MIDI of the theme music to "Play Away"? Might make a good ring tone. As a small child, I thought Brian Cant was god.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
