*   Tried to brush 7-year-old's hair. "noooo, I let my pillow decide my hairstyle". Smartass. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/11962781)
*   @TomRaftery - 1 x bouncy castle. 1000 x sweets, crisps and crap usually does the trick for our gang. Or Chuckies! [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/11969821)
