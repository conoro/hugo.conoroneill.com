Oscar the little sod broke the hinge on his DS again. Definitely a design flaw. The guy who provided the last replacement case no longer ships out of the US. 

Luckily some [knock-off merchants on e-bay](http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=8283687910) are selling clone cases in a variety of colours. Got a replacement funky dark grey one for him for Â£8.88 incl postage from Hong Kong. Not only is their Englsih a joy to read, check out their spelling on Nintendo. Up there with Sonny, JUV and Panasunic! I'm not complaining, it worked like a charm and he'll be a very happy new 7-year old when he gets up in the morning.
