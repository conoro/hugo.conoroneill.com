An old old friend (bet ya like that description Jane) is living over in Frankfurt. Her hubby has just finished McCarthy's Bar and is dying to visit the place mentioned in the book which he describes as an ex-church or nunnery in a small town near Cork, on the coast, known for it's good cuisine.

I have no idea where he is talking about and Googling only brings up the actual McCarthy's Bar in Castletownbere. Can the combined wisdom of the blogosphere help a Greek abroad? Just post your responses as a comment. Thanks.
