I can't bear to read the report. It sickens me to think what those evil scum covered up over the years.

I'm not a religious person but I take some comfort in imagining everyone involved in the systematic abuse of children in the 20th century burning in the eternal fires of hell.

Some comfort in imagining every priest, every brother, every nun, every bishop, every arch-bishop, every cardinal, every papal nuncio, every pope who knew anything about what was happening in this country and DID NOTHING, being raped by satan every day for eternity.

The [Catholic Church in Ireland](http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/) should have all of their lands seized immediately, held by NAMA and sold off when the economy recovers. That money should be ring-fenced to build the best system in the world to take care of children in need in Ireland.
