Rebecca (of the superb [Irish Craftworker's Good Life Blog](http://www.irishcraftworker.typepad.com/)) and her husband Dan have launched a new blog today dedicated to sustainable living. Well worth checking out over at the [Irish Sally Garden Blog](http://www.sallygardens.typepad.com/). I'm subscribed.

UPDATE: [Official Launch Post](http://sallygardens.typepad.com/sallygardens/2007/03/going_live.html) now up.
