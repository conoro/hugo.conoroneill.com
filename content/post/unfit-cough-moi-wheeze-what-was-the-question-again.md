The war on weight continues and I am debating whether to start a weekly post on the Bloggers Belly Bulkometer. Half a stone in a week is not bad going. Those couple of bottles of wine and cans of Becks each week were obviously contributing _slightly _to the inexorable move towards Rick Waller territory.

Tonight will be a major trial. Curry with brown rice, no naans and no booze in the house on my own. And they dare complain in New Orleans about how tough it is over there.

Next week I might try a bit of exercise, but it is far more fun instead just to read the [Unfit Comic Strip](http://www.comics.com/comics/unfit/index.html) which just gets better and better.

Wednesday's was one of the best yet:
