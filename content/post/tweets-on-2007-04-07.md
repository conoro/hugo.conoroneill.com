*   Wow, 6 of us in room and they all slept despite their daddy's snoring. Up 7.20\. Sooo glad weather is good so they can play outside [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/21359011)
*   Spam gone mental in the past week and Akismet letting quite a bit through. Added Spam Karma 2 and Bad Behaviour to blogs to assist [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/21359321)
*   Why does Bad Behaviour cause 400 Error on conoroneill.com but not on argolon.com or blog.loudervoice.com? No joy on google [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/21359451)
*   FON up and running between Rosslare and Tagoat. Only â‚¬3 per day. All proceeds go to the conoroneill benevolent fund. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/21416751)
*   Both CBS in US and BBC in UK refuse to stream Amen Corner live to Irish IPs for my Da. The joy of web-proxy sites! [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/21504571)
*   Nephew just pointed out that web proxies are how they get around all the lockdowns on their machines in school! [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/21504951)
*   Bandon to Rosslare. One cop at Carrigtwohill at the site of that lethal piece of arrow straight dual carriageway where no-one has ever died. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/21635821)
*   22 year old french wine. Strange crust on cork. Not great but drinkable. Oldest wine I've ever quaffed. Thanks Dad. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/21726371)
