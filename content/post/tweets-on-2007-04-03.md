*   Just realised how weak Thunderbird address book is. Imported CSV into an address book but no way to bulk add all to a mail-list. What can? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/18358621)

*   Ended up doing CSV-&gt;LDIF in TB on XP. Then LDIF-&gt;Evolution on Fedora and then drag-drop to mailing list in Evolution. All to BCC a few [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/18415281)
*   didn't think of CRM. Good idea! [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/18425551)
