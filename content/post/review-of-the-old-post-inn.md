### Considered by many to be one of the best restaurants in Ulster. Correctly.

We threw a surprise 60th birthday party for my mother-in-law in The Old Post last weekend. We had eaten there several years ago when it was good but not awesome. All reports recently have said that it is now in the awesome category.

We had a private function room with over twenty people and they did a great job all night on service and getting everyone's food out at the same time.

The fixed four-course menu had tons of seasonal ingredients and lots that I would happily eat. The waitress came to take my order and I couldn't remember the exact name of my starter so I said "the little bird to start" "then the sorbet". She wondered if I'd be "going with bambi for the main course". Ye know, she was right.

The food was wonderful and avoided those tarry intense sauces that are often served with game and overwhelm it. Beautifully cooked, great flavours and top class meat.

The house wines were all excellent and the desserts were spot on.

Since it changed hands, it looks like they no longer have a web-site which is odd. They have a bunch of BandB rooms which we want to try out at some stage.

To get to it, exit off the Cavan bypass at Butlersbridge and follow the signs for the restaurant itself. If you are anywhere in the area, it is worth the detour.
