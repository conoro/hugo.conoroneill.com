Finally a book review on the blog. I'm not sure where I heard about this book, probably Twitter, but damn it's a great story. I'd never heard of John Lenihan until 3 weeks ago. Then I read this [Irish Times article](http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/tough-as-leather-john-lenihan-the-conqueror-of-carrauntoohil-1.2273089) and my jaw was on the floor. He has not only won the Carrauntoohil mountain race 19 times, he still holds the record of 1 hour 11 minutes and 43 seconds. Read that again. Up and down the highest mountain in Ireland in 1:11:43. Holy shit the man is a running machine.

His story is genuinely interesting and he comes across as a honourable talented hard-working man who will probably never get the adulation he deserves. The writing itself is very pedestrian but that's ok, the story is strong enough to carry it. A recommended read if you have any interest in running, striving or making hard choices. You can [buy it on Book Depository](http://www.bookdepository.com/Tough-Leather-John-Lenihan/9781782805045).
