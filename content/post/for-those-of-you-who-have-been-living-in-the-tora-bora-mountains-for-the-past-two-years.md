And have never heard of Langerland, get yerself over to [www.langerland.com](http://www.langerland.com) and watch their [latest cartoon](http://www.langerland.com/content/view/57/59/).

A snot-ejecting moment when Sean Óg's All-Ireland speech started with "Bhí mé ag dul go dtí an siopa chun rudaí a cheannach"
.
.
.
"Agus Cheannaigh mé **uachtar reoite**!!!!!"

These guys should be as famous as Atom Films. Keep it up.
