Trevor Collins is doing a phenomenal job over on the [Bandon.ie](http://www.bandon.ie/blogspot/blogger.html) blog with updates on the floods and plenty of guidance/links. If you live locally or travel through here, you need to be following it. If you are on Twitter, I auto-post links to all his posts over on [twitter.com/bandon](http://twitter.com/bandon).
