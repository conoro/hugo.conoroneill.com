When Haydn [asked the question recently](http://argolon.com/BarCampIreland/blog/2006/10/05/contact-numbers-for-all-the-speakers/#comment-94) on the BarCamp Ireland blog if anybody had&nbsp;any favourite Irish entertainment sites/blogs and I replied,&nbsp;little did I know that he was going to quote me more than once in The Irish Times. I thought it would be just&nbsp;part of a&nbsp;"Conor likes this", "Mick likes that" "Mary&nbsp;like these" list. Chuffed? Hell I grinned from Bandon to Dublin yesterday.

That has to be one of the&nbsp;best newspaper articles I have read in a long time. Not only was it almost entirely non-Dublin-centric, it talked about exciting things which are still outside the mainstream&nbsp;and&nbsp;reminded me&nbsp;how dull most mainstream media has become. My gut (big as it is) tells me that there is a major opportunity just bubbling under the surface here and I can't wait to see who grabs it and runs with it.&nbsp;

[Swearing Lady](http://arseendofireland.blogspot.com/) deserves a huge readership and I'm thrilled he gave her so much coverage. Haydn called her "arguably the most talented writer at work today in Ireland" and I completely agree. I may be an RSS&nbsp;addict with my 350 feeds but of all of them,&nbsp;her writing is&nbsp;something&nbsp;I actively look forward to every day.&nbsp;I'm sure HarperCollins will be banging down her door soon to add her to their pedigree stable as an understudy to Cecelia ;-)

Haydn himself has a few superb blogs with [Mediangler](http://www.mediangler.com/) (no not Media Langer) being the main one &nbsp;and I particularly love his new site that he runs with his wife called [My Diet Friends](http://www.mydietfriends.com/). This is a site about diet rather than dieting and &nbsp;if you have any interest in healthy eating and food, it is a must read.

Recently both CNET and Yahoo have launched food sites and I find myself bristling just thinking about them. In both cases I just feel like tech/media companies have spotted another valuable demographic with monetizable eyeballs rather than really giving a damn about food. They are not, [as Seth Godin would say](http://www.allmarketersareliars.com/), telling authentic stories. Have a look over at what PodChef Neal [is doing on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Podchef) to see how passion and knowledge count for far more than slick design.

I'll stick with [Podchef](http://podchef.motime.com/),&nbsp;[My Diet Friends](http://www.mydietfriends.com), [eGullet](http://www.egullet.org/), [Elise Bauer](http://www.elise.com/), [Bibliocook](http://www.bibliocook.com/) and the handful of other sites/blogs run by people who are genuinely passionate about food.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
