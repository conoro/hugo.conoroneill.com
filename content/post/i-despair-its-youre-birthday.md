We just had Ois√≠n's 4th birthday party. He had a whale of a time in KidzKlub in Bandon and two of his buddies from his old playschool turned up so he was over the moon. He did well on the present front and has just spent the past hour opening them and enthusing in the way that only he can do. Catherine was putting the cards up on the mantlepiece when she noticed something odd about one of them. Check it out:

I initially put it down to the card being made somewhere like China. Then I turned it over. It appears that English is not the first language for people in Roscommon either!
