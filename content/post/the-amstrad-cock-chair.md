They really missed a trick on The Apprentice tonight. What man wouldn't buy a chair shaped like a giant knob? Light Cubes for Â£85, me hole.

Syed is a god of sales: "these are the future of fuel cans" - said with a totally straight face. A full recovery after his disasterous car sales technique where I am sure they cut some of his patter with one couple : "This car is made of pure gold. It will be worth one billion pounds in three years time. If you buy it, I promise to give you my first born son, and my second born. Pleeeeeeease buy it."

But I still miss Jo.

Best line of the night came from Margaret when she described Sharon, Syed and Tuan as "The Whinger, the Liar and the Planner".

Whew, he finally fired the whingey griping gooseberry-sucking sour-pussed Scot.
