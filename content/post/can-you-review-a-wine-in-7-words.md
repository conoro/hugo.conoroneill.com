I know a lot of the readers here are foodies and I'm sure some of you may even like the odd glass of wine. We've decided to take part in a regular event called Wine Blogging Wednesday. Event #42 happens this coming Wednesday and the challenge is to review an Italian Red in 7 words. I love a challenge and this is a tough one.

You don't have to be a blogger to take part. The easiest way to do it is to send your review by SMS from your mobile phone to LouderVoice. We're going to collect them all and point the WBW guys to them.

The steps you need to follow are simple.

1.  Sign Up on [LouderVoice here](http://www.loudervoice.com/register/)
2.  [Login to LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/login) using the username and password you picked
3.  Tell us your mobile phone number here using format country area number, like this:

4.  Send us the wine review in this format to 087-9409325 (standard rate message)

    ** ****Review Rating-1-to-5 NameOfWine: Seven Words of description. #wbw42**

It should look like this:
