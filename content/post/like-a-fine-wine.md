In a change from our usual programming here at Bandon HQ, I kicked off a light-hearted conversation on Twitter earlier about great looking women who just get better and better with age (we also covered men). The results of the Twitter jury in chronological (not age) order were as follows:

*   Neve Campbell
*   My wife
*   Marisa Tomei
*   Maria Bello
*   Catherine Keener
*   Monica Bellucci
*   Helen Mirren
*   Isabella Rossellini
*   Candice Bergen
*   Mary McDonnell
*   Natalie Portman
*   Laura Linney
*   Joan Allen
*   Mary Louise Parker
*   Lauren Graham
*   Michelle Pfeiffer
*   Felicity Kendal
*   Glynis Barber
*   Sigourney Weaver
*   Susan Sarandon
*   Helena Bonham-Carter
*   Helen Baxendale
*   Jennifer Beals
And for the men we had:

*   George Clooney
*   Paul Newman
*   Richard Gere
*   Sean Connery
*   Pierce Brosnan
*   Harrison Ford
*   Liam Neeson
*   Steve McQueen (I snuck that one in there)
*   Hugh Laurie
*   Alan Rickman
*   John Hannah
*   Adrian Brody
Those are far more satisfying that the pneumatic nobodies that grace most (wo)mens magazines. Any we've missed?
