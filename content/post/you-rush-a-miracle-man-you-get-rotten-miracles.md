<div style="clear:both;"></div>Nostalgia time, 80's fans. Due to unprecedented public demand (currently at zero requests), I am making available my classic ZX Spectrum games at no cost. Each of these 4K masterpieces, which took months of pubescent angst to complete, requires either an actual ZX Spectrum or an emulator to play. My two favourite emulators are [EmuZWin](http://bonanzas.rinet.ru/apps/EmuZWin_Eng.htm) and [ZXSpin](http://www.zxspin.co.uk/). The current version of ZXSpin seems to have some problem finding ROMs so maybe stick with EmuZWin for the moment.

The three games are:

[The Grid](http://www.argolon.com/GRID.TAP).   [Screengrab here](http://www.argolon.com/the_grid.jpg). This is a TAP file (the preferred format) which is loaded as a tape.
[Cent The Pete](http://www.argolon.com/centis.z80).   [Screengrab here](http://www.argolon.com/centis.jpg). This is a Z80 file which is just a memory snapshot.
[The Cherry Run](http://www.argolon.com/cherrys.z80).   [Screengrab here](http://www.argolon.com/cherry_run.jpg). Ditto.

Download and be amazed what one teenage geek can create in hand-crafted Z80 assembler with no proper development tools on an original rubber keyed ZX Spectrum 48K. Or maybe just think - what a pile of crap.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
