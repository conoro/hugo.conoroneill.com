The stats around [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) in Ireland are staggering, they are racing towards 1 millions active users here. That just blows my mind. Some are predicting they'll have more pageviews globally than Google by next year!

Whilst I initially didn't have much time for it, coming from the open blogging world, bit by bit its value for me has grown. Even at the simplest level, it is the only site where many people I know from school and college ever congregate online.

In our business, [LouderVoice](http://business.loudervoice.com/), we have hooked ourselves into Facebook so that when people review products/services on our clients' web-sites, those reviews can be published to Facebook too. It's an amazingly powerful marketing tool. You can [see it in action here](http://business.loudervoice.com/widget-reviews/). That system can be placed on any web-site in as little as 10 minutes.

If you are on Facebook or you are thinking of joining, why not [become a fan of LouderVoice](http://www.facebook.com/pages/LouderVoice/7397405425) there? You'll see a sample of the best content from our site and customers posted there along with questions, ideas, polls and competitions.

If you are a small business, then you should really consider creating a Facebook Fan page. It only takes a few minutes and can be a great way of interacting with customers and fans. You only have to look at the success of [the Hairy Baby one](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hairy-Baby/20379962148) to see how well it can go!
