<div style="clear:both;"></div>Of the zillions of web-sites I access in an average week, only one is unusable with Firefox - the online banking one from the donkey's over at Ulster Bank. Has someone not told them that even MS now recommend the use of the Sun JVM?

[Get Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ "Get Firefox") and at the very least, learn to browse with tabs.

You'll love it.
