Four years ago I wrote [a quick throwaway post](http://conoroneill.com/2009/01/17/tb-hospitals-in-ireland/) about TB hospitals in Ireland. For whatever reason it bubbles up very close to the top of any google search on that topic. As a result, I have set of comments there which just have to be read. All of them are interesting, many are heartbreaking. The majority are written by people who were either in such a hospital or had a relation in one.

I implore someone to take this information and do a proper documentary on it before it's too late and all of these people are gone. These stories have been hidden for far too long, just like so many other parts of our 20th century history in Ireland.

Is anyone out there up to the task?
