*   Just watched the departed. Superb. Which Hong Kong movie was it based on? Infernal Affairs? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12255931)
*   @tomraftery - Hope babba is recovering well. Kids and hospitals always scary. Shout if you need anything. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12435711)
*   Hmm, none of my kids like "Happy Feet". First half an hour comes across as subtle as a sledgehammer. I also rate "tap" down near "mime". [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12436161)
*   Fair weather gardener. Set foot out there for the first time this year. Weeded the raised bed and replaced rotten wood on shed. Need a nap [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12547811)
*   Oh never got that nobile twitter app working on N70\. Complains about incorrect credentials. Pity. Looks good. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12548701)
*   I ruined a lovely chicken in white wine, olive and caper sauce by burning the f**ker cos I was pulling weeds. Speedy tomato n garlic instead [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12552301)
*   Drive Manchester to Nordschleife and then last 7 seconds on Nurburgring before crashing. Clip of the month! [http://tinyurl.com/328ssv](http://tinyurl.com/328ssv) [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12561111)
*   Oh dear, first episode of new series of Jonathan Ross rubbish. Harry Potter, Thandie Neton and some boxer. Yawn. FFed through it all. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12591891)
*   Elbow paralysed after weeding. So much for Udo's oil cure. Voltarol and Sauvignon Blanc seems to be helping. Another great "House". Bed [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12670031)
