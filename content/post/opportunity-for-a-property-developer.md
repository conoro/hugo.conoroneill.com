Now that's a phrase you didn't expect to hear in the current economic climate.

One of the reasons we settled on Bandon when we moved to Cork was the classic location, location, location. It really is ideally situated in Munster for access to almost everything - Cork City, Airport, beaches, businesses, school, sports facilities etc etc.

However, this prime location is missing something critical - somewhere people can meet in a modern business context. Whether it's for seminars, conferences, training or bigger community events, we have nothing. There are many organisations (state, semi-state and private enterprise), who would kill for a venue where people from all corners of Munster, Ireland and Europe could meet and get to easily.

The beneficial knock-on effects to other local businesses of having a regular stream of visitors are obvious. At the moment, all that business traffic goes to the city, Clon, Skibb, Kinsale and elsewhere.

So there you have it. If you are someone who has spent a fortune on property in the area over the last ten years and/or if you are sitting on assets you won't be able to shift until 2010 at the earliest, here's a way to generate immediate regular cash and provide a major boost to the town.
