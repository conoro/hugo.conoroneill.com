<div style="clear:both;"></div>I'll just have to give up the drink next week.

[Hugh McLeod of Gaping Void](http://www.gapingvoid.com/) fame has arranged for [Irish bloggers to get their hands on free bottles of Stormhoek](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001646.html) too. 

Hope they give me some Sauvignon Blanc. New Zealand Marlborough Sauvignon is pretty much all we drink but we have got some good bottles of South African Sauvignon recently which are far far better than anything coming out of Chile.
