Last time in Texas I was in a compact car. I was nearly crushed to death several times each day. This time, it was going to be fire with fire.

You lookin' at me? I said are you lookin at me?

UPDATE: Goddammit, Baz was right. It is a poxing mini-van not an SUV (the sliding door is what gives it away). The locals were gentle with me and said it was kinda a minivan-SUV hybrid until one of em goes, "yeah, for soccer moms". The shame, the shame. I may as well be driving a prius.
