I was thrilled to get an email from Tara O'Donoghue to tell me that Bandon allotments are up and running.

The allotment garden is located in Cloughmacsimon – a short distance off the bypass, right behind Coláiste Na Toirbhirte. 

Plots are available in 2 sizes 5x7m for €80pa or 5x10m for €100pa. There are plenty of plots available so call 023 8852922 or 087 9567452 or email bandontransition@gmail.com for more information. 

**Bandon Community Allotments Open Day Sunday 16th May 1.30 pm**

Plenty of family entertainment on the day with music, face painting, fun games and competitions like Wellie Throwing, Wheelbarrow Races, Tug O War, Make your own Scarecrow, prizes and more.

All the details over on [www.bandoncommunityallotments.com](http://www.bandoncommunityallotments.com).

They are also at [Transition Bandon](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Transition-Bandon/327206350071?ref=ts&v=wall) on Facebook.

Well done to everyone involved in this!
