<div style="clear:both;"></div>Saw a funny cartoon in The New Yorker (courtesy of sis Fiona) yesterday about guy sitting in traffic, blogging his utterly banal whinges in real-time. Today, I read that Google have launched [Blogging from your Mobile Phone](http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=1131). US only for now but hopefully I'll be able to blog my musing from the lav some day soon.
