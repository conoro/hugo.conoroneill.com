<div style="clear:both;"></div>My Alma Mater, University College Dublin, is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year and there is a special event being held on April 12th to recognise achievements of past graduates of the Engineering School, and to look forward to the future.

One of the items intended for the day is a brief archive of past graduates and what they have got up to. So if you are willing to supply some career details/highlights/images etc, please e-mail [Conor Heneghan](mailto:conor dot heneghan at ucd dot ie) or [David Timoney](mailto:david dot timoney at ucd dot ie) for a form which you can fill out. Please spread freely to other graduates of UCD Engineering and Architecture.
