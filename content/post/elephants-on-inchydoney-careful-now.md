Just in from my sis. Some [very cool Elephants](http://macra.infopop.cc/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/764608735/m/3101041382) on Inchydoney beach in Clon for the next few days.

It's actually a project involving Clonakilty Macra and other local community groups to to highlight the plight of the Asian Elephant. I'll be taking a trip down for sure.
