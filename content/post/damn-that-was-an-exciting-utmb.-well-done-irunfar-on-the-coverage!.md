As always, amazing coverage from the [iRunFar](https://www.irunfar.com/) crew who deserve all your [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/iRunFar) support. I was thrilled to get some of their stickers in the post this week. I also wear my iRunFar t-shirt as often as possible.

I'm hoping to spend time near Chamonix next year to finally check out those amazing trails. I've been downloading lots of GPX traces from people I follow on Strava who have been there over the past few months. And of course I have the Cicerone book.
