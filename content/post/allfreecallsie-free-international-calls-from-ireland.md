Some of you may have heard about [AllFreeCalls](http://allfreecalls.net/) which allows people in the US to call internationally for the price of a call to Iowa (often free). This is a service run by a great guy called Pat Phelan in Cork.

Well they've just gone and [extended it to Ireland](http://www.allfreecalls.ie/). If you have one of those free national calls packages that most of the telcos like Eircom and BT here provide, then you can call international numbers for zero cost using AllFreeCalls. Yup, big fat zero. Even if you don't have such a package, you'll just pay the price of a local or national call to ring many countries around the world. Very simple instructions on how to do it over at [AllFreeCalls.ie](http://www.allfreecalls.ie/)

For once it's great to report on Non-Ripoff-Ireland.
