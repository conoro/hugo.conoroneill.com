Get yer dancing shoes on because they really do have a line-up to suit everyone this year.

> As with previous years the Bandon Music Festival will consist of two free outdoor concerts on Saturday and Sunday.  In addition, the Music Trail will take place each night of the festival in local pubs.  These sessions will consist of trad, folk and rock.  Added to this, there will be street entertainment throughout the weekend, with live music at the Farmers’ Market and the Red Patrollers appearing in Riverview Shopping Centre on Saturday afternoon. Sunday will see “Rubicon” play on Oliver Plunkett Street joined by set dancers.

> This year will see Director and Duke Special perform live outdoors on Sat  2nd June. Then on Sun 3rd June, Mary Black will headline the outdoor concert, supported by Jennifer Lomasney

There has been a lot of buzz around Director recently so it's a real coup for the organisers to get them.

UPDATE 1: To be honest, I'd never heard of Jennifer Lomasney. [She's seriously good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITBsdwwjqXU)!
