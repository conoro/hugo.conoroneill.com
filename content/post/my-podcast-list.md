On the off-chance you are interested in having a look at what I listen to on the way to work. I have exported this list from [Juice ](http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/)(ex-iPodder), uploaded it to my web-site and I'm now presenting it out using a new OPML viewer called [Grazr.](http://www.grazr.com/) [Just click here](http://api2.grazr.com/sandbx?url=http%3A%2F%2Fconoroneill.com%2Fwp-filez%2Fipodder-subscriptions.opml&width=500&height=500&fontfamily=arial&fontsize=11) and then down through the entries to see the list. You can even listen to some of them inside it.
