Do make it down if you haven't been before or haven't been in a while. There are a bunch of new great stalls. 

[Julian](http://bubblebrothers.blogspot.com/) from [Bubble Brothers](http://www.bubblebrothers.com/) also pointed out in a comment on the [Ummera Blog](http://ummera.wordpress.com/2006/08/24/bandon-farmers-market/) that there will be wine tasting in [Urru](http://www.urru.ie/) on Saturday too. So maybe wander down there after the market and check it out.
