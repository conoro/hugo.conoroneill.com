You eagle-eyed West Cork drivers may have noticed a big new sign on the back of one of the units behind Great Gas on the Bandon Bypass. It is the retail/warehouse outlet of newly launched [Curious Wines](http://www.curiouswines.ie/). Mike Kane, the owner, has put together a brilliant selection of wines which are not your usual supermarket generic stuff.

Their [web-site](http://www.curiouswines.ie/) has just gone live and it's a corker (boom! boom!). Another stunning creation by the shockingly talented [Ms Dent](http://www.sabrinadent.com/2008/11/18/curiouswinesie-launched/). I think it's probably the best looking and most effective wine web-site in the country and puts the major chains to shame. The wine value is also fantastic and you really should buy by the case and save even more.

I'm just looking forward to the tastings that Mike has planned since I'll be able to walk to them!
