Osc opened a Melon and Orange yoghurt yesterday to discover it actually contained Fruit of the Forest. So did two others that he checked. In one of his favourite books "Stink and the Incredible Supergalactic Jawbreaker", the hero (Stink) writes a letter of complaint about a jawbreaker that did not break his jaw. The result is that he gets sent a huge box full of sweets. I think maybe Oscar is hoping something similar happens here. 

His letter is as follows:

Let's see what reply he gets.
