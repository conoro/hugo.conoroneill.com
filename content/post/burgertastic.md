<div style="clear:both;"></div>Burger Blogs seem to be appearing everywhere but this guy [Two-Twenty](http://www.two-twenty.net/archives/000378.html) is an animal!

It turns out that Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles restaurant does burgers too. Bourdain became famous because of his book "Kitchen Confidential" which gave the low-down on the high-jinks in a restaurant kitchen. A great read.

His "Cook's Tour" follow-up was less hyped but also a very good read. The associated TV series was pretty poor.

His "Les Halles Cookbook" is fabulous but I've only read about a quarter of it so far. Tonight I'm checking for his burger recipe. The burger reviewed by Two-Twenty has me drooling at 8.30am. Burger, Fois Gras, Black Truffle, Red-Wine Sauce............
