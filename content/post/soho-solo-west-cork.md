SOHO Solo West Cork is the West Cork Chapter of [SOHO Solo Ireland](http://www.sohosoloireland.com/), a small business networking and support group. It offers the opportunity to connect with other independent small businesses in the region, to share, collaborate and socialise with people who face similar challenges.

[Calvin Jones](http://blog.cjwriting.com/) has recently taken over as organiser and is doing a fantastic job of re-energising it. He is [giving a talk on Wednesday](http://www.sohosolowestcork.com/social-media-for-micro-enterprise/) called "Harnessing the power of social media to help your small business". It's on in the Celtic Ross Hotel, Rosscarbery from 12:30-14:00.

If you are a small biz in West Cork and you want to build your professional network both locally and further afield, then you should pop along to this. It's a free talk but please [register your interest here](http://www.sohosolowestcork.com/social-media-for-micro-enterprise/).
