I've just cooked up the smoked rashers that Catherine got in [Urru](http://www.urru.ie/) during the week. They were gorgeous. I was surprised when I opened the pack to see that it did not contain a few thick rashers but lots of very thinly cut ones. This is exactly the way I like them - I've never been a fan of those thick cut things which often end up a chewy as old boots. They usually have the word "traditional" on them. If I see this word on Irish food products, my brain automatically replaces it with the word "shite".

But back to the [Ummera](http://www.ummera.com/) rashers. Tons and tons of fat which, as Anthony points out in the earlier post, is where the taste is. They cooked up and  crisped up beautifully. I popped the first one in my gob. The main things I noticed were that they were not very salty (again a plus) and the smoke flavour was nice and subtle. Sometimes on smoked food you get the sense that they welly on the smoke to make up for low quality meat. Actually, I get the feeling that some products have smoke "flavour" out of a bottle rather than real smoke. Not the case here. Wonderfully tasty rashers. I rustled up a BLT in double quick time and ate the nicest one I've had in years.

OK, so they are pricey - over â‚¬4\. But what would you prefer to spend your money on - a weekly mouthful of mass produced crap which costs you feck all but tastes of nothing or a less regular treat which costs a bit more but which you remember for days?

Tomorrow - Ummera Smoked Eel. Off to Clon now to see if I can find horseradish root and then on to Union Hall again to get my first ever lobster - unless I chicken out on the way.

The next posting will attempt to bring together Smoked Food products and [The Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/). But I don't know if my brain is up to it.
