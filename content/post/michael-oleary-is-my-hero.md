Just watch him [take apart this Panorama interviewer](http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_8298000/8298750.stm). It'll be impossible for me to take the show on the BBC tonight seriously.

He is not only hysterically funny but completely accurate too. Flying Ryanair is simple, you make yourself aware of the rules and work within them. I don't think I've ever paid more than â‚¬60 for a Ryanair return flight. Treat it as a bus, set your expectations correctly and you'll find them the perfect short-haul operator.
