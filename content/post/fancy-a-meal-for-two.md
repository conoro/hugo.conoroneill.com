I don't know a lot about wine and beer, but I know a man who does. Julian over at [Bubble Brothers](http://www.bubblebrothers.com/) has a nice competition on their blog. They import the gorgeous Japanese iKi beer (I had it in Wagamama a few months back) and are now supplying it to the Cafe Mao chain.

He wants you to use what you know about iKi beer and Café Mao and tell them which dish on the menu would make the best match for iKi, and why. They have vouchers for a meal for two, including iKi beer, at Café Mao - one voucher for each branch. Just leave [a comment here](http://bubblebrothers.com/blog/?p=479).

The crew, sans Julian, will also be at Taste of Cork today (pleeeeeeease stop raining) as will we. Looking forward to tasting and texting. See you there.
