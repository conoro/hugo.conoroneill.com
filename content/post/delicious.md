<div style="clear:both;"></div>I've been trying out del.icio.us for a week now and I **still** don't get what the big deal is. Yeah it's handy to have the online bookmarks. The RSS feed is kinda irrelevant for oneself but I suppose if someone was stalking me, they might be interested in what sites I am interested in and what tags I put on them. I take back what I said about tags in my previous Bloglines post below - they are actually handy for finding stuff by category (like GMail). But it's just ok, not a killer app. I'll stick with it for another while. Maybe I'm just anto-social (or even anti-social. Anto-social is what our coal-man Anto is) and don't get this whole Social Networking buzz (man).
