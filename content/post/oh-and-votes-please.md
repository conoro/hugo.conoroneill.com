For the new blog theme. Like or no like? Like but would prefer a Cork specific image in the header? Don't like cos it looks like mud? 

And while I'm here, we launched [blognation Ireland](http://ietech.blognation.com/) on Monday. It is part of a fast growing global tech news network called [blognation](http://www.blognation.com/) and it covers Web 2.0 and Mobile in Ireland. So if you are a techie or in a start-up and you read this blog but not [Argolon](http://www.argolon.com/) (you nutter), check out the new site.
