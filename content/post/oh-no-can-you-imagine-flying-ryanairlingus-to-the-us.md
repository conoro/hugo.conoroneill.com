I love paying €3 to fly to Gatwick but the thought of [them running trans-Atlantic flights](http://money.excite.com/ht/nw/bus/20061005/hle_bus-wla3918.html) makes my blood run cold. How many Bullseyes do they think they could sell to the average punter over 5 hours to deaden the headache caused by the yellow everywhere?

On the upside, I'd happily pay €5 an hour to have a PSP embedded in the seat back in front of me. But will he really do that?
