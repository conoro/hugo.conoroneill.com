Mike Newham has updated us on Car Sharing in Cork:
> We're pushing out the introduction in Cork till July the 4th because of the massive VRT changes that occur on that date.  We'll start off with eight cars on the road - 3 Ford Focuses (Foci?), 4 Ford Fiestas and 1 Transit Connect for delivery's and the like.
> 
> All will be low emission diesels with extra safety options and lots of helpful gizmos like bluetooth and sat-nav. They'll all be positioned in and around Cork City Centre.
> 
> We've made a decision to postpone the new website till about mid-May when it will be fully operational to allow new members to join and book cars.
> 
> By the way CarSharing for us is not ride-sharing or car-pooling, its basically the service by which you book a car for a number of hours, use it for those hours and get charged for those hours.
I really hope the mainstream media really pick up on this.
