I just got a mail from the lovely people in [The Good Things Cafe](http://www.thegoodthingscafe.com/) in Durrus to tell me that the awesome Carmel was on the [Foodtalk](http://newstalk.ie/newstalk/programmes/37/foodtalk.html) programme on [Newstalk Radio](http://newstalk.ie/).

Foodtalk is hosted by one of the best food bloggers anywhere, Caroline Hennessy from [Bibliocook](http://www.bibliocook.com/).

If you want to listen online and subscribe so that you get each broadcast, then there are a bunch of different ways of doing it.

On your PC, one of the best tools is [MediaMonkey](http://www.mediamonkey.com/). Install it, tell it [about Foodtalk](http://newstalk.ie/newstalk/podcasts.html), leave it running in the background and it'll automatically download the new episodes so you can listen at your desk.

If you have a newer car stereo or (like us) one of the replacement Lidl/Aldi ones, then you can copy those audio files onto a memory card or USB stick and play them in the car when you like.

Lots of the newer phones with Wifi also have podcasting capabilities. The Nokia N95, N95-8GB, N96 etc come with the software built in. Owners of the E51, E63, E71 etc can [download it from here](http://europe.nokia.com/A41107006). You have to manually tell the application to check for new episodes but it takes care of the download etc once you do that. You can listen directly on the phone or plug it into the line-in on your stereo or car-stereo.

If you have an iPod, I'm sure it's all very similar.

Note that most of the radio stations, in particular [RTE](http://www.rte.ie/radio/podcast/), have a ton of podcasts you can get like this. I recently listened to all of a year-old series about De Valera I grabbed from the RTE site on my N95-8GB.
