<div style="clear:both;"></div>I'm doing a trial of a client-hosted tool called [w.bloggar](http://http://www.wbloggar.com/) to see if it can work reliably with Blogger and reduce the overhead of making posts. Seems fine so far for the simplistic stuff I do.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
