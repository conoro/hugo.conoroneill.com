Damien [just posted the short-list](http://awards.ie/blogawards/2007/02/18/2007-irish-blog-awards-short-list-congrats-to-all/) for the Irish Blog Awards. I got through in all four categories in which I was long-listed. I think I need to lie down.

I've said it before and I'll say it again now - I have the smartest, sexiest, wittiest, funniest, bestest readers on the planet. Thank you all for responding so well to my daily emails begging you to vote for me. They'll stop now.
