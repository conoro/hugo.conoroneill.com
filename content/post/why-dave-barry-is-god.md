<div style="clear:both;"></div>From a 1992 Column in the Miami Herald Tribune:
----------------------
Speaking of true quotations, please repeat the statement that Sonda Ward of Nashville, Tenn., swears she heard made by a man expressing concern to a woman who had been unable to get a ride to a church function.

He said: ''Estelle, if I'd a knowed you'd a want to went, I'd a seed you'd a got to get to go.''
----------------------

Please un-retire Dave, please.
