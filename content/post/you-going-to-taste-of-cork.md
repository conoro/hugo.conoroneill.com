It looks like [Taste of Dublin](http://www.tastefestivals.ie/) this weekend was a big success and a huge improvement over last year. I was thrilled to hear that they are doing a [Taste of Cork](http://79.170.40.33/tastefestivals.ie/index.php?option=com_contentandtask=viewandid=73andItemid=92) from Friday 27th June to Sunday 29th. Over on [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/), we'd like to capture the quality of the event by having people review what they eat/drink/encounter by SMS. The most popular review will win a prize (suggestions on what that should be are very welcome).

Don't worry, you don't have to be remotely geeky to do the reviews. Both of my parents are very non-technical and they do SMS reviews all the time. You don't even have to sign up on the site, it'll happen automatically when you send your first review to 087-9409325\. Here's all you have to do:

There is a good [selection of reviews from Taste of Dublin](http://www.loudervoice.com/tags/Taste+of+dublin) here so you can see the sort of things people were saying. If you want to do it in Cork just follow the instructions above and your reviews will appear on LouderVoice a few seconds later. If you know for definite that you'll be trying it ahead of time, why not leave a comment here or ask any questions you might have?

The SMS are at your standard rate, they are not premium rate. You can also write long SMS reviews if your phone supports them. We'd love to see the feedback you all have on both the event and the exhibitors, many of whom are local Cork businesses.

By the way, if you run a local biz that is exhibiting at Taste of Cork, we'd love to provide you with mini-flyers to give out to encourage people to review your offerings. Either pop a comment here or mail me on conor AT loudervoice DOT com for more info.
