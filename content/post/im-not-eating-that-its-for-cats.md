Ois√≠n continues to come out with the funniest lines in the house. He refused to eat his dinner yesterday on the grounds that it was food for cats. Were we trying to feed him Whiskas perhaps? Or maybe KiteKat or Iams? No, it was lasagne.

All of this because his older brother, in an effort to get him to eat it, pointed out that lasagne is what Garfield eats.

Twenty minutes of tears, one taste and then he <strike>wolfed</strike> catted down the lot.
