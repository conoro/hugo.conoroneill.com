If you haven't heard about it already, you'll want to know about the [Good Wine Show](http://goodwineshow.com/) happening this Friday 13th and Saturday 14th of November. It's a joint effort between the three best independent wine retailers in the country: [Curious Wines](http://www.curiouswines.ie/), [Bubble Brothers](http://www.bubblebrothers.com/) and [Karwig Wines](http://www.karwigwines.ie/).

It's on in the Clarion Hotel in Cork from 3pm - 8pm on Friday and 11am - 4pm on Saturday and only costs â‚¬15\. For that you'll have over 100 international wines to taste and buy, delicious foods and gourmet treats on offer and prize draws for wine cases and food hampers.

This isn't a show for wine gurus at all. If you like a nice glass of NZ Sauvignon Blanc every once in a while, you'll enjoy it just as much as those who know the difference between a 1947 and 1948 Margaux.

You can buy tickets online right now or in any of the aforementioned Wine Merchants. [We'll](http://business.loudervoice.com/) be there on Friday and possibly on Saturday too, soliciting your feedback on everything so have your SMS thumbs to the ready.
