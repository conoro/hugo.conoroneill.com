Watch this video from Tony Hsieh the CEO of [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/), which sold this summer to Amazon for $928m. 

I have ordered the Zappos Culture book he mentioned (just email ceo@zappos.com and they'll post you a copy) and downloaded the Tribal Leadership audiobook [from here](http://about.zappos.com/tribal) (use California 90210 for your address in the registration screen). Wonderful stuff.

Most Irish businesses are still a decade behind the US exemplars when it comes to customer service. But one of our clients who really seems to get it is [Louis Fitzgerald Hotels](http://www.louisfitzgeraldhotel.com/).
