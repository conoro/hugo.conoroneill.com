Yes I know it's just another "kids say the funniest things" post but this wee 5-year old thinks deeper than most.

Never promise a bed-time story and then renege:
"Dad when I grow up, I'm going to get married like you, and have babies like you, and forget things like you"

Recent obsession with death:
"Dad, when we all die, does that mean someone else might live in our house?". "Yes they will Ois". "So like, they'll get all our DVDs?"

At least I've taught him to say "I'm going to be an engineer when I grow up, like my mum and dad". Of course he thinks that means he'll be fixing airplanes and computers. I'm having a hard time explaining the word design.
