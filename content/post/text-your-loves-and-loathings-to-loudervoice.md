We're really excited over on [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/) by this latest feature. You can now SMS your reviews directly to the web-site. So if you walk out of a terrible movie or wonderful restaurant or just want to get your opinion on any product or service off your chest, now you can. Those reviews will appear within seconds on the LouderVoice site.

The format is simplicity itself:

_Review Rating1-5 ItemName**:** Opinion_

It should look like this on your phone:

Then a few moments later, it will look like this on LouderVoice:

We have two numbers you can use: **+353-87-9409325** and due to lots of demand **+44-778-6205133**

Each SMS costs your standard network rate if you are texting your local country number.

And if you are feeling strongly opinionated, we do accept multi-message SMSes up to slightly more than 400 characters.

Just add your mobile number to your LouderVoice account (or sign-up, it only takes a moment), try it out and let us know what you think.
