[Ivan Pope has voted for me](http://blog.snipperoo.com/2007/02/snipperoo_users.html) in the Irish Blog Awards. Ivan runs a great tech company in the UK called, wait for it......[Snipperoo](http://www.snipperoo/). I knew there was a reason I put his widget in the sidebar of this blog rather than my business one!

In any case, 21 hours to go in [the voting](http://www.awards.ie/vote/). Check out my nominations to the right there, check out all the others over at [Jason Roe's blog](http://www.jason-roe.com/blog/blog-awards-voting-opens/), and if you think I'm worth it, gis a vote.

And check out Snipperoo, if you like adding extra functionality to the sidebar of your blog, it really is sweet. I'll be adding it to [Argolon](http://www.argolon.com/) and [LouderVoice](http://blog.loudervoice.com/) as soon as my currently very dicky tummy settles down.
