It really is a fun day out. Most of the town seems to head up. 

Fionn will love the animals, Sib√©al will screech at the dogs and the eldest boys will demand ice-cream from the second they arrive.

I'll take more pictures of huge cows which impress me every time. Hope to catch some show-jumping too.

Head towards Clon, turn right for Dunmanway/Recycling facility, right again about half a mile down and you hit it after another mile or two.
