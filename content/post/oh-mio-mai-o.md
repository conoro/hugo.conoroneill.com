We've had a couple of very good reviews [of Mio on LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/search?q=mio) and finally got a chance to try it out last Sunday. A brilliant meal in a beautiful but shockingly empty restaurant. We'll be back soon.

Granny Mary shooed us out the door at 5pm on Sunday and we tootled down to Clon to Mio's. Owned by the same people as the brilliant Gleeson's, it is two doors up and upstairs.

The room is beautifully done with a nice Italian feel to the whole place. It was empty on arrival so we got the full attention of the very friendly waiter. A couple of Italian Moretti beers saw us through the meal and we had a hard time deciding what to pick. Both the main menu and specials looked good but with quite run-of-the-mill descriptions, which as as discovered when the food arrived, didn't do it justice at all.

Catherine had a fantastic pate to start and I had pasta-wrapped prawns with a saffron aioli. Both with very good salad with a tasty dressing.

For main I had the Capricciosa pizza which had anchovies, capers, olives and an egg. One of the best pizzas I've eaten in the past ten years. Catherine had a classic Caesar sald with chicken. She couldn't finish it, it was so big. Lovely leaves and dressing, beautifully moist chicken. She didn't go for the whole anchovies in it tho. Might be best to mention as an option to people.

Two excellent double espressos finished the evening and we were out off home, fully sated.

Unfortunately not one other person came in whilst we were there. I so hope this was a timing thing and not a regular occurrence since Clon needs a place like this that serves great food in a relaxed setting. I am concerned that the menu outside gives no hint of the high quality of the food and could be mistaken for an Eddie Rockets style place. The prices are a little high but then I say that about everywhere.

If you like great pizza and great food in general but want it in a lovely relaxed welcoming setup then Mio is worth a detour. Next time I'm trying the burger.
