One of the best TV ads I have ever seen for a motor car. Must be a couple of minutes long and surely costs a fortune to broadcast. But worth it for them if they are ever to change the UK demographic from 55-85 to 25-35\. They rightly have much younger buyers in Ireland. Just checked and they have [some of the sound effects from the ad on their UK site](http://www.honda.co.uk/civic/) too.

I had a look at the car in [Kevin O'Leary's](http://www.kolgroup.ie/) the other day (whilst on my bike, strangely). Fabulous looking and much bigger than it appears in pictures. Not that I'll ever get one (some day I want to test drive a Type-R), our next car is a [VW Caravelle](http://www.vwcommercials.ie/configurator/index.cfm?fuseaction=variant&modelID=280&bodyID=4222).

[Finbarr Galvin](http://www.finbarrgalvin.ie/) up the road is selling a 1979 Roller. No price tag. Now that's what you need for sitting in traffic jams. Could you imagine arriving into work driving one? Would I have to wear a suit and smoke a pipe before they'll give me a drive in it? Or would the Civic be more comfortable?
