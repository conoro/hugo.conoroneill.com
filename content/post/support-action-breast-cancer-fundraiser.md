One of the most powerful blogs I read in recent years was Roos Demol's [One Breast Less](http://onebreastlessinireland.blogspot.com/). I'm thrilled she has re-started it and she is involved in an Action Breast Cancer fundraiser.

Please head over there and show your support.

> The concert, which still has no name (ideas welcome) will be held on October 29th in the Brogan Inn in Bandon. At the moment we are practising a barbershop song. It is quite challenging, but we're having a lot of fun with it.
