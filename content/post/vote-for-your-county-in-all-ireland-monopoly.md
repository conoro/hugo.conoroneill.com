Courtesy of [Jonathan Hill](http://twitter.com/infacta/statuses/39320882). Get your county into [the top spot in Monopoly](http://www.monopoly.ie/vote.aspx)! It looks like the entire population of Leitrim and Roscommon has voted with 296 and 258 votes respectively. Cork floundering with 31 and Kilkenny with 26\.

Note to Hasbro - maybe get a custom [PollDaddy](http://www.polldaddy.com/) widget created that we could all put on our blogs? It's viral baby!
