I found out about this movie/grub combo that is on next Tuesday (28th) on [The Slow Food Ireland](http://www.slowfoodireland.com/events-page23713.html) web-site. Clodagh McKenna describes it as follows:
> A showing of the new Irish film 'Short Order' in the Kino cinema, Cork at 7pm and following the film a spring supper at Cafe Paradiso at 9.30pm (there will be a half an hour gap so you can have a drink at Reidy's bar)
> Short Order is a new film from Irish director Anthony Byrne. A colourful, tongue-in-cheek surreal musical-comedy, starring Emma de Caunes, Jack Dee, Paul Kaye, John Hurt and Vanessa Redgrave. It’s a magical night in the lives of our protagonists: Short Order Chefs, Masterchefs, Delivery People, working out their philosophies between bites of honest to goodness, onions, garlic, lemon and rum drenched prawns, house special Osso Bucco (featuring the freshly chopped fingers of Bill Dodging Customers). A little bit of life, love and wisdom come together over one night in the culinary underbelly where life is a buffet and everything is short order.
> Please note that tickets for the cinema have to be purchased through the kino 021 427 1571 and tickets for the supper through cafe paradiso 021 427 7939\. Tickets for the supper are only available for cinema ticket holders and supper tickets are limited.  Cost: Film - €8, Supper - €35 (this includes a glass of organic wine)
I booked for myself and Catherine earlier. There was a wee bit of confusion about how/where you book but I think it is like this: The Kino does not accept Credit Card bookings on the phone but if you only want to see the movie then deal with them exclusively.

If you want the movie and the meal, then ring Cafe Paradiso and they will let you pay in advance for both the meal and the tickets. You still have to pop in at some point to get the tickets. When I was booking this afternoon, they had 15 people booked for food out of a max of 35 so get your skates on if you are interested.
