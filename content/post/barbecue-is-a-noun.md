I could be a cynical smartass and say that the people [in this movie](http://www.barbecueisanoun.com/) look a little too close to Christopher Guest's character in "Best in Show" but it really looks like a wonderful movie about people who are passionate about Barbeque/Barbecue. 

The horror that we perform in Ireland is what they call grilling (or more accurately "incineration"). What these guys do takes hours and hours and hours. I've eaten the result in Texas - they should have Michelin stars. Some day I'll try the Carolinas version.

Check [out some of the video clips](http://www.barbecueisanoun.com/clips.htm).
