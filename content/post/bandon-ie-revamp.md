Trevor and crew have done a big revamp of the [bandon.ie](http://www.bandon.ie/). Tons of useful information about the town and area and the beginnings of a local business directory. You should definitely be subscribed to the blog if you want the latest news. I push all their blog updates to [Twitter here](http://twitter.com/bandon) too.

The best way you can help the site is to make sure you let them know about everything that is happening in the town. It's a resource by the community for the community.
