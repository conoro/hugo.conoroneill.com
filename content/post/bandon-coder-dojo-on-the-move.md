[Bandon Coder Dojo](http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/144) kicked off this year and they have just made the move to St Brogans school at the top of the town. It's on every Tuesday from 6:30pm to 8pm.

They are currently focused on [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/), HTML and JavaScript. If you have any skills in those areas, they would really appreciate more mentors taking part.

Our eldest has just started using Scratch and is finding it good fun. Here's a screenshot:

You currently need to have a laptop to take part in Coder Dojo. I know this excludes a lot of people but [Camara Ireland](http://coderdojo.com/2012/09/18/camara-laptops/) has stepped in to help there. You can get reconditioned laptops from them via the Coder Dojo movement for between €114 and €125, which is a great price.

I also wonder if there is any possibility for school PCs to be used during the Coder Dojos too? Or perhaps, over time, [Raspberry Pis](http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs) which people can bring and hook up to the monitors there? This would maximise the number of people who can get involved with Coder Dojo, no matter what their financial situation.

Note that parents must accompany children for the entire session. If you have any questions about it at all, contact bandoncoderdojo@gmail.com
