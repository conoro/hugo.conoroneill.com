A phrase I have used many times in the past: "Only in Japan".

Check out this story over on Lifehacker on [how to peel a potato with you hands](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/cooking/video-demonstration-peel-a-potato-in-one-step-158620.php). Yet another piece of must-see pop culture from [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/). I think I'm getting addicted to that site.

I have my doubts if it'd work with a good old fashioned Irish floury spud. But I'm going to try!
