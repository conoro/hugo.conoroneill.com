I'm a huge fan of [Alastair Humphreys](https://www.alastairhumphreys.com/great-adventurers/) and I spent a fantastic hour or so talking with him after his session at the Red Hat Partner conference in Frankfurt last year.

  

He is just about to release his latest book [Great Adventurers: the incredible expeditions of 20 explorers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alastair-Humphreys-Great-Adventurers/dp/1783708417) and I have it on pre-order. I think most kids will love it.

  

It of course includes a section on the amazing Dervla Murphy.

  

Here's the trailer.

His earlier book series for kids, [The Boy Who Biked The World](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Boy-Who-Biked-World-Americas/dp/1903070872), was loved by our kids too.
