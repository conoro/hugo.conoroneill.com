![Irish Blog Awards](http://awards.ie/IrishblogAwardsSmall.gif)You can now [vote over on the blog awards site](http://awards.ie/blogawards/2007/12/28/nominations-for-2008-blog-awards-are-now-open/) for your favourite blogs and posts in a bunch of different categories. Sad to see that some of my fave bloggers like Sweary pretty much stopped in 2007 but glad to see some great new voices out there.  In my nominations I tried to pick as many new people as possible. Here's hoping 2008 will see even more great writing.
