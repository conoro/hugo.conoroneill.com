As with all the previous episodes, this one is a zinger even if you were a C64 or (god forbid) Dragon user. I had stopped my involvement with home computers by 1987, what with being in college and discovering drink instead. So I found it particularly interesting that they mention a game called "[Head Over Heels](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002259)" which was considered by many to be the greatest example of its genre ever created. 

I'd never heard of it so I've just grabbed it from [World of Spectrum](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/) to play on [ZX Spin](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/emulators.html) and they weren't joking. They did this with 48K of RAM. I think my watch has more than that. Never a huge fan of the 3-D isometric games but this is bloody good.
