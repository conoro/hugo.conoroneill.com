I just did a [Technorati search on Eurovision](http://technorati.com/tag/Eurovision) and most of the recent posts are in German. 

One poor lad was so excited he was counting down the minutes: "Noch 20 Minuten bis zum Start des Halbfinales".

Go [Scorpions](http://www.the-scorpions.com/english/)!

Pot, kettle.
