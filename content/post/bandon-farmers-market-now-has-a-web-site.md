I'm always happy to see local initiatives get an online presence to extend their reach. My attempt to create a blog for Bandon Farmer's Market three years ago fell flat due to my lack of consultation with the standholders to ensure buy-in. So it is great to see the new site launch with all the details you need. [Check it out here](http://www.bandonfarmersmarket.com/) and don't forget it is on every Saturday morning.
