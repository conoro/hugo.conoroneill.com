Dianne Curtin sent me some updates for this Saturday's Farmer's Market. I'll be there but I may be herding cats with all the kids in tow.

> Just to let you know the next market is this Saturday May 6th and after that it will be going fortnightly till mid September.  Demand from stallholders and customers dictated it!  Support from everyone in Bandon and the surrounding area has been phenomenal.
> 
> There's now freshly brewed real coffee on offer and hopefully this weekend there will be some food to go so shoppers can have lunch at the market. As well as that, this Saturday's market will feature live music from a new band,  'Gaslight',  aka Der Hurley, Sean O'Mahony and Mairead McCarthy, all local, who knock out great tunes from Van Morrison and The Beatles among others (weather permitting of course!)and there's a face painter for the kids.
> 
> To tie in with the Bandon Music Festival on June Bank Holiday weekend, the market will also feature  live entertainment, and a grand draw for a gourmet prize!

See ye there!

Just to let you know the next market is this Saturday May 6th and after that it will be going fortnightly till mid September.  Demand from stallholders and customers dictated it!  Support from everyone in Bandon and the surrounding area has been phenomenal.

There's now freshly brewed real coffee on offer and hopefully this weekend there will be some food to go so shoppers can have lunch at the market. As well as that, this Saturday's market will feature live music from a new band,  'Gaslight',  aka Der Hurley, Sean O'Mahony and Mairead McCarthy, all local, who knock out great tunes from Van Morrison and The Beatles among others (weather permitting of course!)and there's a face painter for the kids.

To tie in with the Bandon Music Festival on June Bank Holiday weekend, the market will also feature  live entertainment, and a grand draw for a gourmet prize!

See ye there!
