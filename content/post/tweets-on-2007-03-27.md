*   John Allsopp just release microformats book [http://tinyurl.com/2b6mbg.](http://tinyurl.com/2b6mbg.) Looks excellent but 4-6 week delivery on amazon.co.uk? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13494511)
*   Interested to know how any Wordpress users have Rich Text Editor turned on? We need it turned off to stop the RTE converting div's to p's [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13505461)
*   Google = Global. Google Blog = Valley. "Simply text your flight number to 466453". Hmm, wonder if that works in Cork Ireland......... [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13509161)
*   @imeallach - I know the technical angles on the editor (I've hacked it). I'm more interested in actual usage. Who enables/disables? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13510701)
*   I'm a huge WP fanboy but the Six Apart products are all far superior at preserving user markup in posts. And Windows Live Spaces? Arggghh. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13511641)
*   Roos says that Martin Carey in Bandon sells rabbit. Excellent. Never gutted one but should be fun. Lovely meat. Ah pretty bunnies. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13512411)
*   @PaulWalsh - We want to know what editor our potential customers use on WP. If many have RTE turned off then we have no issue. PollDaddy? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13516111)
*   Anyone doing Supernova in June or Innovate in May? Both look good. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13520731)
*   Wordpress Rich Text Editor usage poll on LouderVoice blog. [http://tinyurl.com/2uk3qj](http://tinyurl.com/2uk3qj) [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13527141)
*   I sooo wish Google would release JotSpot. Using Docs n Spreadsheets to do some mini-specs. Prefer Wiki. Socialtext impressed yesterday. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13611411)
*   Julian suggests a combined streaky bacon and rabbit come-back. He may be on to something. Martin gave ratatouille recipe. The 70's are hot! [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13649551)
*   @PaulMWatson - I believe there are several places around Ireland rightly looking at replicating the [it@cork](mailto:it@cork) idea. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13662021)
*   Harsh, but anyone driving fast in peasoup fog in Kildare today without lights got what was coming to them. I pity their poor victims. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13669381)
*   Wife and kids love The Killers. Until now they've done nothing for me but goddammit they're growing on me. Gotta love that last.fm [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13684141)
*   @damienmulley - Blogger Code of Conduct my ass. I have manners, others don't, you can't regulate for that. One for emailers too? And SMSers? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13690281)
*   3-year old announced she wanted heelies. Got her the old Fisher Price roller-blades with stabilisers out of attic. One happy child. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13791991)
*   @mattverso - not forgetting Twitter! We could use up 130 chars in each tweet with the appropriate code of conduct byline. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13809431)
*   No binary of PyLucene for Fedora Core 6\. Used to love building from source. Now it's just a PITA. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13898041)
