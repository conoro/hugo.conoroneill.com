Ben has just launched a very simple looking but really useful utility over at [Freewebtexts](http://www.freewebtexts.com/ie/vod/). It is a front end to Vodafone Ireland's web-text facility  (other vendors coming) . If you have ever used Voda's site, you'll know that it was clearly designed by someone who hates people and wouldn't know a standard if it came up and head-butted them (web mail that doesn't work behind many corporate firewalls. What century is this?).

Ben's applet is a paragon of simple effective functionality. Check it out and let him know what you think. He'll be adding functionality to it on a regular basis. And no, he doesn't want people telling him to re-write it as an Ajax app using ROR.
