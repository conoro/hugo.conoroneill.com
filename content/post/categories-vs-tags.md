I've been using Wordpress Categories as sort of generic Technorati tags. When I remember, I add some post-specific actual tags. I haven't really been that clear on the difference to be honest. 

[Lorelle has a big posting on it](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/09/categories-versus-tags-whats-the-difference-and-which-one/). And I'm still confused! 

Top-tip: Don't try reading anything technical after spending your lunchtime installing Oracle and testing ETL tools. Maybe I shouldn't try setting up an automated backup of a subversion repository this afternoon after all.

I think I'll just continue to make it up as I go along on this tagging mularky (malarky, malarchi, mullerky???)
