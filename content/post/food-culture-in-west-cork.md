I'm thrilled to see more and more great Irish food blogs being created and I was recently told about a real cracker.

Ivan McCutcheon, who works as a rural development officer with West Cork LEADER Co-Op and is heavily involved in the the Fuschia Brands initiative, has started [Food Culture in West Cork](http://foodculturewestcork.wordpress.com/). A must-read as far as I'm concerned. Check out his [great piece](http://foodculturewestcork.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/a-chance-to-show-off/) on Fishy Fishy and Ummera.
