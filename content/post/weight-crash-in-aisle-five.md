Not that anyone cares other than those who have to look at me, but I managed to drop a stone (14 fluid ounces in US measurements and 3 kilopascals in metric) in the past 4 weeks. Only 28 more pounds to go. Targeting another stone by Christmas but that is probably unrealistic. With the money I have saved from not drinking, I'm buying myself a new Ford Mustang.

Another apt "[Unfit](http://www.comics.com/comics/unfit/)" comic to celebrate.
