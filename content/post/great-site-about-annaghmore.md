If, like 99% of the local population, you think Annaghmore is the best idea we've had in Ireland since feeding PCBs to pigs, check out [this excellent site](http://www.annaghmore.org/) with information about it.

Any politician who votes in favour of Annaghmore is basically admitting to being a shill and will be out on their ear in the next election.
