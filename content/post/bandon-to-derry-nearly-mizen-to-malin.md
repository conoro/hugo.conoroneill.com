We finally did it. Up to Derry to visit the Pierce's. On the way up we over-nighted with Mary in Cavan and then arrived at Saturday lunchtime. Incredible location looking out over the Foyle. Great weekend.

On Sunday we braced ourselves for the return journey. There were three options - some bizarre route via Tuam suggested by AAIreland, via Dublin suggested by Eoin or back the way we came via Cavan.

We plumped for the latter but I'd be interested in hearing if anyone has other suggestions. We did Derry-Lifford-Strabane-Omage-Enniskillen-Belturbet-Cavan-Athlone-Roscrea-Cashel-Cork-Bandon. With two shortish pit-stops in Cavan and Fermoy, it took the guts of 8 hours to do it.

The N62-N55 backbone through Ireland is the main route from deep south to far north. Maybe it's time to consider the first Motorway that does not head towards Dublin? In some places, it is so narrow that trucks have to come to almost a full stop in order to pass each other.
