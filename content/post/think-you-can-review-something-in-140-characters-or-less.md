Then LouderTweets are for you. 

After a few late nights we're now ready to let you send reviews from Twitter to LouderVoice. We're calling them LouderTweets and they are 140 character mini-reviews you can send using Web, SMS or IM via Twitter to LouderVoice. 

So far we've had reviews of chocolate, couscous, a conference, a lawnmower and many others. Make your Tweets Louder!

An important point is that **you don't have to be a LouderVoice member to send LouderTweets** but you should join if you want to rate, bookmark and build/share useful collections of reviews and mini-reviews.

And how do you send LouderTweets as a Twitter user? It's very simple:

1.  Add the Twitter "review" user [as a friend here](http://twitter.com/review)
2.  Wait until you get a confirmation that you have been added back as a friend
3.  Post reviews using this format on Twitter:  @review RATING ITEM. REVIEW
4.  Example:   @review 4 The Apprentice UK. A stonkingly good series that has thrown up plenty of surprises
5.  That format is very specific otherwise we won't pick up the review. Rating is in the range 1-5\. Full-stop/Period mandatory.
6.  Shortly afterwards that review can be found by searching on www.loudervoice.com (in an open community microformat called hreview)

You can see an example here:

LouderVoice: [http://www.loudervoice.com/search?q=tesco+chocolate](http://www.loudervoice.com/search?q=tesco+chocolate)

As with all tweets, you can send your review tweet using whatever tool you like: web-page, Google GTalk, SMS, Tweetr etc

Let us know what you think.
