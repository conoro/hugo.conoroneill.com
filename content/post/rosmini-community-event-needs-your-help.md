I'll keep it short and sweet. If you know of any family-friendly comedians or mind-trick guys who would be able to perform on March 26th in Bandon, can you get in touch with me and I'll pass it on to the Rosmini Centre people? They do have some budget for it, so pro or semi-pro is fine.

Also the dog owned by one of the kids who was going to perform has gone missing. Please keep an eye out for a sheepdog in the Crossbarry area. If the same happens to you, I encourage you to post it on [LostandFound.ie](http://www.lostandfound.ie/lostform.html).
