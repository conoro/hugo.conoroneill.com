My old college buddy Eoghan Whelan has more metal in him due to sports injuries than the average Terminator. As a result, he knows more about pain and injury than most. For the past while he has run a [Pain Relief and Injury Rehabilitation Clinic](http://eoghanwhelan.ie/) in Dundalk and he now has the [beginnings of a blog to go with it](http://eoghanwhelan.ie/).

You can expect to see a lot of information about the treatments in which he specialises (particularly Frequency Specific Microcurrent) appearing on the site in the coming weeks.

If you are in need of services like this, Eoghan is a real pro and you won't regret having a consultation.
