<div style="clear:both;"></div>I've just found out about [IrishWan.org](http://www.irishwan.org/). This is a fantastic idea leveraging 802.11b technology to creat wireless WANs across cities and towns in Ireland. By connecting the Access Points to ADSL, the potential for reducing internet access cost in Ireland by sharing bandwidth and fees is huge. I must dust off the AP I have at home and see about getting myself an omnidirectional antenna. Anyone with wireless equipment and/or ADSL should get involved here.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
