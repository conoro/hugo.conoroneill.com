#### Best Bond since Goldfinger. Great plot, good acting, actually exciting stunts.

Initially everyone hated the idea of Daniel Craig doing Bond. Then the movie came out and they all ate crow. We finally saw it on DVD over the weekend and it was worth the wait.

It's back to the cold, harsh, darkly witty Bond of old with so much of the baggage of thirty years discarded. The only real gadget was a portable defibrillator to restart his heart. The vodka martini line was turned on its head and many of the stunts/action sequences were not ridiculous.

Craig acts well but I don't like the permanent pout. However the dangerous edge he adds is just perfect. As ever the Bond girls were disposable but easy on the eye.

The fight scene on the cranes was the most over-the-top bit but was brilliantly executed and I'd watch it again. There was finally some subtlety in the baddies/goodies with the wild card of the African guys being a nice touch.

Probably the best action/spy movie I've seen in the past few years.
