Michael Newham just left a comment [on my post about car-sharing](http://conoroneill.com/2007/03/22/car-sharing-in-cork-city/#comment-101146). It looks like this is going to happen next year. It's a great idea.

> Our company ‘Mendes - GoCar’ will be providing the car-sharing service in Cork City Centre. We hope to have it operational by May the 1st 2008.
> 
> Please see [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_sharing) for a good overview of what Car-Sharing is about.
> 
> All our ‘GoCars’ will have dedicated parking spaces ‘GoBases’ near high residential and business nodes of population.
> 
> Research has shown that in a successful car-sharing business each car added to a car sharing fleet replaces 8 to 12 private vehicles; thus reducing Co2 emmissions and congestion.
> 
> Another benefit to joining a car-sharing service is the increased use of public transport as well as walking and cycling.
> 
> We hope to have our website [www.gocar.ie](http://www.gocar.ie/) live by mid January. It will just be a brochure based site to begin with where ye can leave contact details to find out about membership and so forth.
