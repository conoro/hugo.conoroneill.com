I have created a simple new tool which enables me to send blog  
content via email. The emails are converted to Markdown files and then  
uploaded to a Hugo source repo on GitHub, along with any inline images.

CircleCI then automatically rebuilds and redeploys my blog to S3.

Iâ€™ll post full details and source code over the next few days.
