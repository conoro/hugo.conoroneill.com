I just had  a comment on one of my posts from a girl in Coláiste Na Toirbhirte wondering about summer work vacancies in Bandon. If you have any, or know of businesses that take in summer students, maybe post a comment here or drop me a line at conor AT loudervoice DOT com and I'll pass the info on.

Are there any sites that provide some sort of service in Ireland for this? Like a lightweight free irishjobs.com? I'd be happy to host one for nothing if there is opensource software available.
