We discovered over Christmas that you can in fact put 5 children, 2 adults and all their stuff in a Zafira+Roofbox and go from Cork to Kilkenny to Cavan to Cork. Hurrah.

On our trip back from Cavan on the joke's of national routes known as the N55 and N62, we got to Roscrea and Oscar decided to puke. We caught most of it in a nappy bag and then I dropped the bag as I exited it from the car. We pulled into the McDonald's carpark at the roundabout and proceeded to change both Oscar and Fionn. 

A McDonald's employee appeared and asked if we needed any help, we did. He headed off and got black sacks and a roll of kitchen paper. He introduced himself as Dave and stuck his card in my pocket. He then apologised for heading off but his shift was over. Two minutes later he reappeared with a cup of water for Oscar to wash out his mouth and another one of 7-Up which he told us to shake flat so it would settle Oscar's stomach (a trick we've used many times in the past).

Dave then left with the message to give any of the bits to staff and to just say that he had said so. I was so impressed with this guy. All of this help was unprompted and was deeply appreciated by us. I thought he was just one of the new-style Helper's in McDonald's which are a fantastic addition but when I checked his card later, I found he was the manager. 

Anyone who thinks McD's are going away any time soon had better wake up and smell the lattes they now serve. McD's are finally realising that customer service is just as important as the burgers to retain customers. It'll be employees like Dave who make that seachange happen.

Promote this man fast  - he's capable of far more than Roscrea!

Thanks again Dave.
