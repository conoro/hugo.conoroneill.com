Just spotted [on the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6296199.stm) that [The Jesus and Mary Chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chain) are re-forming to do some festival. I bloody loved that band. [Psychocandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychocandy) is in my top ten albums of all time. I remember playing it to my friends in 1985 and they all laughed at me. "But it's just noise Conor". "Wait, just wait, you'll see. This is genius".

Any movie that uses their music gets an instant thumbs up from me. I think that's why I have a soft spot for "[Lost in Translation](http://imdb.com/title/tt0335266/)" - they played "Just Like Honey" in the closing scene.

One of my favourite lines from a song:"Sometimes I walk sideways to avoid you, when I've annoyed you"

Now I'm just going to have to go off and listen to Psychocandy for the 4 billionth time. Gonna be hard to  get any work done.
