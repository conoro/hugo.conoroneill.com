My good buddy Damien had some [harsh accurate words](http://www.mulley.net/2007/06/04/why-sky-handling-partners-are-cunts/) to say recently about City Jet Handling (previously known as Sky Handling Partners). It now appears to someone in that organisation [has been using Damien's details](http://www.mulley.net/2007/06/20/sky-handling-partners-the-return-so-whos-signing-me-up-for-dating-websites/) to sign up to gay dating sites. He has not received a satisfactory response from them and wonders what to do next. I think a Solicitor's letter should be the first step. Anyone else?
