I have no excuse for the lack of posting here other than the usual busy-ness of life. I'll get back into writing mode very soon. Lots of blogposts and book reviews in my head, I just need to get them out through my fingers.

Speaking of reviews, I hope my loyal readers don't mind me doing a very quick bit of blatant promotion of [LouderVoice](http://business.loudervoice.com/). We have just kicked off our 2008 BES offering. If the mayhem of the markets has you spooked, then you may find our tax-efficient offering interesting. All details over on our [corporate blog](http://blog.loudervoice.com/2008/10/23/investment-opportunities-in-loudervoice/).

So for my next post, should I do a rant on Annaghmore (greatest idea since the invention of the square wheel), a review of "Drive On" by LJK Setright (stunning), a review of "Full On Irish" by Kevin Dundon (patchy) or something on why I think British Stand-Up Comedy is dead (having seen The Secret Policeman's Ball) ?
