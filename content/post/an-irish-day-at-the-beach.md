Where were the multi-coloured windbreakers when I needed them? Flasks of milky tea and gritty sandwiches would have helped too. But the kids didn't notice and had a whale of a time. Long Strand is still one of the most impressive beaches in Cork. I'm only disappointed that the para-glider-surfer-thingy dude disappeared before I could get a photo.

Ah shur the sun will come out any minute now:

I hope that's an overflow pipe and not a sewer:
