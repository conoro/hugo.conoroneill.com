I've just been called by an automated system claiming to be Cork number 021-42790990\. The message says that's I've won some bullshit competition and to press 9 now to claim it. You can be damn sure this either results in me calling a premium rate number or they'll just need get my bank details from me. So if you get some whiny American voice telling you to press 9 now, don't! Usual rule applies, you will never get anything for free from strangers online or on the phone.
