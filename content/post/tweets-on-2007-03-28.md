*   Worked until 1.30am, now my brain is mush. What can I do? Read a backlog of 20 must-read PDFs? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14172851)
*   Doing the upgrade from WPMU1.0 to 1.1.1 plus our customisations. Delicate stuff. I should have been a brain surgeon. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14186831)
*   Looking into Google Apps for your domain. Apart from yesterdays glitch, interested in existing user feedback. Also any news on JotSpot? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14205481)
*   Any way to get your Google Calendar reminders via GTalk? Seems like an obvious integration. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14213211)
*   @eirepreneur - I don't want gtalks for every mail, just the event reminders. Oh and why isn't Gmaps integrated into location field? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14231391)
*   On a Google rant now. Why no to-dos in GCal? Playing with "Remember The Milk" integration. Works but kinda obvious hole in the offering. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14231901)
*   well that took longer than I thought but new WPMU and theme up and running. Hurrah. Dinner time. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14348981)
*   Google Docs n Spreadsheets growing on me. Tried Zoho for a few mins but didn't like the default setup on planner [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14513581)
*   Arrgh, I finally upgraded [http://tinyurl.com/29jexo](http://tinyurl.com/29jexo) to WPMU 1.1.1 today and Donncha just announced v1.2\. Long night. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14592551)
*   Google custom home page not that bad. Have RTM, GCal, GMail and twitter widgets all on one page [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/14620641)
