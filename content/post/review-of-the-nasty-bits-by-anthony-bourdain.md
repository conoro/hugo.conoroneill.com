    _<span class="summary">A fine collection of articles he has written over the past few years on all things food and restaurant related. A great food writer.</span>_

    <span class="description">

This book has been on my ever growing pile of unread books for a long time. I finally took it on a flight to San Fran so I could make a dent in it. The format is perfect for picking up intermittently since each piece is from a magazine or other publication.

The range of articles is wonderful, ranging from "Woody Harrelson: Culinary Muse" about that cretin and the raw food movement to "Food and Loathing in Las Vegas" where he and the great Micheal Ruhlman do the frankly bizarre Vegas food scene.

Passion screams from every paragraph that he writes along with a sense of embarassment that he doesn't deserve the fame that he has. This actually stuck me when watching Top Chef recently where he was a guest judge. The competitors were in awe of him but as he points out in several pieces in the book, he was just executive chef in a French-style brasserie in New York. He ain't no Thomas Keller.

This is just a thoroughly enjoyable book where you'll like the writing and like the man. I know have a bunch more places I want to eat in around the world including some stalls in a mall in Singapore!
