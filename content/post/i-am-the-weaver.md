<div style="clear:both;"></div>To quote the great Bill Hicks.

Yesterday I tried to create a new classic instant meal. I decided to traverse the extremes from MSG to Midleton by creating a masterpiece consisting of Koka Chicken "flavoured" Noodles, leftover sausages and Organic Rocket Pesto from the Midleton Farmers market. Oh dear, won't be having that again. A fuzzy Nokia crap-cam picture of the gourmet extavaganza:

Next week, I will give details of the current greatest instant meal of all time which I have eaten since I was a kid: Heinz Spaghetti Hoops nestling on a bed of processed ham delicately covered in a layer of grated cheddar with optional Chef Brown Sauce. Plate-licking-tastic.

I recently convinced Ois?n that the Heinz Hoops were in fact special Bob The Builder Hoops which consisted only of Travis the Tractor's wheels. I can't believe the poor darlin fell for it. He now demands Travis hoops in preference to Scooby Doos.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
