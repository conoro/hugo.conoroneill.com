I deserve a slap for not doing this review until now. We ate in Deasy's in Ring for Catherine's birthday back in May with my parents. I had heard nothing but great things about it and they did not disappoint. Unfortunately I have the memory of a gnat so the details of the meal have all become a bit hazy (the wine didn't help either). I finally remembered to do the review when I saw fab recipes from the chef, Kaitlin Ruth, in The Examiner yesterday.

Deasy's is situated on a coastal road along Clonakilty Bay as you head towards Kinsale. It is right on a bend and the water is just on the other side of the road. Parking more than 4 cars is a challenge but it is not a busy road. The view is worth millions and this awful picture in no way does it justice:

Ring is heading towards being in the middle of nowhere and yet Deasy's is always booked out for the weekend. As ever, it proves that no restaurant can use location as an excuse for lack of custom. Deliver great product anywhere and people will flock to you.

The pub and restaurant are all the one and the old wood and old feel to the place is lovely. We were first to arrive for the evening and got the best seats in the house looking out over the bay to the Atlantic.

Most of the menu is seafood but there are veggie and steak options too. One of the recommendations I got for the place mentioned the great steak! All of it sound simple and sounded yum.

This review won't do Deasy's justice as I can't give you the details of all the food we had. I was enjoying it so much I forgot to take pictures! Suffice to say that it was brilliant. Everyone loved what they ordered. All of the fish was cooked to perfection and the sauces really helped the food rather than overwhelming it like most average seafood places tend to do. You can tell that the chef just trusts her great ingredients and lets them speak for themselves.

The only even barely negative thing I can say about the place is that at times the service was patchy but it was always friendly.

We will be going back here - a lot! They do a Sunday lunch (it is the only day that they do) and I have heard that is great too. As far as I know you can't book it. We'll be giving that a go very soon and I'll do a much better review then. 

If you are anywhere in the area and want stunningly good seafood in one of the best locations in the country, take a taxi out to Ring and have a wonderful night. You can call them on 023-35741.
