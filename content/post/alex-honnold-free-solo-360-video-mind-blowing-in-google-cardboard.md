If you don't have a [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/), you can still get some sense of the scale of what Alex Honnold achieved this year when he free soloed [El Capitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan) in Yosemite if you use the 3D controls in YouTube.

Free Soloing is climbing without any equipment or safety ropes. What Alex did is one of the greatest sporting achievements by a human ever.

I've no massive interest in climbing but after watching the Valley Uprising documentary last night (available to buy or watch or Netflix), I have a whole new appreciation for the mindset and philosophy of people like Honnold and [John Bachar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bachar) before him.

I'm also hoping to see [The Dawn Wall](http://www.dawnwall-film.com/) when we're in the US soon.
