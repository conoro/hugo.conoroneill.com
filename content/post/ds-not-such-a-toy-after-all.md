I think I like Oscar's Nintendo DS more than he does. He got Karts for christmas and I was blown away by how easy it was to set up with my wireless router so that I could play against other people on the web. Obviously I always come last.

But one of the hinges on the DS broke recently. Looks like a design flaw to me (considering the new DS Lite has a much meatier hinge). Glue would not work. I spent hours searching for replacement parts. Finally, I found a guy on eBay in Pennsylvania [who sold replacement cases](http://cgi.ebay.ie/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=8253509740&sspagename=ADME%3AL%3ARTQ%3A%3A1&rd=1) and would ship to Ireland. $24 plus shipping and a week or so later, I had the case. Then I discovered I needed a special screwdriver to open it. This time Lik-Sang came to the rescue and for a few Euro I got the screwdriver in the post less than a week later.

Last night we took apart the old one, moved all the bits over to the new case and were shocked to find that it worked! Fiddley as f**k but a damn sight cheaper than buying a new one.

But it got me thinking about the DS. It has two ARM CPUs and the main one has about the same welly as a Palm Tungsten T. It has two screens, one of which is touch senstitive and it has Wi-Fi. Would it not strike Nintendo to offer a web-browser as a plug-in cartridge? Or an MP3 player or a multitude of things other than games which would make use of all its features? I know it is outside of their comfort zone and they don't want to make the mistakes that Nokia made with the N-Gage. But still, it is a PDA in all but software. I fell asleep with that thought in my mind.
Anyway, I start checking blogs this morning and what do I find? [Opera are releasing a browser for the DS](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008813.html)!! Fan-bloody-tastic. Obviously, I 'll be keeping that cartridge for myself and not letting Oscar anywhere near it. I can't wait to browse the web at a wireless hot-spot in an airport using a kids toy.
And Nintendo are going [to release a digital TV receiver for it too](http://us.gizmodo.com/gadgets/portable-media/more-nintendo-ds-developments-tv-and-browser-154888.php). Not so awesome for us as we are now about 8 years behind on getting digital terrestrial tv in Ireland but would be tres cool for Freeview viewers in the UK.

PSP my bum.
