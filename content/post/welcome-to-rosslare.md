Give us €2 for every kid who wants to use the playground and shag off if you want to use it at 5pm on a Bank Holiday Saturday.

Hey, I've got a great idea, €5 per beach walk from 9pm to 5.30pm with a half day on Saturday.

But the nice new pastry place goes some way towards making up for the gouge.
