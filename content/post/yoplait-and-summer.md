We've got a big batch of Yoplait Orange and Melon yoghurts (the family favourite) in the fridge with dark fruit flecks in them (blackberry maybe?). Not a big problem but it also happened last year. Now I've just realised [it was almost exactly a year ago](http://conoroneill.com/2006/07/29/yoplait-make-oscar-mad-again/)! Very odd. Is one of the summer replacement staff colour blind ;-)
