Deeply important piece by Ivan on [food security and our future](http://foodculturewestcork.wordpress.com/2009/06/15/can-we-feed-ourselves/). Don't just read it, leave your thoughts too.

The ability of a country to feed itself and have a sustainable agri-business must surely have been a major motivator of Reddy Brennan and his team in Avonmore in the early 1970s. A man of great vision with incredible negotiation skills, he is one of the heroes of Irish industry. Our family will always be grateful to him.
