We got a call from Customer support in Yoplait last Friday week asking if we were in to take a delivery and to apologise for [the mis-labelled yoghurt](http://conoroneill.com/2006/07/29/yoplait-make-oscar-mad-again/). Shortly afterwards a courier arrived with two boxes full of these:

Osc was blown away, he could not believe that he got all this stuff for, as he put it, "some words on a bit of paper". He wanted to keep everything in his room so his siblings would get none of it but we pointed out that he needed a fridge for that.

In the interest of disclosure, I should point out that my Da worked in Avonmore-Avongate/ Avonmore/ Avonmore-Waterford/ Glanbia from 1974 until he retired and he did forward the original blog post to someone in there. But I have a sneaking suspicion it was the letter that did the trick. Consumer Food companies have to be very sensitive to any issues regarding food labelling and my guess is that they jumped on this as soon as they found out about it. In any case, Osc doesn't know that his Grandad worked there so he thinks they are the greatest company ever. Only 40 more probiotic drinks to get through......
