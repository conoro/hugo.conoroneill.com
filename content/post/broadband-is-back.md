If you live anywhere in the Cork/Waterford/Tipp area and have fixed line broadband with any provider then you may have been having problems since last Friday. I was getting 40 kbs instead of 2 mbs since Monday rendering the internet connection almost useless. Eircom fixed it for their customers yesterday and fixed it for their competitors this morning. Normal service should have returned everywhere. Yet another reason for us all to switch over to Wimax and HSDPA wireless broadband when it gets rolled out rather than using a set of providers who clearly couldn't give a damn.

UPDATE 1: Cancel that, it's gone down again.
