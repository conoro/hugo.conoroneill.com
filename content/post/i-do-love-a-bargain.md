I've mentioned Twitter many times on this blog. Bit by bit, it is going mainstream. It's a great way to hang out online (or on your phone via SMS or mobile web) with people you like and who can fit their thoughts into 140 chars.

But Twitter has a ton of practical uses too, one of which is saving money. My buddies in [Nooked](http://www.nooked.com/) have created a [ryanair_ork](http://twitter.com/ryanair_ork) account there which publishes some great special offers regularly on Ryanair flights from Cork.

Signing up on Twitter only takes a moment, then just "follow" [ryanair_ork](http://twitter.com/ryanair_ork) and enjoy the savings.
