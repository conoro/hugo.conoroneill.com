[The JCB Song](http://www.jcbsong.co.uk/jcbvideo.asp)

I'm hardcore baby!

I catch a bit of AM Kelly on Today FM on the way in to work. Jesus, does she ever play anything other than bland innofensive soporific music? Fair enough at 4am but something a little more noisy at 6.45 to stop me snoozing off and ploughing into the nearest tractor would help. At least Dempsey gets it and plays the Kickstart right after the news. This morning was "Bat out of Hell". Still makes me laugh every time I hear it for some reason. However, if it does get voted the best driving song of all time on Top Gear then there is no hope for the British driving public as they all drive crammed into the middle lane of the motorway.
