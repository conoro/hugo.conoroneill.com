It had to happen - they are making a new Knight Rider movie. I'm gutted to read&nbsp; that neither Hasselhoff nor the TransAm will feature. There are [some fantastic suggestions over at Jalopnik](http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/celebrities-movie-cars/who-should-populate-the-knight-rider-movie-173481.php) for  their replacements. My two faves are:

 [1 ] Jeremy Clarkson and a Ford GT40 

[2] Brokeback Knightrider with Jake Gyllenhaal as Michael Knight and Heath Ledger as the voice of the car.
