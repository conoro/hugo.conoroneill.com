Back in the blogging heyday I would sometimes post a few times per day. Sadly it's been a few times per year for close to a decade now, with social taking over. I'm going to experiment a bit with reverting to quick posts that normally end up on Twitter or Threads.

I must also use ChatGPT o3 to build a simple posting tool for the Hugo system this blog runs on, that doesn't require me to change how I do everything. The real power of vibe-coding - being able to solve problems for yourself in minutes, not days or weeks.

Anyway today's quick thought, inspired by Slavic Koza on the Ultra running mailing list, is about tech and getting old.

I've been wondering how I'll feel if I get to my 80s or 90s (my genes say I should) and whether I'll be able to get out on the trails/mountains.

And what it boiled down to was: Big tech wants to build VR/Metaverse nonsense and turn us all into consumer blobs. I want tech that lets me experience the real world even more.

If I make it to my 90s, I absolutely want a trail running exoskeleton that lets me get out safely on the mountains. Not some idiotic headset whilst I'm drip-fed in a bed.

So it's hardly a surprise that they are pushing Metaverse and Ozempic at the same time. It's the only way they'll be able to avoid a WALL-E blob future.

Let's not slouch towards their future, let's define the future we want by living it.
