So he is only five years old and this was his first ever GAA session. 

He reported back that he played hurling and soccer. His Nana from Meath better have a word with him about Gaelic Football. 

Next week we are sending him in Kilkenny gear to shake things up a bit ;-)

Bloody hell, now I have two hurlers in the house. Who would ever have thought?
