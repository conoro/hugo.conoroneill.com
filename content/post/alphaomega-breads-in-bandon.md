I love bread. Can't put it any more simply than that. So when I hear that someone who lives just up the road from me [is now making craft and organic breads](http://conoroneill.com/2009/04/04/launch-of-bandon-working-together-group/comment-page-1/#comment-148570) and they are selling them at the Bandon Farmer's Market every Saturday, well that make me very very happy.

Check out the [alphaomega blog](http://alphaomegabandon.blogspot.com/) for a list of their current products.Â I'll be checking out the bread.
