## Intro
I began this post several months ago. It started quite simply - I wanted to congratulate the vision of those behind the wonderful Waterford Greenway and encourage Cork County Council to embrace a West Cork Greenway and execute on it. However the more I thought about it, the bigger the "vision" got. What I'm going to present here is obvious in many places, controversial in others and probably pure fantasy. But we simply can't continue to stagger blindly forward, as we have been doing for decades. It's time for a fundamental change in how the infrastructure of this country is arranged.

Teddy Roosevelt, 1903: "We are not building this country of ours for a day. It is to last through the ages. We stand on the threshold of a new century. We look into the dim years that rise before us, knowing that if we are true that the generations that succeed us here shall fall heir to a heritage such as has never been known before. I ask that we keep in mind not only our own interests, but the interests of our children. Any generation fit to do its work must work for the future, for the people of the future, as well as for itself."

## Let's start small and talk local first - Bandon and Clonakilty Paths
Running or walking in Bandon for health in an exercise in aggravation. We somehow decided to name a nice short walk by the river after Graham Norton and the old railway walk after Clare O'Leary and it doesn't look like a single person in the County Council thought it would be a good idea to connect the two of them together. So if you want to make use of the railway walk, you either drive there (many do!) or you risk life and limb on a one-foot wide hard shoulder with cars whizzing by at 100kph and regularly crashing into one another.

Every road out of Bandon stops just as the houses do and leaves you in mortal danger is you want to go any further on foot. Hell anyone thinking of even cycling from Bandon to Innishannon is very brave.

Like many Irish towns, Bandon has a love-hate relationship with its river. It's lovely in the few small places you can see it. But its a beast that has damaged the town too. The relationship was typified by the Bandon Marathon which was run for a few years without a single view of the river. A marathon along the river would attract thousands. Imagine a Bandon to Kinsale run via Innishannon. On a permanent trail.

But Bandon is just one local symptom. Look at Clonakilty and Inchydoney. A beach rated as one of the best in Europe has a path out towards it that stops at exactly one mile. From then on, grit your teeth and hope some moron doesn't plough you down if you want to walk or run the other couple of miles.

Most of the rest of the country is exactly the same.

There are some bright lights - look at the ring road in Kilkenny any evening. It's jammed with people walking and running. Why? Because they can travel everywhere safely on foot. Literally if you build it they will come.

The Public Bike Scheme in cities shows what happens when you provide the facilities and infrastructure.

[Public bike scheme numbers show cycling is becoming more popular](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/public-bike-scheme-numbers-show-cycling-is-becoming-more-popular-751422.html?utm_source=iosapp&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=sharebutton)


## Waterford Greenway
Earlier in the year I heard about the Waterford Greenway and got very excited. The idea of being able to safely run, walk or cycle from Waterford to Dungarvan along the old railway line struck me as inspirational. I'm still shocked it has actually happened. I've been on it three times now, ahead of its completion and it far exceeds every expectation I had. The views are stunning, the terrain changes all the time and everything about it puts a huge smile on my face.

The important thing about the Greenway (and the Westport one and the upcoming Cavan one) is that it's a facility for everyone, not just tourists. And that idea became the heart of my thoughts on this wider topic. Given how many people I've met on the Greenway in its unfinished state, I can't wait to see it when it's finished.

## West Cork Greenway
Cork CoCo has a "policy" of creating the West Cork Greenway. An [excellent study]() was carried out in 2011, which figured out the how, where and cost. But nothing has happened. I don't want to particularly slag off  the new not-Alcatraz in the the middle of a freezing cold harbour, as it seems to be off to a good start in peak tourist season. But no one is travelling to Cork to see that. Imagine spending all of that money instead on a perspex enclosed walk across the Chetwynd Viaduct followed by a renovated Ballinhassig tunnel. It would rightly become world famous.

## Joining the dots
Now think about an East Cork Greenway. Now think about a New Ross Greenway. Now think about a Rosslare Greenway. Now think about a Dublin to Wexford Greenway. Imagine being able to safely travel on foot or bike from Dublin to Wexford to Waterford to Cork to Barley Cove to Glengarrif to Kenmare to Killarney to Tralee and Dingle.

Dammit, build a walking trail around the entire coast of Ireland. Something to make the whole world wake up and pay attention.

## The 80s
Like most Irish families in the 1970s we went on holidays in Ireland. And it was often wet. And there were campsites and caravan parks all over the country to support that. We went to Barley Cove 11 years in a row. But then Spain happened, and the Canaries and cheap flights. And over the space of 10ish years, all that business went away. But there was another business there that always existed and still exists - "Adventure tourism". All those people hiking, cycling, hillwalking, mountain climbing, kayaking etc etc. That business continues to grow globally but we have to invest to get it to come here. Greenways would be a huge boost for this and get tons more Germans, Italians, French, Nordics and Americans here.

SIZE OF ADVENTURE TOURISM WORLDWIDE.

## The Wild Atlantic Way
I have been extremely impressed with the [Wild Atlantic Way]() marketing campaign. Heck they make me want to move to Ireland and I live here. But that's all it is, a marketing campaign. The only obvious capital spend I've seen is for signage.

The core problem is that they show all these amazing places you can visit in Ireland and every single one of them requires you to drive there, since walking or running there would be suicidal.

We live on a stunning beautiful island. The Wild Atlantic Way should be The Wild Irish way for all of us, not just tourists.

## National Parks
This is a long section and after Greenways was supposed to be the bulk of this post. But it just made me have even bigger ideas. So bear with me, we'll get there.

2016 is the Centennial of the [US National Parks Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/centennial/index.htm) and they are doing a wonderful job promoting that fact. My only experiences of them was a day in Yosemite in 1996 and a day in Grand Canyon in 1998 and both are ingrained on my mind forever.

Let's start by comparing the mission statement of the [Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service](http://www.npws.ie/national-parks) and the US National Parks Service.

"It is the policy of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, endorsed by successive governments, to abide by the criteria and standards for National Parks as set by the IUCN."

vs

"The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. The Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world. "

Jesus. Are you as depressed as I was when I read the Irish one?

I had to Google to find out if we even had a National Parks service. I have been in one and to be fair, it's bloody brilliant - Killarney National Park. Check my earlier post on my Marathon there. But I've also done the Half Marathon down from Moll's Gap. The park is just fantastic. And in keeping with my theme, was full of both tourists and locals when I was there.

Expansion of the Wicklow Mountains National Park

The Minister of State for Regional Economic Development, Mr. Michael Ring T.D., today announced that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has reached an agreement to purchase 4,900 acres (or 1,983 hectares) of the Dublin Uplands, in the area known popularly as the Featherbeds. This land will be added to the Wicklow Mountains National Park, expanding the total size of the National Park to 22,000 hectares.

A Trail Runner’s Primer On Public Lands.
Today, roughly 640 million acres, or almost a third of the country, fall under the auspices of the federal government. As you move west, land-ownership asymmetry becomes apparent. In the 11 most contiguous western states a whopping 47% of the land base is public or federally owned, while east of the Mississippi River the federal government manages a scant 4%.

In 1872 Yellowstone became the United States’s first national park. Today, 59 national parks, administered by the National Park Service, can be found in 27 states. The purpose of the NPS is, according to its founding legislation, the 1916 Organic Act, is to:
“…to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.”

I hope this Doodle inspires everyone to enjoy the outdoors, which I think is one of the best things about America."





## Pedestrian Hostile in Two generations
How did we go in two generations from a piss poor country that couldn't afford cars to one which is actively pedestrian hostile. From every kid cycling or walking to school and even university to no parent considering that a safe thing to do.

Why did we sleepwalk into this?

The World Health Organization estimates that 1.25 million people die from car-related injuries per year. Half of the deaths are pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists hit by cars. Cars are the leading cause of death for people ages 15–29 years old.

Let's not forget cyclists who are regularly killed. The recent decision in Dublin to [postpone the bicycle greenways](http://www.thejournal.ie/cycling-greenways-2964771-Sep2016/) does not bode well for anything I'm proposing here.

## Health

"A whopping 92,432 people crossed a parkrun finish line in the UK this weekend" - Not whopping!

154,992 people crossed a parkrun finish line at the weekend worldwide, thanks to 13,418 amazing volunteers. A new global attendance record. Minuscule.

Operation Transformation - Great but tiny numbers
Sli na Slainte - Great but tiny numbers
Obesity
https://www.sportengland.org/research/who-plays-sport/national-picture/

"The number of people taking part in athletics weekly has risen from 1.3 million in 2005-06 to almost 2.4 million today."

Charity Walks - wonderful but one offs
People walking for health but not particularly enjoying same urban loops over and over
Similar to meat consumption, people want to show wealth via car ownership. Between environment and vision of Uber and Tesla, in future many won't own cars. Need to make walking the default again. Without ruining town centres like the UK. Carrot not stick has to be the default

How to get the people who need to move the most moving, but who are least likely to do so? Do we just have to focus on kids?
Cannot expect people to willingly walk around boring rural towns for "the good of their health". However people might take advantage of country, forest and river trails because they are beautiful and are good for the mind and body.

The JFK 50 Mile was first held in the spring of 1963.  It was one of numerous such 50 mile events held around the country as part of President John F. Kennedy’s push to bring the country back to physical fitness.



## France
France has lots of problems. But it seems to have some concern for pedestrians, at least where I was on holidays this summer. We went to a holiday/caravan park in Marennes, south of la Rochelle, for the second time. Many people who go to these kind of places, never leave except maybe to drive to the supermarket. I know we've been guilty of that.


And in an urban context:

In Paris, Plans for a Seine Reinvention
Mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced an "almost philosophical project" to take the famed river's quayside back from cars.

http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/05/in-paris-plans-for-a-river-seine-reinvention/392639/



French Country roads. No hedges, wide flat verges. Why do we rely on land owners to maintain?
Could we remake our countryside without major damage to wildlife. On roads only, not all hedgerows. Does France have fewer birds or bees? I saw wild deer on a run on a normal country road in France. Chances of that happening here?

## Hedgerows
OK, now for the controversial bit. It's time to get rid of all our our roadside hedgerows. All of them. Wait, wait, before you blow a gasket and start calling me names. First, we need a massive re-forestation program to ensure that birds and wildlife have somewhere to go to.

Oh but it'll take years.

## A New Ireland
A whole new outlook needed
Impossible to walk safely to country schools. Every child should be able to walk and cycle to school.
A grand vision for health
What percentage of N Billion health budget is on preventable no-exercise related diseases?
A grand building program. Large capital investment. This doesn't have to be expensive paved or tarmac or cobble lock. Crushed hard core is sufficient. But it also can't be a poxy white line painted on a road with a few "caution pedestrians" signs. The criminal negligence of Irish drivers at pelican crossings makes that unacceptable.
A real analog to rural electrification, not Pat Rabbittes joke of a broadband "plan"
What politician wants to be remembered like Noel Browne or Donagh O Malley? People who had a long term vision for the country, not short term operators who'll be forgotten in 5 years.
It needs to be more than a marketing plan. It needs to become part of our culture again.
Running, cycling, walking, hill walking.
Give pedestrians the right of way by default everywhere.
The role of Coillte? Whilst it's great to see hem adding things like Zipit in Farran wood, it costs money. It also costs money to park there. But you'd be suicidal to try and get there on foot. Health shouldn't require wealth.
The role of the OPW?
Conflicts of interest? Revenue generation vs good of the people.
Can't be years of consultants reports and local government jollies and civil servant conservatism
Has to be a revolution
Jobs, health, tourism, income, environment. Ireland leading the way in Europe. Just Like with fags and bags but with 100x the long term benefit.
A government looking for an anchor for a program for government could use this
A grand plan
Politicians want to be remembered for something? Like JFK, Teddy Roosevelt, Donagh O'Malley. Or just seat-warmers doing whatever Sir Humphry tells them to do.

"As a matter of principle, one should assume changes to urban landscape from autonomy will be at least as important as those from cars"

So we need to prepare now. We need to set the rules for what we are going to accept.

Self-driving cars changes things - except where it has to decide whether it kills you or the driver in the case of an unavoidable collision.



## Sidenote - Dogs and Dogshit
I'm getting to the point where I think dogs need to be temporarily banned from the public highways until a large proportion of their idiot owners stop behaving like 12th century peasants throwing their shit onto the street. Pick up your dogs' shit and put your dog on a goddammed leash you morons. Waterford is thinking of banning dogs from the Greenway. Given that it's already riddled with dogshit, they are 100% right.

But there's actually a revenue opportunity here. Dog-runs. Places that dog-owners can go to walk their dogs and step in each others shit. Lots of farmers could create these.

## Revenue and Cost
Split the narrative between how things will generate income for the country and how those things benefit the population. Can't all be about one or the other.
Adventure Tourism - We can't compete on heat

The scheme is not available nationwide; it was initially rolled out in the 12 areas of the country where Rural Recreation Officers are employed.  At the end of 2010 the scheme extended to 49 approved walking routes with a total of 1,819 landowners receiving an average annual payment of approximately €1,100.

[€4.455 million approved by Minister Ring for 75 Rural Recreation Projects](http://www.ahrrga.gov.ie/e4-455-million-approved-by-minister-ring-for-75-rural-recreation-projects/)

Figures available from Fáilte Ireland reveal that in 2014, close to 1.2million visitors to Ireland took part in hiking or cross country walking. These activity tourists spent in the region of €915 million in the Irish economy during their stay.  Similar statistics reveal that 286,000 visitors took part in cycling activities with a related spend of some €268 million. These two sectors combined generated revenue for the Irish economy in the region of €1.2 billion in 2014.

And this is in a country that's actively hostile to both walkers and cyclists. Imagine how much revenue we could generate if we made their lives easy?


## But but, this is how things have always been
........in your lifetime. A pre-famine landscape looked nothing like this. A pre-deforestation landscape looked nothing like this.

Douglas Adams:

“I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”
