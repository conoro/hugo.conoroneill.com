Has it really been 13 months since I did a personal blogpost? So many things I've been meaning to share over the past year but never got around to. I'll make sure to do my annual race/run wrap-up post over Christmas and I really want to get back into the regular blogging saddle since I've left Twitter and Facebook long behind.

And speaking of the two hellsites, this post by Sabrina Little on iRunFar is a perfect summary of how I have been feeling about online (and real-world) discourse over the past few years.

Read it, think about it and only leave a comment if you really get it.
