<div style="clear:both;"></div>So I finally moved over to Blogspot so that publishing of this is now trivial and doesn't require an
ftp server somewhere. Hopefully this means I'll post news more often. Also looking at MSN Spaces but I'll stick with this for the time being. Tons of bits and pieces which I haven't reported on over the past few months; new niece Rachel, new house in Old Chapel, Argolon work expanding nicely, waistline not expanding but not shrinking, and no christmas shopping done yet.
