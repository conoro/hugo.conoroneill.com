Only 20 minutes to go before the bloodfest of the final episode of The Apprentice. Everything I have read gives it to the Princess of Darkness but I'm still rooting for the woman who puts the Badger in Ruth Badger.

Ruth is like a good Tequila - it scares you just a bit but always delivers the goods.

I'm convinced that Michelle will turn out to be the prototype for Amstrad's new generation of [FemBot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fembot).

Does that mean Ruth is [Steve Austin](http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/staustin.htm) or [Jaime Sommers](http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/b/bionwom.htm)?
