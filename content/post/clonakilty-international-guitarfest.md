Ray in deBarras in Clon mailed me to tell me about the Guitarfest starting on September 20th. I'm glad he did since it looks fantastic. Lots of details on [their very cool site](http://www.clonguitarfest.com/). MySpacers should check them [out here](http://www.myspace.com/clonguitarfest).

The line-up has a very rich mix of styles but the one that caught my eye has to be [Eric Bell](http://www.ericbellband.com/), the Thin Lizzy founding member who is responsible for the classic Whiskey in the Jar!

If you are anywhere near West Cork from 20th-23rd, you owe it to yourself to get to Clon.
