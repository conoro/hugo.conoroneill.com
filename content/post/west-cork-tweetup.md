If you had never heard of [Twitter](http://twitter.com/conoro) before, the relentless coverage of it on RTE and elsewhere recently must surely have changed that. It's a simple system for messaging people who follow you but in a completely public way. You can pick whose messages you see by default too. Here's a quick snapshot of those I follow:

One of the nice aspects of Twitter is that it leads to real-world interactions too. There are regular meet-ups called Tweetups where people can have a few drinks, maybe a bite to eat and have a bit of proper social interaction.

Ann Donnelly is organising West Cork's first ever Tweetup in Clonakilty this Friday. It's on in the Courtyard Bar in Clon from 8pm. If you are on Twitter or want to find out more about it or just want to meet with some friendly people then why not head on over? [All details are on the blog](http://seoireland.blogspot.com/2009/03/west-cork-tweet-up-friday-27th-march-in.html).

Here are some of the West Cork (I'm including up to Ballincollig and Macroom in West) Twits that I know about: [Ann](http://twitter.com/omahonydonnelly), [Mike Kane](http://twitter.com/curiousmike), [Matt Kane](http://twitter.com/curiousmatt), [Anthony Creswell](http://twitter.com/ummera), [Catherine](http://twitter.com/manicmammy), [Simon Whelband](http://twitter.com/swhelband), [Calvin Jones](http://twitter.com/calvin141170), [Walter Higgins](http://twitter.com/walter), [Me](http://twitter.com/conoro), [Randy](http://twitter.com/branedy), [Margaret Jordan](http://twitter.com/margaretjordan), [Gordon Murray](http://twitter.com/gortron).
