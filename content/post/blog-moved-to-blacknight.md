8 years after I first registered conoroneill.com, this blog is finally hosted in Ireland where it belongs. Based on all the great feedback I heard about [Blacknight](http://www.blacknight.ie/) and the fact that they are great supporters of the Irish tech startup community, I went with them.

We're on the SOHO package with is just â‚¬35 per year ex-VAT and it does everything I need. The move was extremely easy to do. I just copied all the Wordpress files off the old host, copied the Wordpress Database, loaded both up on Blacknight and told GoDaddy that the blog is now there.

All in all, maybe an hours work including email account setup? The one glitch I had was solved by their support people in less than 10 minutes. The blog feels a lot faster, I hope it's the same for you.

Full review coming soon once I've poked around a bit but so far it's 5/5\. If you are thinking of setting up a blog, go for their blogger package and you'll be up and running with close to zero effort or knowledge.

p.s. if you didn't see a bunch of posts from the past two weeks, that's my fault. Should be working ok now.
