<div style="clear:both;"></div>Well the wee fetus has turned out to be a boy. We had the 21-week scan yesterday and even I could tell it was a bloke! He is slightly above average weight and all looks perfect. A couple of scans will be posted soon (including a High-5 which is pretty neat). Ois and Osc are thrilled "So that'll be 4 boys and only 2 girls in the house. Brilliant!". Names we have come up with so far to annoy my mother include Cavan, Mossie, Moses and Cruz.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
