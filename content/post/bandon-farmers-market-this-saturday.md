### Bandon Farmer's Market

Sat, 17 Jun 2006 at 10:00 AM

Old Market Garden

New Spar Car Park

Bandon, Co Cork     

Ireland
The next bi-weekly Bandon Farmer's Market is on this Saturday in the usual place. I missed the last one so I'll definitely be heading down to stock up on breads, coffee, eggs, veg, sweeties for myself for Father's day, pickles, smoked goods, herbs and anything else I can carry!

See you there.

I've added the market to both [Upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/event/85379) and [Eventful.com](http://eventful.com/events/E0-001-001046500-1) to make this one of the first Web 2.0 Farmer's Markets :-)
