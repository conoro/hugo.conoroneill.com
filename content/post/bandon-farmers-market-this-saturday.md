The next bi-weekly Bandon Farmer's Market is on this Saturday in the usual place. I missed the last one so I'll definitely be heading down to stock up on breads, coffee, eggs, veg, sweeties for myself for Father's day, pickles, smoked goods, herbs and anything else I can carry!

See you there.

I've added the market to both [Upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/event/85379) and [Eventful.com](http://eventful.com/events/E0-001-001046500-1) to make this one of the first Web 2.0 Farmer's Markets :-)
