When the [Irish Blog Awards](http://www.awards.ie/) nominations open early next year, I'm pretty sure Ivan McCutcheon's recent post [about local West Cork abbatoirs and butchers](http://foodculturewestcork.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/local-abbatoirs-whats-at-steak/) will be the one I pick.

If you care about the food you put in your gob and appreciate the work of people with a passion for their craft, read Ivan's piece, print it off and give it to those you know.

For so many reasons, it is imperative that businesses like Dan Maloney's in Bandon survive and thrive. Supporting local food production is good for community, business, the environment and the economic independence of the country.
