I don't know whether this is good or bad news, and either way it has no impact on my life, but [Lous Vuitton is buying Aston Martin](http://www.autoblog.com/2007/02/01/scoop-louis-vuitton-buys-aston-martin/). Sure they are both luxury brands but mixing handbags and camshafts - I'm just not sure. It smacks of one of those "synergy" horrors which used to be so common.Â  Maybe Daniel Craig will sport a man-purse in the next Bond movie.

Hopefully they'll do something about the rear-end of all recent Astons which to my eye are identical to a mid-1990's Mazda.
