A friend of a friend is visiting Cork soon and is wondering if any restaurants can assure him that their dishes are nut-free? This person feels that many would use vegetable oil with nut traces when cooking. 

It's a tough one I know but any tips would be appreciated. If you run a restaurant and are willing to make the assertion, even on a sub-set of your dishes, feel free to comment here.
