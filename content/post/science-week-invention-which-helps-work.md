Today's [Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.ie/) Question is an easy one "**Which invention has helped you most with your working life?**". Of course it is the internet. The highlights of my history with it are as follows:

*   1990: Learned it existed when I started Masters in UCD
*   1991: Figured out email, Usenet news, Gopher. Discovered ftp.funet.fi and the world of shareware
*   1992: First job in S3\. Email only. Figured out ftpmail to download programs overnight on 14.4k modem
*   1994: Found out about the web. Used Mosaic for the first time
*   1995: Discovered Free software, FSF, GPL, Open Source OS called RTEMS and GCC.Yahoo, Excite, Altavista, Lycos
*   1996-2000: Web developed and so did I. Online purchasing, Google, Yahoo mail, IOL, indigo, eircom.net, ISDN, Netscape, Mozilla, Internet Explorer, Geocities, homepages, animated gifs
*   2001-2003: Startup with ISDN only. Discovered SEO, dmoz, blogging, RSS
*   2003-now: Live it and breath it 16 hours a day. DSL, mobile, ATOM, Reviews, Semantic Web, Web 2.0, Social Networking, IM, Skype, Firefox, Widgets, Flash

The greatest invention in my lifetime and my job would not exist without it.
