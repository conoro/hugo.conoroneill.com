The 'Bandon - Working Together' group seeks to promote the strengths of the town through communication and activities. Their first activity is the creation of a 'What's on in Bandon' newsletter. If you want to get a mention in it, head on over to the [Bandon.ie blog](http://www.bandon.ie/blogspot/2009/04/bandon-working-together.html) for all the details.

I'm shooting them a quick email now about doing a blog and email list.
