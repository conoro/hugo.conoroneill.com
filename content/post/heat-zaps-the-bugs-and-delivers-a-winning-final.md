I had written off this series by the third episode but it still showed glimmers of quality. Luckily those glimmers shone through to beat off the bozos and tooth veneers. The final gave us the two best chefs who were clearly passionate and capable.

The food they cooked was fantastic, the mistakes understandable and the emotion strong. My heart was with Ann but I knew in my gut that Paul would clinch it at the end. However I do think she'll be the one to follow her dream and open that cookery school in Italy. Kevin Thornton had obvious affection and admiration for her.

Dare I say it, I'm looking forward to the next series. But please please please, dear production company, use this crazy new fangled thing called the internet to encourage foodies not media whores to apply. There are enough of us foodie bloggers out there to create a buzz and get you applicants who care about food and cooking not 15 minutes of pseudo-fame.
