ElectricNews reports that [Vodafone launches flat-rate 3G access](http://www.electricnews.net/news.html?code=9705305).

€49 incl VAT sounds excellent but I'll bet that is on top of a basic plan so there is no way we will end up paying less than €78 EUR per month. Fine if you are in business, silly if you are not. Another wasted opportunity? I'd be ringing them now to sign up if they halved the price.

I think I quoted a tenner as being reasonable. Most of us might stretch to €20 but €49 is yet another gouge attempt by people whole main source of income is a text transmission system designed for system messages.
