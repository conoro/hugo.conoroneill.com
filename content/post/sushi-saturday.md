8 years after I first bought a tube of wasabi to make sushi, I finally managed to get everything in one place and made my first ever batch. I followed the instructions in "[Rachel's Favourite Food for Friends](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0717139999/qid=1145733210/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_3_2/203-0253879-1863917)". It turned out damned tasty but not exactly pretty. I'm sure sushi experts would cry over my efforts. Some pictures below. In case you are wondering, the kids medicine syringe was to measure out 30ml of rice vinegar. I wasn't in the scouts for most of my youth for nothing!

One question - why does the seaweed smell of fish?
