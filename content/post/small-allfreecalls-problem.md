I decided to try out [AllFreeCalls.ie](http://AllFreeCalls.ie) this afternoon. I had to ring Casio Customer Support in the UK about my poxy unfixable watch and my guess was that it would a longish call. I rang the access number and a voice told me that I would be charged at local rates and to enter the number I wanted. I entered the UK number and got through to the queuing system in Casio immediately. I did notice a reasonable amount of noise on the line which I assume is a VOIP artifact. I was asked to press "2" on my phone which I did, repeatedly, to no avail.

I hung up and re-rang the number using [Gizmo](http://www.gizmoproject.com/) (I have Call Out credit) and this time my keypress worked fine. So it looks like the DTMF tones are getting sufficiently distorted that they don't work on AllFreeCalls.

Not a huge deal and it will affect very few people. And still a sweet service.

A question popped up today when my wife had to ring her sister in the US. The sister was on an Irish mobile. Just wondering if [a] AllFreeCalls can handle that scenario and [b] how much the call would cost both parties? A perfect candidate for [Roam4Free](http://www.roam4free.ie/) but she has a company mobile.

And no, the Casio people still couldn't sort out my dodgy watch. Grrrr.
