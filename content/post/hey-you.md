Norm Geras has [given the history of one of my all time favourite one liners](http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2006/09/birth_of_a_joke.html) from a stand-up comedian. It is Michael Redmond's piece of perfection "a lot of people say to me....."

I heard that for the first time back in the early 1990's, probably on one of the stand-up shows on TV. Or did he support Dylan Moran at some Irish gig?

It was around&nbsp;the same time that Mr Trellis were are their peak and Ardal O'Hanlon delivered his best ever joke. I'll paraphrase it badly here:&nbsp;"My Dad has a great sense of humour. Once, I put the price sticker off a bar of chocolate on the fridge and said 'Hey dad, look, the fridge only cost 32p'. 'No it didn't' he replied, 'it cost Â£299'"

OK, ye had to be there.
