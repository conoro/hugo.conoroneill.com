<div style="clear:both;"></div>I have finally uploaded some photos of the wee mite to Flickr. He is now feeding on 1oz an hour which we are going to have to fix pronto. Oscar and Oisín completely relaxed about the whole thing. Poor Sibéal a bit put-out but being very good really. Any chance of weather somewhere between lashing rain and scorched earth?
