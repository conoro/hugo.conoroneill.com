The annual Bandon Agricultural show is on this Saturday having been delayed due to atrocious weather in May. This is a great day out for the family and covers far more than championship cattle! We had a giggle there last year and this year looks even better.

The flyer advertises the following:

Music by The Pot Belly Folk
Vintage Display of Machinery, Cars and Tractors
Bouncy Castle
Mobile Pet Farm
Puppet Show at 2.30
Best Dressed Family and Teenager Competition
Baby Show at 3.30
Driving Competitions (aka parking in the field ;-))
Exhibition of Llamas
Heineken Cup courtesy of Niall O'Driscoll
Fun Dog Show at 3.30
Grand Parade of Champions

A free bus will go from Harte's Pharmacy from 12.20 onwards.

As always, well done to the organising committee for putting together a great line-up and to Lady Jennifer for providing the venue.  

This is also on [Eventful.com](http://eventful.com/events/E0-001-001047083-6).

Easiest way to get there is to head towards Clonakilty from Bandon, about 2 km out turn right at Blacksticks towards Dunmanway, take first small turn right again (heading back towards Bandon), and follow the signs.
