In a more litigious country, the HSE would now find itself on the end of a class action suit due to the [non-administration of the BCG](http://www.examiner.ie/irishexaminer/pages/story.aspx-qqqg=ireland-qqqm=ireland-qqqa=ireland-qqqid=28971-qqqx=1.asp) to children in the Cork region. The only region in the country that does not do it.

The HSE now have a moral duty to to provide the BCG to every single person born in this region who was never given it. Or maybe it would be cheaper to fill the Cappagh and Blanchardstown again. 1950's here we come.

UPDATE 1; Just to clarify - 5 tested positive for the antibody and three of those were due to BCG.
