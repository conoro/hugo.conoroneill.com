Dirk, who has written the most excellent Postie plugin for Wordpress is
putting a ton of effort into tracking down why I can't send an MMS picture
message from Vodafone to the blog using his plug-in. We are now testing
other mail clients to see if they work. This one has a picture attached as
the suspicion is that pictures are causing the problem.
