Two of my favourite automotive blogs used to be [Autoblog](http://www.autoblog.com/) and [Jalopnik](http://www.jalopnik.com/). I had to unsubscribe from both due to the huge number of posts they were doing daily which I just could not keep up with (same reason I only lasted a few weeks with [Blogorrah](http://blogorrah.com/)). 

Alex Algard mailed me last week to tell me about a new car blog that he has launched called [CarDomain Blog](http://blog.cardomain.com/). I have to say it is the dogs for over-aged car nuts like me. Yeah yeah, I know I drive a Mondeo, but just wait until I have a mid-life crisis and then it's Mustang all the way baby.

Check it out - great pictures (not just car pr0n) and huge enthusiasm. He has a winner on his hands.
