<div style="clear: both" />Another reason to like JWZ - he is a Bill Hicks fan too [by the looks of things](http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/486553.html).

The good always die young. Saw him live once when he played Dublin about a year before he died. He was on his anti-smoking kick at that stage (too late obviously) which to be honest wasn't half as funny as his pro-smoking rants. "Non-Smokers die.........every day".

Painful irony.

Excuse me whilst I giggle for a few minutes as I remember:

"Goat Boy"
"Kind of like going up to Jackie Onassis with a rifle pendant on, you know"
"Dinosaur fossils? God put those there to test our faith."

And the one I think of most often when I encounter idiots:

"what you readin for?"
