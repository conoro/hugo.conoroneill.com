You can say what you like about Top Gear but I can't stop myself loving it. It is silly, childish and predictable but it is one of the few programmes I look forward to in the week.

Sadly, I just heard that Richard Hammond [was critically injured in a crash](http://uk.news.yahoo.com/20092006/140/top-gear-star-seriously-hurt-crash.html)&nbsp;in a jet car doing upwards of 280 MPH! Fingers crossed that he recovers.
