I see Apple have announced a new product&nbsp;allows consumers to manage and playback their digital-media files on their televisions.

They've called it the iTV. Sadly for UK purchasers, this means that it'll only be capable of playing Corrie, Heartbeat, Celebrity Love Island and repeats of Crossroads.
