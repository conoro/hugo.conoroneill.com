We're playing around with some stuff on [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com) and we need as many translations as possible for the word "review" in the sense of "a review of a movie" or "a review of a restaurant". 

Ideally it should be a generic word that works in most situations. It would also be better if the words did not have accented characters (I'll explain that in a later post) and they must be in latin alphabet. We would like to get as many languages as possible but at the very least:

*   German (bericht?, meinung?)
*   French (revue? critique?)
*   Spanish (revision?)
*   Italian (rassegna?)
*   Portuguese
*   Danish
*   Dutch
*   Swedish
*   Norwegian
*   Finnish (viesti)
*   Estonian
*   Russian
*   Latvian
*   Lithuanian
*   Polish
*   Hungarian
*   Greek

Feel free to suggest others. Just use the comments box on this post to provide the words so that there can be discussion on them.
