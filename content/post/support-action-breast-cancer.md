I should have posted this weeks ago but I've been a wee bit busy. Our friends Haydn and Roos let me know about an event that is on October 29th in The Brogan Inn from 8pm to 10pm.

"It Must be the Music" is a night of Musical entertainment in aid of Action Breast Cancer, brought to you by Laoise O'Hanlon, joined by a variety of Cork women singers, including Kay Deering, Jamie Harper Kingston, Roos Demol, Bernie Harrington, Sinead Tracey, Jenny Bradley and Molly Lynch.

The accompanist is Deirdre Long and the MC is Ciarán Bermingham

Tickets are only €15 and are available from Roos on 086-8508548 or An Tobairín on South Main Street, Bandon.

Lots of discussion about it [over on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=161806457163827) if you want to know more.
