Poor Ois√≠n is terribly unlucky with his front teeth. When he was 2-ish he fell off a changing table and impacted one of his front teeth up into the bone and split the lip and gum. Nothing could be done except let it heal. That tooth was much shorter than the other one until yesterday. Then yesterday evening, he fell off a stool and did a repeat performance, this time knocking out his other tooth and making a mush of his upper lip again.

Once again, the advice from the doc was to do nothing and let it heal. He rang the dental hospital and they concurred particularly considering they are his baby teeth.

But we are worried about the full teeth and what the likelihood is that they'll come down ok. Anyone else have kids where this happened? I'd hate for the poor mite to have to get implants at an early age. I know too many people with those already.

I hope he gets something nice in town with Catherine today. The tooth fairy gave him a tenner cos she felt so sorry for him.
