This is another type of post that can be done with the Structured Blogging Plugin. In this case, it is the very common "list of links" post that many people put on their blogs. They are usually "interesting" links but not interesting enough to warrant a separate topic each.

Here I am just listing a bunch of food blogs/sites whose RSS feed I am subscribed to.

Again, I have never used this before so the format of the output is unknown to me.
