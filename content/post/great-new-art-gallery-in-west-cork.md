Haydn Shaughnessy is opening [a new art gallery](http://www.galleryica.com/) in the Pink Elephant in Harbour View overlooking the sea. As its name suggests it is dedicated to Innovative Contemporary Art.

The official launch is on May 31st but you can see some of the exhibitors over at the web-site which is really beautifully designed. [Haydn has blogged it here](http://www.mediangler.com/2007/05/15/gallery-site-is-up/) and mentions that two of my favourite photo-bloggers, [Ryan](http://rymus.net/) and [Donncha](http://inphotos.org/) should be exhibiting there soon.

I love what Haydn is trying to do with the gallery - highlighting those who are trying push things forward and use new technologies and tools in art.

Great art in a breathtaking location, what more could you ask for?

You'll find it on the coast road from Kinsale to Clonakilty near Kilbrittain.
