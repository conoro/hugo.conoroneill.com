Finally, 5 years after registering conoroneill.com and just having it re-direct to geocities, eircom and blogspot (in that order), I am now properly hosted with PowWeb. The value for money they were offering made it an easy decision. The import of the Blogspot Blog went disasterously badly yesterday as I did it on the latest 1.5.2 version of Wordpress which the importer did not like. Tonight I reverted to 1.5.1.2, did the import and then did the upgrade and it all worked swimmingly. 

So the old blog at [http://conoro.blogspot.com/](http://conoro.blogspot.com/) is now for historical purposes only. Keep your ass over here. I'm still on a bog standard default Wordpress theme with links to nothing. I'll get a more reasonable L&F on it over the next week or so. For the 0.00000000025% of people who read this blog with an RSS Aggregator like Bloglines, please subscribe to the Feedburner feed at [http://feeds.feedburner.com/ConorsBlog](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ConorsBlog), rather than directly to the feeds on this site. Let me know if you spot any problems.
