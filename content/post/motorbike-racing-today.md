It's that time of year again where men in tight leather pants race up and down the Clon road at Old Chapel on bright yellow motorbikes :-)

We've gone down for a look a couple of times over the years and it is genuinely a very exciting event. Noise, burning rubber, unburnt fuel and fabulous bikes. My kids think it's fantastic and hopefully the baby won't screech this time.

Now if only the rain would hold off so we don't have any accidents.
