It was an interesting bit of fun but I don't think the daily Tweet digest was a great addition to this blog. However, if you are still interested in the Tweets themselves, you can subscribe [via RSS to the feed here](http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/795100.atom). I may set up a separate simple blog which does the daily digest. If I do, I'll pop a link here.
