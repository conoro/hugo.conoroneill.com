We are spending two weeks in Clon whilst our kitchen gets rebuilt and decided to treat ourselves to an Indian takeaway on the first night. A bit of googling revealed that there was a new place called [Mirch Masala](https://www.mirchmasalacork.com/), so I loaded up their website on my phone and my jaw hit the floor as I started browsing the menu.

The range of vegan and vegetarian options is almost beyond belief. On our trip to London last summer I could not find any Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi restaurant near Shoreditch with an extensive vegan menu. Dishoom came closest. So to find a local West Cork dine-in and takeaway Indian offering this many dishes is shocking.

I'm also a bit stunned the Irish Veganorati on Instagram have not been talking about this *all the time*. They should be shouting it from the rooftops. Honestly, if you're within an hour (or even more) of Clonakilty and you're vegan or vegetarian, you should make the journey.

The other thing to love about them is that all of the bog-standard Anglo-Irish-Indian-Pakistani-Bangladeshi dishes are there but they are are well down the page. You'd be much better off trying all the other fantastic dishes they offer instead of the same-old same-old.

Pretty much everything has the option to be vegan including the naans and the raita!

I really enjoyed my chickpea curry (Amritsari Chole) and my wife loved her vegan kofta curry. The naans tasted freshly made with tons of garlic and fresh coriander. The sweet potato fries were delish too.

It's such a pleasure to see forward-thinking businesses like this settting up in semi-rural Ireland. I also just learned about [Budds](http://budds.ie/) in Ballydehob and will be making a trip to check out their vegan options too. Compare that to a new local "NYC-inspired" burger joint that opened recently and doesn't even offer the classic chipper salad burger, let alone a proper veggie/vegan option. 6 square inches in the freezer and an open mind is all they need to join the 21st century.

Oh and meat-eaters, fear not, Mirch Masala has a full menu for you too. You poor darlings with everything everywhere being vegan in January ðŸ˜‰

Finally, props to them for the cool webapp they are using for ordering, as it has live status updates and worked seamlessly. No need to pay any third-party fees.
