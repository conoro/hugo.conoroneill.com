We went on our summer holidays to Barley Cove for 11 years in a row as kids. On several of those years we went to Garnish Island via Glengarrif. That was as far as I ever got on the Beara peninsula until last week when I visited Adrigole. I honestly can't put into words how beautiful it is down there. If I was American I'd call it God's country. Perfect views on a perfect day made me want to immediately retire and move there.

I also discovered that there is a blog been written down there by [Gail and the West Cork Sailing team](http://www.westcorksailing.blogspot.com/). Now I've never been into sailing or boats but this could get me interested. Lots of reports from the vessels themselves along with lovely photos. I'm now subscribed.
