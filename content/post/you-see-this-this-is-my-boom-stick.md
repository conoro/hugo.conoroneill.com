<div style="clear:both;"></div>[Great article and interview on Salon](http://www.salon.com/books/int/2005/07/14/campbell/index.html?source=RSS) about Bruce Campbell and his new book, ["Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way"](http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0312312601). You just can't help liking the man. Does his own thing and is obviously enjoying every minute. B-List my bum.

Still haven't got my hands on [Bubba Ho-Tep](http://www.bubbahotep.com/).

A useful phrase for many an awkward situation ["Yo, she-bitch! Let's go!"](http://www.garnersclassics.com/qarmdrk.htm)
