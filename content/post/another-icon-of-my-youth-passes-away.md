Most of them may have been crap but I cannot deny loving nearly everything [Aaron Spelling](http://uk.news.yahoo.com/24062006/325/producer-aaron-spelling-dies.html) made. 

Here are just a few:

*   Beverly Hills 90210

*   Melrose Place

*   Dynasty

*   Fantasy Island
*   Starsky
and Hutch
*   Hart to Hart
*   Charlie's Angels
*   TJ Hooker

*   Burke's Law

He'll be missed. Along with Glen A Larson, I think he defined what I watched on TV as a kid.
