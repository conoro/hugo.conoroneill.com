If you are not a geek, stop reading now. Factory Joe (aka Chris Messina) [did a Tweet earlier](http://twitter.com/factoryjoe/statuses/43742432) pointing to [a theme for Wordpress](http://blog.elinc.ca/rod/). I just checked it out. I am so in awe of this person. 

It is a Commodore 64 Command Line Interface to a blog.

Try typing last, next, current, help or cat

Someone somewhere please please do a ZX Spectrum version of this.

UPDATE 1: Ach, just realised Chris must have seen it on [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/04/28/turn_wordpress_blogs.html).
