The savage at the wheel of 90-L-1944 came within a hair's breadth of killing me, all my children, my mother in law, all of those in an oncoming vehicle and everyone in his own vehicle 10 minutes ago.

This cretin who clearly rates his own life as worthless carried out a suicidal overtaking manouvre of my car just before Bandon with a stream of cars bearing down on us. If I hadn't seen him in my side mirror and swerved into the road margin at the last second, there would have been a fatal three car collision.

This imbecile then immediately got stuck in 20 MPH town traffic.

If you spot this old grey Honda Prelude in West Cork, give it a wide berth, he may try to kill you too.

You may ask why I didn't call the police. Do you think they would have done anything?
