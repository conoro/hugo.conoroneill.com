My first employer was S3, who are 90% owned by Philips in The Netherlands. As a result,I spent quite a bit of time in Eindhoven, where the HQ is based. Big hello to the Eindhoven posse (Mark)!

[The Inquirer has an short article](http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=28163) on the death of the son of the founder of Philips at the age of 100\. They mention what he was in charge of in his heyday. The same name was on a giant sign which you passed in the train on the way into the city from Amsterdam. I never needed anyone to translate it for me:

Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken

Just a perfect word.
