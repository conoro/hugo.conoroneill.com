Any country brave enough to have a hobbit and a garden gnome as their backing singers deserves to win. 

To be fair to <strike>Daniel O'Donnell</strike> Brian Kennedy, he did allow his grandad to be one of his backing singers. His song "Bacardi and Coke please Mafanwy" really pulled at the heartstrings like a bad case of angina. 

The best aspect of his performance was that he decided to keep his thighs covered, a decision I wish many of the other performers had also made.

Now Eurovision, later Big Brother. Would they not think of merging the two programmes and put all the bands into a small sealed house with some guns and knives. Last (wo)man standing and still singing is the winner. I can only dream.

UPDATE 1: I take it all back, Finland to win! The Albanian hobbits must surely be hiding from the "never smalltalk a Finn" Orcs. Next year they'll all be dressed like that.
