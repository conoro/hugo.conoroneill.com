Every once in a while I still need to receive a fax. I continue to be surprised by the number of people who don't know that you don't need a fax machine to do this. 

If you are on Vodafone, make sure you have set up a Vodafone email account and then just give out your mobile number preceded with a 5 as your fax number i.e. +353-87-5NNNNNNN. The fax is then sent to a special folder on Vodafone email and you get an SMS to say it is there. You can then logon and download the fax as a picture which you can print out.

If memory serves, the alternative is that you call your voicemail and it gives you the option to forward the fax to another fax machine of your choosing.
