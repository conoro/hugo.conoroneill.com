There is a wonderful bunch of things planned in Cork as part of [Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.ie/) which will hopefully increase the interest in science amongst kids. The target audience is 10-16 year olds but I'm sure we'll drag our 8 year old along to some of it.

It is on from 11th Nov to 18th Nov in various locations around the city. I believe the HQ is City Hall and local tech companies will have stands there. Many of the events will be in UCC.

Check out the web-site [for a full list](http://www.scienceweek.ie/sw2007/results.asp?sregion=Cork&saudcat=%25&) of what is happening and make sure to book the ones that require it.

I'd like to go to "It's Elemental! Role of elements in our everyday life".
