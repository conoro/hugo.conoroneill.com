We're just playing around with a few ideas on a site called [Jaiku](http://conoro.jaiku.com/) this morning (they were bought by Google a few months back). The idea is that you can have discussion channels on particular topics like technology, politics, Bandon GAA, whatever. What makes it (and other great sites like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/conoro)) so powerful is that you can interact with it entirely through SMS on your phone.

So this morning I created two non-techie ones that I thought might appeal to my more foodie readers. The first is [#recipes](http://jaiku.com/channel/recipes) and the second is [#gardening](http://jaiku.com/channel/gardening). In both cases the idea was that they could be used for requesting advice (in addition to general chitchat).

The #recipes one was suggested by [Michael Kiely](http://festoon.jaiku.com/) and he thought it would be great if you were out shopping and spotted an ingredient and wanted suggestions for mini-recipes so you'd know what else to buy whilst you were there. A quick SMS, a bit more shopping and you might get some suggestions back by SMS.

I thought of the #gardening one and it could also be used in a similar way to #recipes when in a Garden Centre and wondering e.g. is X worth buying, it Y over-priced etc.

Of course you can use both channels on the web too (and obviously type a lot more than 140 characters!).

There are two flies in the ointment. The first is that it'll need more people on these channels to make them work and the second is that joining Jaiku is officially closed at the minute. Both can be solved in one fell swoop by heading over to [Jaiku Invites](http://jaikuinvites.com/), setup by [Ciar√°n Rooney](http://www.weeno.ie/) and requesting an invite to join.

Give it a go. It's just a bit of fun and I've already had two suggestions on how to cook the fennel bulbs I bought on a whim in Lidl during the week. Any problems using it, just pop a comment here.
