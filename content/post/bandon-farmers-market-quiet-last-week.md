I finally made it down to the market last week after missing three in a row. A lot of the usual stalls were missing presumably due to holidays etc and&nbsp;it was a quick dash and grab by Fionn, Sib√©al and I. 

More stunning steaks from Aherns, some interesting and tasty Portuguese salt from Ummera, some veg from the veg man and some brot from the&nbsp;&nbsp;Baking Emporium in Dunmanway and I was done.

It struck me that it may be worthwhile for the organisers to do a few surveys at the market. I'd love to know some facts like:

*   Are you very local, local, passing through or a tourist?
*   Is this your first visit?
*   How many times have you been here?
*   Are you regular?
*   Will you be back?
*   What do you buy?
*   What are you favourite aspects of the market?
*   What are your least favourite aspects?
*   What is it missing?
*   How often would you like to see the market happen? 

For me, I think the market is superb but there is a definite tendency to the high end of things. I would love to see more basic produce suppliers there like the veg man but selling at supermarket cost or below (due to the lack of a middleman).

I'll post the next set of dates for the market when I find them out. I didn't know a few of the recent ones were happening until the day before. All in all it has been a great few months for the market and I see it getting better and better.
