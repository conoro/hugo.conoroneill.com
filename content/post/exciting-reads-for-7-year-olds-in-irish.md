Oscar is a bright kid who loves to read. His favourite novel is Le Catalogue d'Argos. In fact he loves the Horrid Henry series (and other similar ones). The only subject he is weak in is, surprise surprise, Irish. Unlike Oisín and Sibéal, he never went to Naoinra so started on it cold in junior infants. We're hoping to get him into Irish as a bit of a challenge but the books have to engage him.

Anyone out there have recommendations for good exciting reads in Irish for kids aged around 7? [Catherine found this site](http://www.obrien.ie/Category46.cfm) but most of those descriptions sound a bit boring e.g. where is Mamo's tooth? Does something old fashioned like the equivalent of The Secret Seven or Famous Five even exist in Irish?
