The [LouderVoice](http://business.loudervoice.com/) customer reviews system for business has moved into high-gear in 2009\. Clients are deploying our EasyReview widget on their e-commerce sites every week. Our first US customer will go live this month along with many more Irish sites. Our second UK site will go live early in the new year.

The most recent research by Internet Retailer tells you everything you need to know about how important reviews are to businesses.

In order to expand the operational bandwidth of the company and aggressively pursue our channel partner strategy, we are raising finance through the tax-efficient Business Expansion Scheme (BES). Argolon Solutions, the company behind LouderVoice, is fully Revenue approved for BES and we will be issuing our investor pack in the coming week.

If you are interested in finding out more and receiving a copy of the investor pack, please contact Conor O'Neill on +353-23-8878257 or conor AT loudervoice DOT com.
