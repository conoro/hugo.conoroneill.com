I was enraged on Thursday whilst listening to the latest [Restaurant Guys' podcast](http://www.restaurantguysradio.com/sle/rg/content/shows/index.asp?show_id=478). They were interviewing a New York restaurateur who is being picketed by fois gras protestors. These ugg-boot-wearing idiots think they can intimidate a small business owner and effectively put him out of business. These cowards don't have the balls to go after large fast-food chains who sell industrially produced chicken and figure they'll go for easy marks instead.

Unfortunately for these hypocrites, this restaurant owner is Irish and (like the rest of us) he doesn't like people telling him what to do. I was then thrilled to discover who he was. The restaurant is [Knife + Fork](http://www.knife-fork-nyc.com/) and he is Damien Brasel. He was made head chef in Peacock Alley in Dublin at the age of 20! Two of my top ten meals of all time were in Peacock Alley in its heyday before it all went pear-shaped.

His response to these lazy cause-of-the-week nitwits? Put a fois gras tasting menu on! The outcome? His business has improved. Result :-)

If you are in New York and wondering where to eat, can I recommend you try [Knife + Fork](http://bit.ly/VJPCY)? Bring some chicken nuggets with you to throw at the wastes-of-oxygen picketing outside at the weekend.
