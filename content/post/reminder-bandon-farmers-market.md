### Second Bandon Farmer's Market

Sat, 15 Apr 2006 at 10:00 AM<

The Old Market Garden, Bandon, Co Cork, Ireland

Just a quick reminder that the second Bandon Farmer's is on Easter Saturday. I can't recommend it highly enough.Wonderful produce, really friendly people.

Location is the carpark of the [old SuperValu, Old Mace, New Spar](http://local.live.com/?v=2&sp=aN.51.743760_-8.738509_Bandon%20Farmer%27s%20Market_Mace%20Car%20Park).

I'm looking forward to checking out all the stalls I missed the last time.
