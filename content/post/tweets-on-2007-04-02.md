*   Steve Jobs, Damian Thorn, EMI, Thorn-EMI. Oh no, the apocalypse is upon us. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/17683451)
*   Ulster Bank Online Business Banking still stuck on IE4+ or Netscape 4.7\. This level of incompetence shouldn't be allowed near the web. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/17711371)
*   @PaulWalsh - Ulster Bank has a FAQ page an accessibility. Unfortunately it's not *cough* very accessible :-) [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/17788391)
*   EuroVPS DNS giving me gyp. Normally expect that to work out of the box without tweaking. Need an Ops guy. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/17805281)
*   Thought I had tons of baby leaf lettuce seeds. Don't. So planted cos, rocket and carrots. Saladini and scallions tomorrow. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/17866271)
*   @donncha - I tried Digging your InPhotos SEO post too and they can't access the URL. DNS problem at their end? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/17868511)
*   Just registered corkopencoffee.com and corkopencoffee.org. Pointing them both to the upcoming page for now [http://upcoming.org/group/2849/](http://upcoming.org/group/2849/) [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/17984801)

*   Windows Media player can't play MP4s and Quicktime is a disaster on Windows. Trying Democracy player now [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/17986041)
*   So much for that idea. I click on anything in Democracy player and it says "action is not a registered protocol". Handy, thanks. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/17988361)
*   Did the same moron design all DIY web-sites like BandQ, Woodies, Atalntic? Try searching for cuprinol. Feels like 1995\. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/18002791)
