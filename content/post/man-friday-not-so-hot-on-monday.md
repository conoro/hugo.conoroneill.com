I was recently out on a business dinner with some Dutch customers to "Man Fridays" in Kinsale. This appears to be one of the most famous restaurants in Kinsale and is nestled in a fabulous location overlooking the harbour. Parking in that part of Kinsale was, as ever, a nightmare. I eventually strapped two dinghys to my car and moored it off the promenade.

Overall I was very disappointed with the food but the Dutch guys loved it, so go figure. It is strictly old-school with very heavy-handed dishes and massive portions. But it was jammed on a Monday night in October so they clearly know their clientele.

One of the guys rated his creme brulee as the best he has ever eaten. But then this is from a race of people who's favourite snack is [kroket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroket). Imagine a potato croquette but filled with a puree of meat-offcuts.  Imagine a giant big......no, forget that, it'll put you off your tea. 

They always slather them in mustard, presumably to kill both the taste and the smell.

It looks a little bit like this:

So in summary; Man Friday's - the best restaurant for kroket lovers in Ireland. 

If you do visit the Netherlands, don't forget to ask "Zijn er ook bitterballen?".
