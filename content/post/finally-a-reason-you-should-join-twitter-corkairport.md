I know I said I'd keep most of the tech over on [conoroneill.net](http://conoroneill.net/) but I had to share this with a wider audience. If you've read this blog over the past few years, you'll have seen me banging on about Twitter a lot (particularly way back in 2007). The bulk of the population remains to be convinced of its utility so my usual answer to people wondering why they should join is that it's the ultimate news source. Watching stories as they break without having to rely on those jobsworths in RTE News (the bailout coverage was their worst day's work in 84 years) still excites me.

But now I have an even better reason for Munster residents to sign-up. [Cork Airport is now on Twitter](http://twitter.com/corkairport) and they are doing an absolutely amazing job. Fully up-to-the-minute information on delays, cancellations, closures and more. No more hoping the web-site has been updated or sitting on hold trying to find out if your flight is leaving on-time. If you travel much through the airport, join Twitter now and follow even that one account.
