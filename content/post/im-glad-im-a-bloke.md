<div style="clear:both;"></div>We are now 23 hours and 35 minutes away from Catherine being induced in the Bons. We still haven't figured out if it is inducement or induction and we are having last minute hesitations about the name we have picked for him. We had decided on Cavan O'Neill but my mother objected and thought we should compromise on Navan O'Neill. 

Babba was 9lbs last week. I don't even want to think what weight he is now. We have the Epi booked for insertion in the car park (no point in wasting time) and this time we have a pregnancy TENS machine. Turns out the one we used for Oscar was for sore knees. Might explain Catherine's slight discomfort during his delivery.....

Just as with the DeepImpact mission to Tempel 1, we will be broadcasting as-it-happens footage from the delivery room via Nokia Crap-Cam.

The next Blog posting will probably be a picture of the 87th Sudoku puzzle that Catherine has completed whilst wating for Baby Anakin to arrive.
