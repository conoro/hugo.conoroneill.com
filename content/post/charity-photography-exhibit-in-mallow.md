Via [Donncha](http://ocaoimh.ie/2007/09/06/charity-photography-exhibit-starts-today/) - Mallow Camera Club will be exhibiting a number of photos in Mallow Town Library for three weeks starting yesterday.

One of the Club’s members, Sean Riordan, is heading out to South Africa shortly as part of a group from the Niall Mellon Township Trust helping to build homes for the poor in that country. All the photos on exhibit will be for sale with all profits going to help fund Sean’s trip and the good work he’ll do in November.

This is a very worthy cause so if you can make it at all, please head up there and buy some pictures.
