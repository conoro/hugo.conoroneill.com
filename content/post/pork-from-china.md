I set up Google Analytics and AdSense on this web-site for no real reason other than messin. Watching the ads that appear could become a full-time hobby. 

Most of them are as expected - "Holidays in Donegal or Galway". I've had a few "buy sausages and herbs from us". But one made me do a click-thru on my own site: "Buy Pork". 

Hmm interesting. Then I read the detail of the site a little closer, "Buy Pork from China"!

Ye know, I'd almost be tempted by "Frozen Pork Sides Origined in Shandong province, China with high quality". I don't know if I could have a communist in the house tho.
