Update 19/09/2005: I had left out a few steps on this originally, so I'm re-publishing.

I have a recipe for Meatballs with Tomato Sauce which is based mainly on Sophie Grigson's recipe in her  Meat Course  Book. That is one of the best Cookbooks of the past few years but sadly is out of print now. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's  River Cottage Meat Book  is a pretty good alternative for carnivores. My family rave about this meal when I cook it and I have to admit to being partial to it myself. All of the amounts are approximate (use your judgement).

For the Meatballs:
2 lbs minced beef
1 lb sausages
3 tbs milk
1 egg
2 slices white pan (crusts removed)
parsley to taste  (couple of tbs chopped)
6 cloves garlic minced (or more if you like)

For the sauce:
5 cans plum tomatoes
basil to taste (loads!)
parsley to taste (couple of tbs chopped)
3 cloves garlic minced (or more if you like)
1 tbs red wine vinegar

Extra Virgin Olive Oil (I prefer Filippo Berrio)

To make the sauce:
Cover the bottom of a medium pan with the oil and put on medium heat
Add 3 cloves of&nbsp; the garlic. Cook gently for a few moments but do not let it get brown
Add all of the tomatoes
Cook down gently for 20-30 mins breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon
Add parsley about half way
When it is well broken down, add red wine vinegar
cook a few minutes more
Check acidity - add sugar to taste to soften it. This varies with every can of tomatoes.

Meanwhile

To make the meatballs:
Add bread to milk in a bowl and soak for a few mins
Peel sausages (or use sausagemeat) and add to a large bowl
Add minced beef, soaked bread and egg
Add the rest of the garlic
Add a good pile of parsley
Season well with salt and pepper
If you are very anal, cook a bit of this mix in a pan, check the seasoning and adjust.
Mix together very well by hand
Make the balls from this to whatever size you like (golf-ball is a good compromise).
Add oil to a frying pan and apply medium to high heat
Brown the meatballs well in batches so that they are well cooked on the outside.
Do not over-fill the pan or the meatballs will not get a nice dark colour
Add cooked meatballs to the tomato sauce and cook for another fifteen minutes or so.
Add water if sauce has gone too thick   
A few minutes before the end, add tons of basil and then add salt/pepper to taste.

Serve with spaghetti and loads of freshly grated parmesan.

Notes:
There are a million tomato sauce recipes. Use whatever you prefer e.g. add onion or oregano or red wine or whatever. I just like this simple one in this case.

I'm sure I've forgotten something above so don't blame me if it is kak.
