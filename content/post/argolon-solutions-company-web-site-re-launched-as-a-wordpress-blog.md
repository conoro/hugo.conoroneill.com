<div style="clear:both;"></div>We are very happy to announce our early alpha re-launch of our company web-site as a Wordpress blog. We hope that releasing before completion will accelerate it's development. The main point of re-structuring as a blog is to try and create a community forum for discussing Enterprise Systems, in particular Enterprise Storage Software and Systems. Ideally many of those working in the Irish divisions of storage companies such as EMC, Dell, StorageTek, SUN etc will take advantage of the site and put an Irish spin on the discussions. Please feel free to make suggestions. It is still a work in progress and we hope to make major improvements over the next few weeks.
