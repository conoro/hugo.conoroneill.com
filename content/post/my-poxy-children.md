Is is possible to get psychosomatic Chicken Pox? I think I may have it, I've been scratching for days. 

Shibs got the pox two weeks ago and right on schedule the three boys got it yesterday. The baby is crucified with spots on his eyelids, lips and all over his head. Ois has a bad patch on his foot but is ok, Osc was flattened. I hope my mother was right about me having it as a kid. Unshaven, sweaty and pox-ridden does not a good business impression make.

And now, back to your dinner.
