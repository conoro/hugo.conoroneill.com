I'm sure you bought a USB stick or portable harddisk with the best intentions in the world but how often do you actually backup irreplaceable files? How would you feel if those wedding pictures disappeared in a puff of smoke?

That's why I consider online backup a must-have. I only recommend two services and the one at the top of my list is [PutPlace](http://www.putplace.com/). This low-cost solution by an Irish company is simple to set-up and then you just forget about it. All of your important files are kept safe on Amazon's amazing storage system S3 and you can recover what you need with a few clicks.

The important thing about PutPlace is that it for consumers. So whilst [HP gives up and shutters Upline](http://blog.putplace.com/2009/02/26/putplace-invites-hp-upline-users-to-switch/), PutPlace goes from strength to strength.

Backup is boring but the day you lose those files is the day you wish you'd signed up for [PutPlace](http://www.putplace.com/). Â My buddy Joe, the founder, will even give you 3 months free. Just use the discount code "joe"!
