What started off as [a throwaway comment](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/920049669) on Twitter today led me to one of the most inspirational talks I have seen since Hans Rosling at Le Web.

Sir Ken Robinson [talks at TED](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html) about how the current education system kills creativity and continues to take the 19th Century approach of generating people trained for industry.

It's 20 minutes long and I encourage you to watch every minute. It isn't just thought provoking, it is also hilarious.
