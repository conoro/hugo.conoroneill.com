He got rid of The Tulip and is keeping The Black Widow! My only recollection of her over the entire series is swigging champagne in Top Shop. I have to hand it to her, she has slyed her way through to the end. Another dark horse like Tim last year? I hope not. But at least my fave, The Badger, got through.

Next week is must see TV.
