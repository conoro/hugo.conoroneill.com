This would be funny if over 2000 people hadn't been murdered by terrorists in the past thirty five years on this island.

I was just reading the latest edition of my local Bandon Opinion and saw an ad by Sinn Fein Bandon encouraging people to wear the Easter Lily.

Let me just quote the important bit: "combining the green, white and saffron of our national flag". Green......White.....SAFFRON? Which national flag are these cretins referring to? That of Tuvalu maybe or Micronesia or maybe Latvia?

Obviously Sinn Fein is now run by middle class foodies who like nothing better than a delicate saffron flavoured risotto.

Just when you think they are getting a clue, you are reminded of what you are dealing with.
