Hard to believe. Little did I think, this day 10 years ago, that I'd still be blogging away like fury. I originally started with Blogspot as I wasn't keeping my Geocities home page up to date. It was not an auspicious start:

And didn't exactly take off like a rocket with only 3 posts in 2001!

2005 was the year I really got going when I moved from Blogspot to Wordpress. Luckily I managed to import everything in the move.

Looking across various blogs, it looks like I've written the following in ten years:

*   conoroneill.com: 765 posts
*   argolon.com: 341 posts
*   loudervoice.com: 199 posts
*   web2ireland.org: 288 posts
*   conoroneill.net: 345
*   plus a bunch more scattered amongst random shortlived blogs
Let's call it a nice round 2000 posts. I guess real writers would consider that a reasonable body of work.

Here's hoping I keep it going for another 10 years!
