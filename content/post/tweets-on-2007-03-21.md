*   Well Yahoo Pipes has fried my brain so it's bed-time. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10249521)
*   Lots of offers to do our CSS+XHTML work. Hurrah. Blogger publishing working (but messy). Figured out regexes in Yahoo pipes too. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10390971)
*   Casio returned watch for fourth time rather than replacing it. Different fix this time. I wonder how long it'll last before screwing up? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10408631)
*   Off to Farran to talk to a dev. Back around lunch-time. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10410391)
*   Not convinced by phonics/fonics. 5-year old just did his ABCs as Ah Buh Cuh Duh Eh Fuh Guh. Red Book with black dots worked for me. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10504991)
*   Finally! Ballincollig/Watergrasshill/Carrigtwohill dual-carriageways up to 120kph and Old Chapel down to 50kph. Key is "appropriate speed". [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10535771)
*   Watching classic Curb "I'm surprised Hitler didn't just kill all the toupee people". Spoken like a true fellow slaphead. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10642751)
*   W00t, just spotted this via Alex King. [http://www.tinytwitter.com/](http://www.tinytwitter.com/) Twitter app for mobile phone. No more bazillion SMSes. Checking now. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10644491)
*   For N70, jad file no good. Open in notepad to get URL of jar. Or directly this: [http://tinyurl.com/37hgoy](http://tinyurl.com/37hgoy) [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10653711)
*   Feedburner now enabled on web2ireland. Back to another session with Yahoo Pipes. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10683391)
*   The Yahoo Pipes discussion board seems to have no facility to subscribe to a thread via RSS or otherwise. Cmon it's 2007 already. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10714591)
*   No CDATA or markup allowed in pipes regexes due to bug. Damn, there goes that cunning plan until they fix it. May have to write real code! [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10718751)
