<div style="clear:both;"></div>A week in Massachusetts from 9th-14th. Staying in Framingham, working in Hopkinton. I was in Boston once in 1996 whilst I was working in Silicon Valley and I met up with Catherine there. Great place. Felt small even tho it wasn't. Brass Monkey weather in November. Looks like it isn't too cold there now. I've already Google Mapped my way from the hotel to CompUSA, Toys R Us, Best Buy and Baby Gap. A couple of forays to Walgreens and maybe a sports store and I'll be sated for another six months.
