I was all excited for 20 minutes today. [Nokia have released a free tool](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/22/nokia_firmware_diy/) to enable you to upgrade your own phone firmware. 

I grabbed the one for the N70, backed up the phone, installed the software and waited for it to analyse my phone. Result? I have the latest available Vodafone branded firmware so no upgrade is possible. 

The Voda numbnuts haven't released an upgrade since last September! Meanwhile I have a good phone which would be far far better with the improved firmware. And they all wonder why they have no customer loyalty.&nbsp;

Anyone know the name of a good dodgy phone unlocker in Munster?
