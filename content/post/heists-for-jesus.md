<div style="clear:both;"></div>I shouldn't laugh, I really shouldn't, but I'm pretty sure the only Baptist church in Bandon is the one just near our house. 

[Baptist pastor charged over bank robbery](http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0806/cork.html?rss)

If only we'd gone to his coffee morning, this could all have been avoided.

The fact that the BOI Bank Manager lives beside the Baptist Church too sends this story into the realms of the completely bizarre.

UPDATE 15/11/2005: They gave the poor sod [a suspended sentence](http://www.breakingnews.ie/2005/11/14/story230178.html). Ye have to feel sorry for him. But, to be honest, it doesn't stop it being funny. All I can picture in my head is Woody Allen arguing with the bank clerk about whether his note says "I have a gub" or "I have a gun".
