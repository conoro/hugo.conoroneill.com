Got an email from Cork GreenMap telling me about a new feasibility study that Cork City Council are doing in the area of Car Sharing.

> Cork City Council is considering the feasibility of the setting up of a car-sharing service – also called “car club” in the UK – in Cork City:

> What is car-sharing?
> Car-sharing in urban areas is a cost-effective alternative to owning your own car. It allows people access to a car when they need it, from a place near their home or workplace. The car can be used for short trips lasting as little as an hour or booked for a few days. You only pay for the hours you keep the car and the distance you drive. NB: the term “car-sharing” is also used to designate the sharing of a ride.
> 
> Who can be members of a car-sharing club?
> Members of a car club can be both individuals who don’t need a car on a daily basis and companies/organisations looking for mobility solutions to tackle parking, traffic or car-pooling issues on their site in Cork City.
> 
> What are the advantages of car-sharing?
> The advantages of car-sharing are numerous: 
> 
> *   Affordable: just pay for the time the car is in use and the distance driven
> *   Reserved parking: cars are conveniently located in reserved places close to where you live or work
> *   Flexible: book a car for as little as an hour, on-line or calling a booking centre
> *   Easy to use: after registration you just book it, jump in the car and drive away
> *   Planet-friendly: car-sharing globally reduces parking pressure and car use, helping to combat pollution and climate change
> 
> Tell us what you think! 
> 
> A feasibility study is being carried out on behalf of Cork City Council and a public consultation stage is now on track to assess the potential market of such a service as well as to define the best locations of a car club in the city centre.

Looks like Cork is turning into the San Fran of Ireland in more ways than one! I hope this idea takes off.
