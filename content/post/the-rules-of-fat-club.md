Pat Phelan's [recent post about losing weight](http://patphelan.net/no-seriously-im-not-pregnant/) and giving up ciggies highlighted that we all stand a better chance of success if we do some online group supoort of each other via Twitter/Facebook. The bruv in law came up with Fat Club. So here we go:

#1 - The first rule of Fat Club is, you must talk all the time about Fat Club online.

#2 - The second rule of Fat Club is, you MUST TALK about Fat Club online.

#3 - If someone says stop, goes limp or taps out, the de-fatting has just begun.

#4 - Lots of guys fighting fat.

#5 - One kilo at a time.

#6 - Baggy shirts, running shoes.

#7 - De-fatting will go on as long as it has to.

#8 - Every night at Fat Club, you have to weigh yourself and Tweet/Facebook it

I'm in. Anyone else?
