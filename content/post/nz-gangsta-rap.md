I just spotted this over at the [Signal vs Noise blog](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/its_business_time.php). Brilliant Kiwi comedy duo called [The Conchords](http://www.conchords.net/video.html). [Hiphopopotamus vs. Rhymenoceros](http://www.conchords.net/video/hiphopmed.mov) is definitely the best of them.
