Well done to Gavin Sheridan and the crew at [The Story](http://thestory.ie/). They took NAMA's pathetic PDF release of the properties it owns, extracted the data into the fantastic Google Fusion Tables and then [mapped the results](http://thestory.ie/2011/07/30/nama-enforcement-properties-mapped) into Google Maps.

Go on, you know you won't be able to help yourself. I immediately zoomed into Bandon to see what was there. Surprisingly few properties actually.

[Head on over to the site](http://thestory.ie/2011/07/30/nama-enforcement-properties-mapped/) and click on any dot of interest to see what property it is. Some of the locations will be off as they rely on Google accurately converting text addresses to lat/long. Of course if we had a Post Code system in Ireland, we wouldn't have that problem. What's the current prediction for that? 2015?
