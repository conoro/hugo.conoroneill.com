This is probably the first and last time I'll ever post a clip from the Late Late Show. Despite Tubbs excruciating interviewing style, Sean O'Sullivan blew my socks off. From a family of 9 with a dead-beat Dad to huge success. He runs his current business, Avego, from Kinsale. We need more people like him talking about Engineering and Creativity together. If you want your children to create the future, nudge them in that direction.

13 minutes really just left me wanting more. Given that the Late Late cannot compete for "celebrity" guests with the UK chatshows, how about more time on fewer meatier guests like this from now on?
