<div style="clear: both" />For no discernable reason other than the fact that I can, this Blog is now also available via Feedburner.

I suppose a possible reason for people using that feed is that I can find out if anyone other than Mark and my wife actually reads reads this blog. The Atom feed is available here:

[Conor's Blog](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ConorsBlog)

And while I'm at it, I'll lash in a Technorati tag too. Yeah, I'm at a total loss too as to why this is useful in my case.
