Yoplait have recently completely changed the labels on their yoghurts. Our kids are now refusing to eat them "cos they are not the same". 

I'm willing to be that a huge percentage of yoghurt sales are for kids. Did any brand manager actually ask any kids what they thought? Any blip noticed in sales? Blip down, right? 

Sometimes, just sometimes, leaving things as they are is the smart thing to do.
