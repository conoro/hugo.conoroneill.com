[Margaret Jordan](http://twitter.com/margaretjordan) pointed out on Friday in Facebook that the [1911 Census data](http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/) is now online. Ever since, a bunch of us have been searching and learning. I've been looking up O'Neill, ONeill, Neill, Flynn, Meaney, Foley, Doran, Wall and Walls to see which of my ancestors I could identify and send them on to my Mum and Dad.

I was thrilled to find this record of my Granny Mary, her parents and siblings. The first thing that jumped out at me was that my Grandaunt Dora was born Hanora. I wonder when it changed?

The census covers all 32 countries (obviously) and if you have any interest in history at all, you'll spend hours digging into the data.
