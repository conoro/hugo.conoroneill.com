Bloody teenagers. All they do is sit around, playing video games, smoking, drinking cider and coming up with fantastic ideas like [TeenCamp](http://teencampireland.com).
> TeenCamp Ireland is a gathering of the techies/bloggers/fanboys age 13+ in Ireland to give talks, meet others, share ideas and have a laugh. TeenCamps are organised/planned/run by teens for other teens.
They are holding it in [Filmbase in Dublin](http://teencampireland.com/2008/12/18/tci-update/) on Jan 17th.

If you know anyone in this age group who fits the bill, let them know about it. I'd have cut my arm off with a rusty saw aged 15 in 1983 to attend something like this and swap ZX Spectrum programming tips.
