I still have the shakes and I don't think it's all drink related. Truly, madly, deeply stunned to win [Best Blog Post](http://awards.ie/blogawards/?p=139) at the awards last night. Thanks a million times over to all of you who voted for me. It was a bloody brilliant night overall and the highlight was Bernie refusing to take the "Best Contribution to the Irish Bloggersphere" award and giving it to Damien instead. A well deserved standing ovation ensued.

Damien manages to have that killer combination of idealism and pragmatism which enables him to come up with a constant stream of great ideas and then execute on them. Where most of us think "wouldn't it be great if **someone** did X" , Damien just thinks "let's do it".Â   Thanks Damien.

I was thrilled to meet tons of people whose blogs I read daily. In particular I loved running into [Sweary](http://arseendofireland.blogspot.com/), [FeeBee](http://2weekwait.blogspot.com/) and [Roos](http://www.onebreastless.com/). Sweary is just an awesome blogger and both FeeBee and Roos write what I consider to be extremely important blogs with the ability to profoundly impact peoples lives in a positive way by demystifying what they are going through. I'm genuinely disappointed that none of them got an award last night.

On the subject of Sweary, I hope I didn't bore the arse of TSG as I was polluted by the time I headed over to talk to them. I was very happy to hear that Tom out-danced me after I went to bed as I'm having flashbacks to some of my moves and they were not pretty.

Apologies to anyone who I talked drunken nonsense to, I'm nothing like that in real life ;-)

Well done to all the winners and all those who were shortlisted. Damn that was a good night even if I was in bed by midnight......I think.
