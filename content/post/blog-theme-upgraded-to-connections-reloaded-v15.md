This site runs on the Wordpress blogging platform and uses a "Theme" called Connections Reloaded. The theme defines the look and feel of the site. Ajay D'Souza, the creator of this great theme, has just released v1.5 and I have upgraded to that. So far I have spotted no problems and I like all of the improvements. Still have to get my head around these new Wordpress Widgets.
[Ajay's announcement with a list of changes is here](http://www.ajaydsouza.com/archives/2006/04/09/connections-reloaded-15/).
