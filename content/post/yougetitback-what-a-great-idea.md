I know they have been around for a bit but I just found out recently about [yougetitback.com](http://yougetitback.com/). It's one of those ideas that just makes you go "perfect!". And it is so simple. Sign up with them and pay €9.99 for two stickers which you can attach to valuables like mobile phones. The sticker has a telephone number, code and message about a reward to the finder if it is lost. The chances of it being returned in the case of loss are now far far higher. Bloody brilliant. The €9.99 will give you cover for the items for three years. Bargain.
