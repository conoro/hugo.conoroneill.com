<div style="clear:both;"></div>We have a job ad in this weeks [Irish Examiner](http://www.examiner.ie/) on Friday! This is very much the next phase of the company's development.

Due to even more demand for our services, we need both full-time and contract software developers with a background in Custom Database Application development, Java/C++/C# development, Enterprise Frameworks or Network Management software. As always, the work is based in Co Cork and all interested applicants should head on over to [www.argolon.com.](http://www.argolon.com)

This is a great opportunity for developers who like to be on the bleeding-edge of Enterprise software integration and want to get in early with a fast-growing company.
