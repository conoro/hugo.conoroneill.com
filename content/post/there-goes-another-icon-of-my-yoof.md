[Joe Barbera has died](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6191999.stm) aged 95\. I wonder how many re-runs he saw over the years? That man is responsible for a huge number of my favourite TV memories from childhood (and now with Boomerang, as an immature adult):

*   Tom and Jerry
*   The Flintstones
*   Scooby Doo
*   The Huckleberry Hound Show
*   The Yogi Bear Show
*   Quick Draw McGraw
*   Top Cat
*   Wacky Races
*   Banana Splits

And not forgetting the greatest cartoon ever: [Hong Kong Phooey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4xhhXVvNL4)! De de de de de de daaaa.
