Catherine spotted these today:

[ ![Trunki Case](http://www.thenaturalbabyresource.com/store/images/trunki_blue.jpg)](http://www.thenaturalbabyresource.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=991&osCsid=4191e6608f690343951ef1ba5eddd10d)

They are called [Trunkis](http://www.thenaturalbabyresource.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=991&osCsid=4191e6608f690343951ef1ba5eddd10d) and I just love the idea - a travel case that doubles as a ride-on toy. I stood in Gatwick yesterday watching kids going stir crazy in the check-in queue. These would definitely help. Might even be fun for bored adults too.
