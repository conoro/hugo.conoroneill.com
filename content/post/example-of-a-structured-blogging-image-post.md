Hmm, not really sure what this adds over a few simple rel= tags. 

Also, "Upload Image" seems to be broken for this (and for the people showcase). 

Would it not make more sense to allow URLs over to Flickr etc rather than insisting that the files be hosted locally? I have the same issue with the audio and video post types too.

But I'll post this anyway so people can see what the format is like.
