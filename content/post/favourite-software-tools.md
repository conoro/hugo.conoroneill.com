<div style="clear:both;"></div>Not flu - vicious throat infection and tonsil infection. Still in bits. Still agony to swallow saliva. So up late again. I got a new twin-CPU machine in work on Wednesday. I decided to write a list of all of the tools I definitely needed to install on it in addition to the corporate installs. I assumed it it would be 10 or 15\. Bloody hell, more like 40\. Some are obvious, others are quite nichey. Here's what I can remember off the top of my head (most are free apart from the obvious ones)

* Firefox (+ Adblock, Sitebar, ReloadEvery, Flashgot, User Agent Switcher, ieview, Image Zoom, Linky, Jump Link, BugMeNot, Mozilla Archive Format, Slashfix, Disable Targets for Downloads, Tabbrowser Preferences, BetterSearch, Bloglines Toolkit and Livelines. Whew!)
* Thunderbird (+ Enigmail)
* OpenOffice 2.0 Beta
* Cygwin - pseudo Unix env on your PC. Free XWindows is top notch.
* Dexpot - Good virtual screens tool
* FreeMind - Great Mind Mapping tool
* eWallet - Secure Password storage for PC and Palm
* Filezilla - Good FTP Client
* Inkscape  - Good SVG Editor
* Irfanview - Fantastic Graphics viewer
* Maxthon - For sites that only support IE (Bloody Ulster Bank - care to join the 21st Century? Netscape 4.7 for the love of god)
* NVU - HTML Editor
* Open Workbench - Nifty MS Project replacement
* Password Safe - Good simple Password manager
* PSPad - Fantastic Text Editor with syntax highlighting support for lots of languages
* RapidSVN - Reasonable GUI for Subversion Version Control System
* TortoiseSVN - Better Subversion GUI
* TrueCrypt - Free Disk Encryption
* UltraVNC - the best of the VNC's
* Gaim - the best multi-protocol IM client
* GIMP 2 - Great graphics editor
* GPGTray - neat GPG tool for the System Tray
* PDFCreator - Fantastic free PDF Maker
* Process Explorer - For killing those processes that Windows can't
* ZipGenius - The best of the free WinZip Clones
* Google Desktop Search - Words fail me......
* SyncBack - Handy Sync/Backup tool
* Putty - Great SSH Client
* J2EE 1.4 - Everything you need for basic Enterprise Java Dev
* .Net 1.1 - To use any of the .Net Dev Tools
* NetBeans 4.1 Beta - Great Java IDE. Supports J2EE 1.4
* Eclipse 3.0 - Another Great Java IDE (and Perl too if you are feeling weird)
* Perl IDE - Nice free dev IDE and Debugger for Perl
* Activestate Perl - For those scripting jobs
* Activestate Python - FOr those scripting jobs where others have to read your code
* Inno Setup - Fab Setup tool like Installshield
* Jude Community - Lovely UML tool all the way from Japan
* Visual Studio .Net 2003 - A mother of a piece of software
* SharpDevelop - If you can't afford Visual Studio .Net 2003
* MySQL - For some of my web tools
* SQL Server 2000 - Only ?40 or so for the developers edition
* Oracle 9i - Free for development purposes
* Apache 2 - For all my web tools
* Tomcat 5.5 - For all my initial Servlet and JSP development
