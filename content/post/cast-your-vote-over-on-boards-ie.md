I love the mock election thing they are running over on [boards.ie](http://www.boards.ie/vote/). Basically you can input your voting preferences for your constituency and see what the patterns are like already. Cork South West has only had 142 votes so far and it'd be great to see more to get a better sample set. It would be also good to get as wide a demographic as possible voting rather than the usual boards.ie users.

Please don't abuse it, they are watching out for that.

[Current stats for CSW](http://www.boards.ie/vote/results.php?c_id=8) are very interesting. I'd be very surprised if they match the outcome assuming that the number of remote mountain farmers on boards.ie is pretty small!
