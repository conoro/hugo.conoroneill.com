I spent quite a few hours last night working through many of the Event/Calendar sites on the web to see if any of them supported the automated collection of events from blogs which use the hCalendar format in structured blog posts. So far I have found tons of discussion but no actual implementation. Does anyone out there know of a site which does this (or know of one under development)?

The ones I checked were:

[Upcoming](http://www.upcoming.org/): I see quite a few mentions of Upcoming in this context but nothing obvious on the site
[Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/): Nothing at all
[Zvents](http://www.zvents.com/): Ditto but looks like it might be a fit
[OpenEvents](http://www.openevents.com/): Pay only so couldn't find out
[Eventful](http://eventful.com/): They mention it on the site as coming so fingers crossed.

[Evite](http://www.evite.com/): Doesn't look like a good fit.
[WhizSpark](http://www.whizspark.com/): Pay only so couldn't find out
[30 Boxes](http://30boxes.com/): Might be a good match too but didn't see anything about it.
