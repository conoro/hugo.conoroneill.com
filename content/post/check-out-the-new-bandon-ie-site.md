Brilliant job by Andrew Kingston of [Arkutech.ie](http://arkutech.ie) in building the new[ bandon.ie](http://www.bandon.ie/) site.

A quick poke around confirmed that it is built on the same fantastic Wordpress foundation as this fine blog.

A certain person named [Donncha O'Caoimh](http://ocaoimh.ie/) is one of the main developers of [Wordpress ](http://www.wordpress.org/)and just lives a few miles away in Blarney. Bandon is clearly commited to buying local. OK Wordpress is free but you get my point!

The site is now much easier for Trevor and the crew to update regularly and most importantly of all, the site now has comments. This might seem a small thing to you but the importance of giving people the ability to have their voice heard online about local issues should never be underestimated.

The site is Â a superb local community resource, so head on over right away and check out [the new site](http://www.bandon.ie). **And leave a comment there!**

p.s. if you are a Twitter user and want to keep abreast of updates on the new Bandon site, just follow [@bandon](http://twitter.com/bandon) there and it'll automatically post a link any time there is a update.
