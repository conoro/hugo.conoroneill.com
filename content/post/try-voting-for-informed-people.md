[Justin has done a great post](http://taint.org/2007/04/10/134819a.html) on Patricia McKenna of the Green Party trying to justify non-vaccination of children on The Last Word radio show. The transcript shows what Cooper is capable of when he puts his mind to it. He slays the idiot and her nonsense. 

If your child dies from the side-effects of measles, it'll be due to you listening to uniformed clueless dimwits like her. Remember that when you are casting your vote. Oh and don't drink the water, [it's CIA mind control](http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-46,GGGL:en&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=fluoridation+mind+control&spell=1).

UPDATE 1: On a related topic, [the HSE have announced](http://breakingnews.ie/ireland/?jp=MHAUGBAUQLQL) that all babies born in Cork from this October onwards will be routinely offered the BCG vaccine against TB. Welcome to the 20th century. Oh wait a sec, that's over already. Wonder if there will be any civil suits taken against the individual bozos responsible for the current situation between now and then?
