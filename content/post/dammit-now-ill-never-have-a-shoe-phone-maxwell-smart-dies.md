Now listen carefully. Don Adams, who played [Maxwell Smart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Smart) in one of the best shows of my youth [has died aged 82](http://news.com.com/2061-10786_3-5884139.html?part=rssandtag=5884139andsubj=news). The show actually aired from 1965 to 1970 in the US but I didn't see it until well into the 70's. A very very silly series which I will never forget.

I cannot walk through any building with more than two swing doors in sequence without that tune starting in my head  duh duh duh duuuuuuh, duh duh duh duuuuh... 

Shocking Update: My wife has no idea what I am talking about. I thought everyone of our generation got their first taste of Mel Brooks via Agent 99? And we lived in 2-channel hell for most of the 70's!
