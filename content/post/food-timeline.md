[Marc Canter](http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/04/next-round-of-interesting-links-early-april-06) has a nice link over to a [Food Time Line](http://www.foodtimeline.org/) showing the when, why and what of a bunch of different foods like ice-cream, french onion soup and worcestershire sauce. Well worth a read if you ever wondered when things like fish and chips became popular.
