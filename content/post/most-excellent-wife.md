Lovely breakfast in bed and the gift of a [Hairy Baby T-Shirt](http://www.hairy-baby.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/39/products_id/1209). [Check those guys out](http://www.hairy-baby.com/catalog/index.php), they have really great stuff. 

Mine has a picture of the boys from "Withnail and I" with the byline "are you the farmer?". It's a pity I didn't have it yesterday for the Bandon Show. For those of you who have forgotten the movie, here is [an MP3 of the line](http://www.withnail-and-i.com/sounds/14.mp3) (delicate dispositions should not click it). That site has a raft of [all the great soundclips](http://www.withnail-and-i.com/sounds.php) from all the characters.
