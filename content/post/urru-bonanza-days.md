Just got a mail from Ruth in Urru, Bandon. They have come up with a great idea called bonanza days. It kicks off with all kitchenware half price on Fri 29th/Sat 30th! I'll definitely be popping in for that.

Future bonanzas will include â‚¬1 coffee days, Free Urru Cotton Shopping Bags , Massive Savings on Wines, Cookery Books, Farmhouse Cheeses, Easter Eggs, Lucky Dips and more.

Mmmm, latte.

I love seeing Urru making a mockery of the long-held belief that you can't do gourmet in Bandon. Now we just need a few more really good restaurants.
