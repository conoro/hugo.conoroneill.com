*   Brutal nights sleep with the sore elbow. Allegedly slept with arm in air for part of the night! Quiet night on twittersphere. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12872131)
*   Great way to do Twitter Technorati claim via Mr Messina [http://tinyurl.com/2aqbtm.](http://tinyurl.com/2aqbtm.) Pity T'rati bombed out 4 times before working. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12900391)
*   Health Board does it again. After "Sibín O'Neill", then having TWO children called "Sibéal" they now name Catherine "Mrs Grainne Sheehy" [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12903171)
*   @fergusb - WIll there be a red carpet in Cannes? Madoona? I'd be very surprised if you didn't find a Shoarama down a side-street :-) [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12908481)
*   When did Calacanis start using MP4s for his podcasts? 185MB transfer to Nokia N70 via USB fails regularly and doesn't play anyway. MP3 pleas [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/12913541)
*   Argh. Spent most of day trying to get to bottom of email issue on loudervoice to discover 5 mins ago that it is a DNS problem. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13245591)
*   Slaps hand. Non-creatives should not "have a quick look" at an icon problem for four hours. As you can see, a very productive day for me. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13247391)
*   @tommorris - Started programming aged 14 in 1982 on a ZX Spectrum. Pretty much stopped in college (Electronics). Always done a bit since. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13262591)
*   @tommorris - even when I shouldn't be programming. Never do anything big any more but like to do the odd script for efficiency. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/13264471)
