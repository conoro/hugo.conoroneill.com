I've done a post over [on our business blog](http://www.argolon.com/2008/07/24/west-cork-enterprise-board-support/) about the supports offered to local business by [West Cork Enterprise Board](http://www.wceb.ie/). If you are based in the region, it's well worth reading. The highlights are:

*   6 hour IT Consultancy for €150 via Tech-Check
*   Feasibility Study Grants up to €5100
*   International Trade Show Attendance Grants up to €2000
*   Ecommerce Web-site development Grants up to €1500
That last one is absolutely brilliant. If you are making any sort of product (I'm thinking crafts and food in West Cork) that could also be sold by mail order, you'd be nuts not to avail of it. Note that the grants are all done on the basis of "matching funds".
