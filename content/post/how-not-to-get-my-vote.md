I cannot understand why Christy O'Sullivan thinks he'll get a vote from me. Here is a guy shoe-horned in by FF at a national level who sends me flyers with absolutely no information on them about who he is, what he believes in, where he lives, what he has accomplished as a politician or why I should vote for him. 

And of course his website doesn't load!

Inserting this nobody over a well known local politician like Alan Coleman is a huge mistake by FF. I don't know how well Coleman would have done in this climate but at least he has a known reputation.

I will not vote for anonymous candidates from any party.
