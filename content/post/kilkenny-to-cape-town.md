Paul Brennan let me know the other day about a very worthwhile effort by his friend Hugh Bergin. Hugh is doing a motorbike trip from Kilkenny to Capetown. It is a personal trip but he's trying to raise some money for the charity [Self Help](http://www.selfhelp.ie/selfhelp/Main/Home.asp). Self Help is an Irish development agency engaged in promoting and implementing integrated sustainable development programmes in rural Africa.

He started his journey late in 2006 and he is currently in the Congo region, still going strong and keeping [a diary of his adventure](http://www.kilkennytocapetown.com/index.html).

You can [sponsor him here](http://www.shdi.org/selfhelp/Main/_load_k2c.asp).

Best of luck to him. My guess is that the Kilkenny to Inistioge leg was the most challenging ;-)
