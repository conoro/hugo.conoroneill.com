This gave me goosebumps: 

[Microdrives](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7744297797233161593)

You have no idea, none, how much I wanted a microdrive as a teenage geek. I would have happily chopped off my little finger yakuza-style to get one. And this guy, the luckiest man alive, has 8 of them!

And what is it about rose tinted spectacles that I would be happier now to be given a ZX Spectrum +2 with a Kempston joystick than a fully loaded Dell XPS?

I automatically deride anything that Nicholas Negroponte is involved in as snake-oil (Media Lab Dublin, I laughed when they announced it, I laughed when they closed it). But the [$100 laptop](http://laptop.org/) has the potential to create a whole new generation of programmers from places you would never have dreamed, just like the Spectrum, BBC Micro and C-64 did for us as kids. Let's hope he doesn't screw it up.

I think maybe we've all forgotten the impact those machines, and "The Computer Programme" on the BBC had on a multitude of British and Irish kids. I shudder to think what I would be working at now if my parents hadn't had the foresight to get me a Spectrum when I badgered them incessantly for it. And I know I've blogged this before, but [it is still the funniest thing on the whole damned internet](http://www2.b3ta.com/heyhey16k/).
