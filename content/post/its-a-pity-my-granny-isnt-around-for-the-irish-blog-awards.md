My Dad kindly voted for this blog in several categories in [the Blog Awards](http://awards.ie/nominations/) earlier. He mailed me to say that it reminded him of my Granny (Mary O'Neill) who voted for [Dev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamon_de_Valera) eight times in the 1932 elections on both sides of the bridge in New Ross. Could you imagine if those old [Cumann na mBan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumann_na_mBan) women were around now and decided to help the blog result?
