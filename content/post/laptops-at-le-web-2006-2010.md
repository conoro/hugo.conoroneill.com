I've gone to [Le Web](http://www.leweb.net/) every year since 2006\. It's the stand-out event for those working in the Web in Europe. Every December I head over to Paris and come back wit h a head full of ideas and plans.

Ewan Spence is another regular at it and it's pretty much the only time we see each other every year. [He has a great post](http://www.ewanspence.com/blog/2009/11/06/whats-the-perfect-computer-for-le-web/) over on his blog about what computer to bring this year. It seems like we are all going more and more lightweight each time (well our computers are anyway).

It inspired me to take this set of photos.
