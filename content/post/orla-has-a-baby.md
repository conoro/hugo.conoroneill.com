My younger sister Orla gave birth to her first child last Saturday around 7.30 am. Hannah Rose is a wee titch, weighing in at a little over 6 lbs. She is an absolute stunner and all are well and at home already. Nana Rose is allegedly chuffed that all her granddaughters have Rose as their middle name. Our boys are now totally confused with two cousin Hannah's. This summer should be fun with all the girly cousins on holidays together.
