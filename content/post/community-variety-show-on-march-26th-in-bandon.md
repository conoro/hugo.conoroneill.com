Every year the great people who run the Rosmini centre for adults with an intellectual disability organise a fun and interesting event to promote community integration and inclusion for everyone. This year they are organising a community variety show.

It's on Friday the 26th of March in the GAA Hall in Bandon. Doors opening at 7.15, show starts at 8 sharp. It is not a fund raising event so tickets will be at the very affordable cost of â‚¬5 each.

The show will include:

*   A DJ
*   Singing and Music
*   Magic and Tricks (both kids and adults)
*   Bingo
*   Dance and Comedy
*   Raffle
*   Street Dancers
There will be spot prizes between performances.

Sounds like a great fun night for all the family. You should start seeing signs for it around the town soon.
