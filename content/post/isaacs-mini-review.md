We went out with some vendors last night to Isaac's in town. I've often heard it mentioned in the past. It was jammed at 7.30 when we arrived and was still jammed at 9.30 when we left. Fantastic room with great decor and a very nice feel to the place.

Service all night was quite sullen but good and efficient. Slight issue with the booze. Our foreign visitors wanted Guinness and all that was on offer was Henineken or Budweiser Budvar from the Czech Republic. Where were these visitors from? Yup you guessed it.

As all were tired we went straight for main courses. Menu was one of those kitchen sink types with pasta, steak, curry and anything else anyone could ever ask for. Zero sense of a "style" of cooking. I went with one of the specials which was john dory on a red pepper sauce. The others went with things across the entire range. My sauce was fine, my side vegetables tasty and my fish overcooked to rubber. Everyone elses looked ok and were all big portions.

Coffees were good.

Average over-priced food. But as I said, they were jammed so well done to them on finding a lucrative niche.
