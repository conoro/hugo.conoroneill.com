Inspired by [Red Mum's recent pizza making post,](http://redmum.blogspot.com/2006/07/easy-peasy-pizza.html) the awesome [DiFara Pizza story](http://inpraiseofsardines.typepad.com/blogs/2006/07/a_taste_so_deli.html) and my experiences in [The Good Things Cafe](http://www.thegoodthingscafe.com/) recently, I decided to make some pizza-pies with the two middle childer yesterday. We made one each. Classic Margherita with simple garlic/oregano/basil/passata sauce and buffalo mozzarella.

Which was the nicest? Yup, the 2 year old's. After the horror of watching them "knead" the dough and drop it on the floor several times, the two little gits ended up with far superior results because [a] they were not swimming in sauce and [b] the were wafer thin cos I only gave them a small bit of dough each. Mine was more like a soup on a bap. All tasted fantastic tho.
