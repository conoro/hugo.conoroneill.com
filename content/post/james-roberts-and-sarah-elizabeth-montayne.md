<div style="clear:both;"></div>Wow, two birth announcements on the same day. Helen and Frank Roberts had baby James at 19:55 on 20th August, a strapping boy of 9lb 15oz. Whilst Betsy and Brian Montayne had a bouncing baby girl, Sarah Elizabeth, at 21:10 on the same day. Massive congrats to both sets of parents and here's hoping both mothers feel a lot better over the next few days.
