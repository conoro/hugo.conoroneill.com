So if food lovers are foodies and wine lovers are winos ;-) I've decided that fish lovers are fishies. Just got a comment on [an old blog post](http://conoroneill.com/2005/12/04/hey-dad-thats-the-same-ugly-fish-as-last-week) about the fish shop in Union Hall and it's all good news:
> we Glenmar Shellfish have now merged with Antcar over 12mths ago - if you are ever in Union Hall again be sure and call into the shop again - The Fish Shop - you will not be disappointed - we have recently extended the shop and added alot of additional products to our impressive array of fish - including mussels !!- we also now have a wine licence and stock a very impressive selection of wines - look forward to seeing you soon!!

I'm embarrassed that it has been that long since I was down to buy some fish. Having heard this tho, we're already thinking about what fish we're going to cook this weekend. If I can drag my lazy ass out of bed on Saturday morning, I'll be down for a look!
