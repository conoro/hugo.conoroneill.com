Guinness has a blog. All the skinny at [gapingvoid](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/002249.html).

Looks like a pretty decent attempt at a corporate blog. They have a posting about [great Guinness ads](http://www.guinnessblog.co.uk/blogs/guinnessblog/archive/2006/02/13/17.aspx). One thing I've always hated about their web-site is that if you want to see their genius US ads instead of their dire "meaningful" Irish ones, you have to pretend to be in the US when signing in on the home page. Boys, dump the swimming across the Atlantic crap and give us "Brilliant!" over here please.
