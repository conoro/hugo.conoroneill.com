<div style="clear:both;"></div>A wee bit delayed, we are tickled pink to announce the birth of Chloe Sheila Johnston on June 30th in the Coombe to Louise and Kieran. The little darling weighed in at 6lbs 15oz, so our young fella should be easily able to bully her. 

Kieran has decided to forego a property development empire to set up a hedge fund trading in pampers futures. It appears there is far more money to be made in nappies. Hopefully we'll see them soon so she can meet her country cousins and demand the presence of a translator.

Whilst we are at it - big congrats to Kieran on being made partner. The little pup.
