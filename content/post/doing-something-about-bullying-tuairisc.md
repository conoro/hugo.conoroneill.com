Brian Greene contacted me last week about a new project he has just launched called [Tuairisc.me](https://tuairisc.me/). Like many good ideas, it's brilliantly simple. It's an anti-bullying form for school web-sites that can be added with a single line of HTML to any site.

[![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tuairsc-logo-wide.png "tuairsc-logo-wide")](https://tuairisc.me/)

I sent some questions/thoughts over to Brian and his responses convinced me that this thing has legs. But it will only work if as many people as possible know about it.

So if you are a parent, a teacher or even a student, let's make this happen for your school. Get them to go to [Tuairisc.me](https://tuairisc.me/), sign the school up for the FREE service and grab that one line of code.

If the school gets stuck adding the code, I'm sure many people, including me, would be glad to figure it out for you.

Then get the message out. If your school uses SMS, send one. If it uses school-bag paper-slips, use that. Put posters in the school telling kids they can safely and securely report bullying via the school's site.

[Tuairisc](https://tuairisc.me/) is another perfect example of a motivated tech person getting us from "someone should do something about this" to actually doing something about it. I hope we see many more.
