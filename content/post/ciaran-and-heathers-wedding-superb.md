<div style="clear:both;"></div>It's not often I comment on a wedding but last weekends wedding of Ciarán and Heather was absolutely brilliant. From the lovely church in Tinahely to the beautifal location for the reception in Ballybeg House to the phenomenal catering, great crowd, top atmosphere and razor sharp speeches, we all left with huge grins on our faces.
Of course I'm now getting flashbacks of the picture shown by Eoin O'B of Ciarán in First Year Eng with his German 'tache. Shudder.
And they organised the whole thing in 3 months! Both looked stunning and the wicklow air meant no hangover the following morning.
CandT survived baby-sitting our three monsters for the night. A very successful weeekend all in all.
And Mark _did_ look like a vet, no matter what he says.
