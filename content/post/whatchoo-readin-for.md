(In the immortal words of Bill Hicks).
<p style="text-align: center;">Just got an email to tell me that the [West Cork Literary Festival](http://www.westcorkliteraryfestival.ie/) will run from July 5th to 11th.

Now I'm not the most literary person in the world. My last three books were "Presenting to Win", "Bad Science" and something by Harlan Coben. Next up is "On the Origin of Species". But even I've heard of some of the heavy-hitters who'll be attending the festival. Annie Proulx, Roger McGough, Francesca Simon and Louis de Bernières are just four of the writers appearing at this year’s event which features some of the best writers, poets and illustrators from Ireland and abroad.

The Official Festival Launch is in Bantry, leading to a top few days of readings, seminars, workshops, children’s events, exhibitions, music and good old-fashioned hospitality.

Booking for the Festival is on 027 55987\. All info on [the web-site](http://www.westcorkliteraryfestival.ie).
