The updated [Irish Politics](http://www.politicsinireland.com/) site is now live. This is a tremendous resource for anyone interested in what people on the ground are writing about politics here.

It is a site that watches for any blog posts that mention a TD's name and provides a summary of that post on the site. It is party neutral and is in no way partisan.

Those with blogs can add a widget which displays the latest politics posts on their own blog sidebar. Of course readers can now subscribe by email to get all the latest posts.
