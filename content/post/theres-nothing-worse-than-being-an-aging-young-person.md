I don't want this blog to turn into a list of great people who have died, but I've just read that Richard Pryor has passed away. 

There is an excellent obituary on [the Washington Post site](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121001406.html).

Lovely quotes [on Yahoo](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051211/ap_en_mo/pryor_quote_box).

And if you've never heard him at his foul-mouthed best, you can listen to some [clips on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004YR3M/underneathele-20/701-0650328-1305129?creative=330649&camp=8641&link_code=as1)- hell go buy the box set whilst you are at it.

He was one of those guys who just made you laugh by standing on stage. It was amazing watching anger transformed into humour. Even his bad movies were worth a look.

He dies and yet Bernard Manning just keeps on going. It's not fair is it?
