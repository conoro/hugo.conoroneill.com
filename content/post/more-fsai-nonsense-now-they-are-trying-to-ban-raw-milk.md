After the pork recall debacle, you'd thing the FSAI would get a bit of cop-on but obviously they need to keep inventing make-work to keep themselves in jobs. Their latest wheeze is to try and ban Raw Milk. Not bleach-cleaned chicken nuggets or mechanically recovered meat burgers or sausages with 53% "meat". No, they want to ban a product that some people actively seek out and choose to drink.

I'm really really getting sick and tired of this bullshit. It's a miracle that you can still buy unpasteurised cheese in this country with these drones in charge. If I want to drink raw milk I damn well will and I won't have some paper-shuffler using "safety" as a code-word for control, telling me otherwise.

The last time I had raw milk I was about 6 years old. It was straight from the cow in my Grand-aunt's house. I didn't really like it. But I'm bloody going out this week to see if I can buy some more.

[Slow Food Ireland has a petition](http://www.slowfoodireland.com/index.php/food/raw-milk-petition.html) to try and stop these muppets having their way. I strongly recommend that you sign it before all of your rights to buy and eat what you like are taken away from you.

We really seem to be heading towards a world of zero responsibility and zero consequences with faceless bureaucrats deciding everything. The ongoing collapse of the European project shows exactly where that leads.
