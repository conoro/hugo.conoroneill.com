The [Empire](http://www.fsai.ie/) may have done its best to kill the pork industry in Ireland but the producers are fighting back. Barrie Tyner from [Slow Food Ireland](http://www.slowfoodireland.com/) just let me know that the West Cork and Cork City Conviviums are coming together to bring us 'The Pig Extravaganza'.

I was disappointed to find that this did not include dancing pigs but it's the next best thing :-) To celebrate National Pork Weekend, an evening of eating and great chat is planned down west on Sunday, the 18th of January.

Speakers include award winning butcher Martin Carey. Willie and Avril Allshire of Caherbeg Free Range Pork Farm and Rosscarbery Recipes, Frank Krawcykz, salami maker and artisan, Anthony Creswell of Ummera Smoked Bacon plus guest chefs.

Over the years I've driven past many signs for the Ballyjamesduff Pork Festival. I hope we could have something like that down here every year too. Imagaine a giant cook-out with BBQs and Smokers going all day? Yummmmm!

I'll post an update it when the venue (probably in Bandon) is confirmed. If you love anything made from pork and you want to show your support for fantastic local producers, then I hope to see you there.

UPDATE: The details of the day have been finalised:

Time: 12.00 Noon, Sunday January 19th. Location: Heron Court, Market Quay, Bandon. A 3 course lunch will be served with talks and demonstrations from artisan food producers including award winning Bandon butcher, Martin Carey, Willie and Avril Allshire of Caherbeg, Frank Krawcykz of West Cork Salamis, and Anthony Creswell of Ummera Smoked Products. €30.00 for Slow Food Members, €35.00 for Non-Members. Booking essential as numbers limited. slowfoodwestcork AT gmail DOT com or 086 067 6249.
