On April 3rd I joined [nearForm](http://nearform.com) as [Chief Product Officer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conoroneill/). I genuinely believe nearForm is destined for all-time greatness and I want to contribute to that.

One of my career highlights so far was playing a part in the acquisition of FeedHenry by [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com). The day I found out that they were a potential buyer will always stay with me. I have had 2.5 amazing years with them and my opinion has only gone up as time progressed. 

Red Hat is one of the world's great companies. What they have achieved with Linux and now with products like OpenShift has completely transformed the software industry. In their last financial year they generated $2.4 billion in revenue with entirely free software.

What makes Red Hat special is its culture. They manage to combine an absolute commitment to Open Source with a completely rigorous commercial sensibility.

In nearForm I see the next Red Hat. It too has that magical combination of community and commercial. In the coming months we'll be talking a lot more about nearForm's Open Source contributions. It goes far far beyond what most people realise. Yet we are also growing at an amazing rate.

I strongly recommend you read [yesterday's blog post by Paul Cormier](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/blog/what-makes-us-red-hat), President of PnT in Red Hat, on Open Source. Two of the most important takeaways for me were:

> We donâ€™t believe in open core models, or in being just consumers but not contributors to the projects we depend on. We do this because we still believe in our core that the open source development model is THE best model to foster innovation, faster.

&nbsp;

> Will there be another Red Hat? I hope and expect that there will be several. Open source is now the proven methodology for developing software. The days of enterprises relying strictly on proprietary software has ended.

I've never been more excited to start a new job. 

If you'd like to be part of our journey, [we're hiring](http://www.nearform.com/careers/) for UX, Front-End, Back-End and DevOps roles right now.
