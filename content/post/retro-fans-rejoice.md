I just heard about this site yesterday and it's absolutely wonderful. They have a ton of the old ZX Spectrum games available to play online and your scores are included in various league tables. A perfect 21st Century improvement to 20th Century games.

Most of your old faves are there, I've just been playing the ever-brilliant Jet Set Willy. I love just clicking around and being reminded of many happy hours as a teenager in the 80's.

Sure it's nostalgic but it's also bloody good fun. When the graphics were that bad, playability became the number one aim and that hasn't diminished over the years.

So are you the best ZX Spectrum player in the world?
