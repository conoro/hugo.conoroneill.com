If you have Windows XP and if it hasn't happened already then Microsoft appear to be pushing out the new release of the Internet Explorer Web Browser. They are making it optional so you have to agree to install before they do (the security centre logo in the bottom right hand corner of the screen that looks like a shield will be yellow with an exclamation mark in it).

For almost all web users who don't use Firefox as their browser, IE7 is a big improvement over IE6\. The most obvious visible difference is that you can now use tabs to browse. This just means that you can have many sites open within one browser window rather than in multiple windows. Middle click using the mouse wheel on a link should open up a new tab with that link.

One unfathomable change is that the menu bar at the top is turned off by default. If that freaks you, as it did me, just right click at the very top of the IE window and there should be an option to turn it on.

There are two utterly broken sites that I use with which you cannot use IE7\. The first is Enterprise Ireland whose site is just badly designed and non standards compliant and the second is Ulster Bank Online Business Banking. I've ranted enough about how embarrassing the Ulster site is. They have upgraded home users to something designed in the 21st century, we're still waiting for them to do that on the business side.

Most people should install it and will be happy with it. The more people who do, the more designers of badly written web-sites will be forced to learn a few standards.
