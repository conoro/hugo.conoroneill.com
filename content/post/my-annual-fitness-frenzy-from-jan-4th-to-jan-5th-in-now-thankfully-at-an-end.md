After walking quite quickly from the car to the office today in order to burn those extra 4 calories, I suffered slight dizziness at the bottom of the stairs with the thought of walking up them. Luckily I came to my senses and can now happily slob out for another 12 months.

The [Unfit Comic Strip](http://dilbert.com/comics/unfit/) just gets better and better. This is a ripe time of the year for it.

Scott Adams is a big fan and has [posted an Ad on his blog](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/01/comic_artist_wa.html) for an illustrator to help Mike Belkin so that he can concentrate on working on the actual content.

Insincere apologies once again for infringing on a multitude of copyrights by posting the comic strip here.
