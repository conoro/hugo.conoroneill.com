I saw the first episode of Heston's cookery series on TV this evening. He simultaneously tickled my foodie and engineering fancies with some of the things he showed. He deconstructed the classic Black Forest Gateau, found out what the real essence of it was and then rebuilt it using some awesome techniques.

Watching him aerate chocolate using a Tupperware container, a vacuum-bag for storing clothes and a vacuum cleaner was a 2006 TV highlight for me.

Before I die I want to eat once in [The Fat Duck](http://www.fatduck.co.uk/) and once in [elBulli](http://www.elbulli.com/). [This new business](http://www.loudervoice.com/) had better work out or that'll remain a dream!&nbsp;
