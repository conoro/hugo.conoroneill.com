I have a series of long-overdue customer support horror stories to write about, but this one really has me enraged.

TL;DR I ordered something from Pineberry Pi in Poland. It shipped to Ireland. Fedex insists I need to pay import duties. Pineberry Pi is acting like it's not their problem. Avoid doing business with all these people.

I've been shopping online since 1997. I've been shopping from EU sites using the Euro since 2002ish. Poland joined the EU in 2004. I didn't have to think about import duties once in Europe from then until Brexit. And most decent UK sites now handle all the fees/duties/VAT well.

So when I ordered a HatDrive from Pineberry Pi in November, I assumed the price I paid was for everything. Once I got a shipment notification, I figured it'd be a few days to arrive via Fedex. How wrong I was. For some insane reason, Fedex decided to send it:

Poland > Germany > France > Netherlands > UK > Ireland.

Seriously! It took nearly two weeks to arrive. I get stuff from Aliexpress in China quicker. But worse, they started sending me notifications that I owed import duties. On an intra-EU shipment! I tried contacting them via various methods but was basically ignored. Finally they delivered it and no mention was made of fees by the courier. So I assumed my messages had gotten through.

Then the letters started arriving. Approx one a week. For the past two months! Getting ever more threatening about debt collectors etc.

I once again tried to contact Fedex and Pineberry Pi. The very helpful Fedex Twitter team pointed me to an Irish email address. The Pineberry guys responded with an automatic email stating that something had gone wrong in the automated setup of all the deliveries via the Fedex API. The email said I was to explain this and tell the local Irish team to contact the Poland team. Then the problem would then go away.

Fedex Ireland replied once to say some box had been ticked incorrectly by Pineberry Pi, as if this was my fault.

That was two months ago. The letters keep coming. I've emailed and Tweeted both Fedex and Pineberry Pi multiple times. They just ignore me. And the letters keep coming.

I don't care what went wrong between Pineberry and Fedex Poland. It's not my problem. I never agreed to pay import duties of any kind. I am not liable for anything here. It's only a small amount of money, but I'm not paying a nonsensical charge on an Intra-EU shipment. I'm not going to be bullied into paying for something I don't owe. I'm not going to be threatened by debt collectors for something I don't owe.

So Fedex and Pineberry, get your shit together and sort this out.

Pineberry Pi, I know you're a new company. But if you think this is how customer support works, you won't last very long.

Everyone else. Have a long hard think about who you want to do business with. I'll be buying my next SSD Hat from the fantastic team in [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/).
