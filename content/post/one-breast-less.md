Catherine discovered Haydn and Roos' latest blog yesterday, it is called [One Breast Less](http://www.onebreastless.com/) and I don't think I need to tell you what it is about. This is a shockingly good blog with a raw honesty that caught me off-guard but is a mandatory read if you have any interest in health, illness and recovery. 

My granny had a mastectomy due to breast cancer and my aunt has just finished a course of radium so I'll be reading closely. It is blogs like One Breast Less that remind you what a powerful medium blogging really is, one which allows you to get to the heart of a subject without ever needing to think about a publisher or demographics. 

Haydn's recent writing has got me thinking (but not doing yet) a lot about diet. As soon as Catherine is getting a decent nights sleep we'll switch back to the healthy us as we usually do after each baby. I'll be using a lot of the information on [The Diet Cast](http://www.thedietcast.com/) and [My Diet Friends](http://www.mydietfriends.com/) for that.
