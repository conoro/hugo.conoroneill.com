For one very scary moment, I thought we had accidentally rented out a special Australian Edition of "Batman Begins" redubbed with Sir Les Patterson as Batman, Dame Edna Everage as Rachel Dawes and Michael Caine as Alfred (oh, wait a sec).

Luckily we found Ireland somewhere around Latvia. This had Twink as Rachel Dawes...........
