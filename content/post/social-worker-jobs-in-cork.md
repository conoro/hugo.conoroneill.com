I just got a mail from someone thinking about re-locating from New York to Cork City. She asked what the job situation was like in Social Working. Any of my readers have knowledge in this area? Are there many jobs to be had? With who? In what areas? What qualifications do you need? Any equivalence given to foreign qualifications? Any pointers or useful sites they should check out? Thanks.
