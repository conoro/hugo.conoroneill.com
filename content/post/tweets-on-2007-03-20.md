*   Finally caught up on sleep and RSS feeds. Today is all about testing, tweaking and deploying updates. And two restaurant reviews. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/9987421)
*   Mail from person looking to move from NY to Cork. Anyone know the suss with Social Worker jobs down here? Qualifications? Openings? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/9988671)
*   Looks like we now work with blogger (using old API on new Blogger) but formatting horrendous. Time to tweak not tweet. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10024511)
*   From AOL - [http://ficlets.com/.](http://ficlets.com/.) "A ficlet is a short story that enables you to collaborate with the world". Lots of microformats too! [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10045671)
*   Bloody Blogger. Templates are a horror. Even Zeldman's "Son of Moto" has display: block just to mess up side by side images. Grrr. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10071621)
*   Kids off school today. In donkey-work mode as concentration impossible. Defrosted some of my October 06 Carrot and Coriander soup. Yum. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10074221)
*   Home made steak sambos for dinner. I should sell em they are that good. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10117671)
*   US Office is superb. "New York New York, so good they named it twice. Its second name is Manhattan". Steve Carrell is fabulous in it. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10169381)
*   Finally sitting down to dig into Yahoo Pipes with a practical purpose. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10196631)
*   Still having some issues with Twitter tools on Wordpress but loving them anyway. daily digest is the business! [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/10197481)
