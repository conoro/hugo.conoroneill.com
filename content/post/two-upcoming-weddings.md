<div style="clear:both;"></div>We're thrilled to hear that both Ciarán O'Colmáin and Ethna Winter are getting married (Ciarán in February and Ethna in January) Not many left to go now from the UCD Eng class of '90.......
Ethna is having her celebrations in Tattersalls near Fairyhouse which is about 2 miles from where I lived until I was 6 years old. Great place.

Ethna's other great news was the recent birth of her son Felix. I've already cracked particularly weak"Odd Couple" jokes about her lad meeting our Oscar for the first time.
