I got an email during the week from Mary Wedel who runs the brilliant [An Tobairín](http://www.antobairin.com/) Health Food Shop in Bandon. We've watched Mary grow this business since we arrived here from a pokey place on North Main Street to the bigger one on Factory Lane to the current flagship on South Main Street. I see no reason why she won't be as successful as [Whole Foods Market](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/) in the US.

The range of products on sale there has always amazed me. From vitamins to organic food, chocolate, cosmetics and alt-med stuff, she has something for everyone. Now I'll be totally open here, I'm not a fan of a large number of alt-med approaches despite having a friend who is a homeopath. However, having said that, there is a huge amount to be gained in the area of health by everyone thinking about the products they use on their bodies, and more importantly, the things they eat.

So her new project, the [Fionnuisce](http://www.natural-health.ie/) Healing Centre (web-site not live yet) in Heron Court on Market Quay holds great interest for me. Apart from the alt-med side, there is a large meeting room with a demonstration kitchen area. So far this space has been used for yoga, dance and various workshops including cookery demonstrations in co-operation with Karen Austin of legendary [Lettercollum Kitchen Project](http://www.lettercollum.ie/).

There are lots of interesting cookery events lined up for September that include a Sushi Saturday and Mediterranean Veg.  In October Karen will offer Indian Vegetarian, November Thai and December Christmas Veg.  There will be a wholefood cookery night class running Tuesdays from 1st week in October for 10 weeks with Dorothee Clarke.

She had me at sushi :-)

They are also running a cool 1-day drama workshop on Sunday 13th July by Belinda Wild who describes it as being for anyone with or without experience in Drama who is interested in exploring creative self-expression through the medium of theater - and she guarantees to make you laugh. I'd honestly be tempted, having played  Sybil Walling in "Brush with a Body" in the Kieran's College school play, aged 17.

If you are interested in any of the above, shoot Mary a TXT on 086-3882440\. I'm trying to convince her to start a blog since I think any place that has regular events is ideally suited to one instead of a static brochure page. It might be worth her putting all the events up on [Yahoo Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/) too.

UPDATE: Some of the dates for the foodie events are as follows:

*   Saturday 6th September, Succulent Sushi with Delwyn Klevenow
*   Suturday 20th September, Mediterranean Vegetables from Karen Austin's abundant garden
*   Saturday 18th October, Indian Vegetarian with Lettercollum Karen
*   Saturday 15th November, Thai Cookery with Lettercollum Karen
*   Saturday 12th December, Vegetarian Christmas with Karen
