I don't normally mention posts that I write on [blognation](http://ie.blognation.com/) over here but I think this one is probably of great interest to many of my local readers and those in more rural locations in Ireland and the UK.

A company called 3G Doctor in Kerry provides a service whereby you can get a video consultantion with a qualified doctor using your 3G phone. 

I've written [all about it here](http://ie.blognation.com/2007/11/07/3g-doctor-signals-the-return-of-house-visits/). I'd be interested to hear what you think and whether the 3G coverage is good enough yet so that it is useful to the people who need it most. 

For those who think 3G phones are outside their budget, the fabulous Sony Ericsson K800i is little more than â‚¬100 on pay monthly upgrade. That's barely two visits to the doctor.
