*   it really does look like the non-stop bluescreening on my as-new Latitude D420 was due to Vista. XP rock solid on it. Damn, I like Vista. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/19069261)
*   All Google properties down or Cork routing problem? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/19074981)

*   Co-incidence? You decide. [http://tinyurl.com/y9dchw](http://tinyurl.com/y9dchw) and [http://tinyurl.com/2nd3nk](http://tinyurl.com/2nd3nk) [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/19076381)
*   How much does Vodafone Ireland charge you and caller if you set redirect on your mobile to landline? Or to Skype-In? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/19091421)

*   Nice cuppa tea and a biscuit with TSL, TSG and MiniMe. We're awfully civilised down here in Cork. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/19360381)
*   Looking at world map on kid's wall. Scranton is marked in the USA. The equivalent of Slough in the US Office. Maybe not so small after all. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/19401361)
*   Bloody chocolate manufacturers. Why aren't the sweets inside the easter eggs like they used to be? Surely slave labour could do it cheaply? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/19433601)
