I've said it before and I'll say it again - this is fabulous TV.

House MD is one of those TV series I should hate. It stars Hugh Laurie with a put-on American accent as Gregory House, head of diagnostics at a Princeton hospital. 

It has exactly the same plot every week. Person comes in with confusing symptoms, starts heading towards death, team keeps trying to figure out what is wrong, use wrong treatment, make patient worse, finally just in the nick if time, they figure it out and patient is saved. There is always one rule:

But it's compelling viewing and is built around the fact that House is a complete misanthrope. He hates everyone equally but does it with such witty invective that you love him.

He suffers terrible pain from a serious surgery on his leg and is addicted to Vocidon (yes, I spelled wrong to stop spammers). This led to a great series of episodes where he made the mistake of pissing off a cop who then tried to do him for a variety of crimes to punish him for taking excess painkillers on the job.

The episode we watched last night had him in a wheelchair for a week as a bet so that he could get his old parking space back which had been given to a real wheelchair user. His argument was that he suffered more walking further with a cane than she did in a motorised wheelchair. 

As we are very bold people and may (or may not) have got our hands on bittorrented copies of all three series, we generally watch a couple at a time.

Fabulous TV!
