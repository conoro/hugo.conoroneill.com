I've always found the name of "Cafe Mao" offensive. I ate there once - mediocre at best. They are probably as good at cooking food as Mao was at growing it. In my little fantasy world, I'd love to set up a little stall outside of the Cafe and sell Pol Pot Noodles. Wonder how long before someone would complain?

As ever, someone else expresses this thought so much better than I can.
