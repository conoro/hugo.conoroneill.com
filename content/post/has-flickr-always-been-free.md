<div style="clear:both;"></div>I thought it was pay-only the last time I checked. Excellent, I now have a hosting site for any piccies I want to link to. Just looking through the features - bloody hell, I can see why people are raving about it. Can upload pictures via email, so I can send direct from my camera phone to Flickr. Can get it to automatically post the pictures to my blog, so straight from camera phone to blog. I think we'll be dumping the Canon Imagine site pretty soon for the Ixus photos if Flickr proves to be as good as it looks. I'd better check the upload limits I guess.
