<div style="clear: both" />Just wasted 2 hours of my life watching "Closer". What a steaming turd of a movie. Why do they make films about people who you just want to die within 10 minutes of the opening scene?

Not a great weekend of movies. "Meet the Fockers" was desperately disappointing - how lazy were they to blow the opportunity of having Hoffman and Streisand on the screen together? And "Ocean's 12" was only passable.

But all of the above were perfectly balanced on Sky Movies by the genius of Sam Raimi:

I can't wait to see Bruce Campbell playing Elvis in "Bubba Ho-tep"
