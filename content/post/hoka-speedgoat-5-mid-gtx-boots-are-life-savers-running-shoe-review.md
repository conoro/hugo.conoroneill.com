As you can read in [my review of the truly awful Salomon Vision shoes](https://conoroneill.com/2024/09/01/salomon-vision-review-is-another-ankle-breaker/), my hopes of running the Kerry Way Ultra in 2024 were ruined last weekend. I had an x-ray on Monday to confirm that it wasn't a break. 

I then went to my physio/PT on Tuesday. He confirmed multile ligament tears. He was pretty blunt that I'd be nuts to try KWU. Despite all the icing, compression and elevation that I had done since Saturday, I still had very restricted motion and some pain. He was surpised by the lack of pain which I took as a positive.

We eventually agreed that if I only walked, was extremely careful not to roll it again, wore an ankle brace and stopped as soon as it started hurting, then it wouldn't be a disaster if I tried to do a few km. He predicted I wouldn't be able to get up the steps at Torc Waterfall (7km). Of course that was a red rag to a bull.

I had two braces. One from Amazon and one from the x-ray clinic. Both were excellent but both were also uncomfortable in running shoes. I cut away at one and got it to a decent shape but I imagined it would be very uncomfortable quickly.

Then I had a brainwave - the boot versions of running shoes. And luckily the local running shop, The Edge in Cork, had a pair of Hoka Speedgoat 5 Mid GTX in stock, albeit half a UK size too big. Given that I originally planned to run in normal Speedgoat 5 GTX, this seemed like a no-brainer.

I was amused to see they also had Salomon lightweight hiking boots. I quickly moved on.

The extra size turned out to be an advantage with my swollen foot and I bought the Hokas without hesitation. I suspect they will be replaced by the Speedgoat 6 Mid GTX in the next few months as they are on discount in a lot of places. But as the 5 was a step backwards from the 4 (too stretchy), it sounds like the 6 is a step backwards from the 5 (too harsh).

I spent two days doing my normal KWU prep and had everything ready for a 200km jaunt despite knowing that I'd probably be out within a few km.

I stuck to the plan and walked away from the 6am start-line in Killarney as everyone else raced off. First few km on paths were fine but lots of niggles in both legs. I took it incredibly carefully in the park on the roots and rocks. After what seemed like an eternity, I got to Torc Waterfall and headed up the steps.

At the top of the steps I did a little woohoo and headed off on the Old Kenmare "Road" trail. And on I went. And on and on.

The boots were absolutely magical. I'm pretty sure my ankle tried to roll at least once every 5 minutes. But the Hokas wouldn't let it. Everything was held in tight. I had some discomfort for sure but I think that was mostly tender soft tissue rather than the torn ligaments.

I really couldn't believe it when I successfully got through the mountain pass between Black Valley and Bridia Valley. It's the roughest part of the 200km and I didn't have a single wobble.

Eventually I made it to Glencar and called it a day. At that point the leg and foot were too sore and I was over the moon to complete 44km and 1300m of elevation with a busted ankle.

If you are familiar with the Speedgoat 5 GTX, then this is identical except for the collar. I'm seriously considering trying to run in them for the next off-road race that I do. They also have the huge advantage that your socks don't get wet compared to the normal Speedgoats if you wade small streams.

Hopefully V6 is just as good, but if it isn't maybe stockpile these now as the discounts are impressive.
