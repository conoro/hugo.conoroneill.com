<div style="clear: both" />Forget 100K for Celebrity Love Island; Oscar finally got the 10 Euro for his first place in Juniors/Seniors writing in the Bandon Show. The following is an  exceprt from his winning entry:"Pine nut, which is a nut, but it's also the name of a town. Pistachio nut. Red pistachio nut. Natural, all natural white pistachio nut."

This balanced his unfortunate lack of awards at the Crossmahon Sports day yesterday. The competition in the Senior Infants category was just too tough and his mid-placing in both running and muscial chairs may have scarred him for life.

To make matter worse, Oisín had a cruciate ligament injury in the tiny tots running category and had to withdraw half-way to receive emergency fizzy cola bottle treatment.

Despite the lack of a prizes for bouncy castle bouncing, Sibéal put in a world-class showing and was rewarded with burger-bites and a swig of rola-cola.

And for the second weekend in succession, we shall not mention Conor's burnt slap-head.
