Well [Bandon Film Society](http://bandonfilmsociety.blogspot.com/) has gone and done it again with this brilliant idea.

In association with Partnership for Change they are organising a Special Christmas Charity Screening for Bandon Flood Appeal on Wednesday 30th December 2009 in St Peters Church, Bandon at 8pm

The movie is one of my top 5 of all time, The Princess Bride, starring the angelic Robin Wright.

If you don't live in Bandon, get into your car and drive here for this. If you don't live in Ireland, fly here. The recent showing of the original Phantom of The Opera in St Peter's was a tour-de-force.

Not only will you enjoy a genius movie but you'll be helping by contributing to the Irish Red Cross and St Vincent De Paul.
