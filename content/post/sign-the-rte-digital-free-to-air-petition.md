As a lot of you know, you can get a Digital version of RTÉ (including Widescreen) on Sky Digital and NTL. However you must have a Sky/NTL subscription to see it. Many people, including myself, believe this is fundamentally wrong as we already support RTÉ through the mandatory TV licence. 

Please [sign the petition](http://www.petitiononline.com/rte2fta/petition.html) from [Brian Greene](http://rte2fta.com/) demanding that RTE make digital broadcasts of their programming available for "free". If you are a blogger, consider adding [the badge](http://www.rte2fta.com/code.html) in support.

Whilst I'm at it, maybe someone can tell me why I was talking to RTE about Digital Terrestrial TV in 1998 and we still don't have it? RTÉ is another taxpayer funded organisation in dire need of a good kicking.
