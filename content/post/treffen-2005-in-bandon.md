The Honda Goldwing Owners Club had their annual Treffen in Bandon last weekend. It was a thrill to see so many fabulous bikes from all over Europe around the town. I could make a crack about the fact that the owners all seemed to be overweight middle-aged men, but as I now fall firmly in that category, I shall desist.

They did a parade on Saturday afternoon and we caught them on the return leg as they headed back to the camp in the GAA pitch. I took a few piccies quickly which are below and I also used the "movie" feature of the Ixus 400 to grab some video. This is quite possibly the worst quality video ever posted on a blog. Check it out below. 

The boys were hugely impressed by the cool bikes, particularly the trikes and the ones with side-cars. On our drive from Wilton to Bandon on Sunday morning, we had to wind down the window and let Ois√≠n wave at every single bike that we passed.

Events like this are great for a town and hopefully this will encourage more Clubs to come here. Porsche 911 Owners Club - any interest?
