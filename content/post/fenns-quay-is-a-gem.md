This won't be a long review, it doesn't need to be. Fenn's Quay gave us a fantastic meal last Saturday night with wonderful service in a lovely room. You can't ask for more than that.

My lovely parents were down in Cork for the weekend for the GAA thingy and offered to bring Catherine and me out for a meal. We'd heard great things about Fenn's Quay from my sister and Julian Alubaidy and, wanting somewhere new to us, booked it.

Luckily we found parking at the door of the Mardyke and walked the few yards to the unassuming door. Inside was quite large and broken into two rooms. The service from the very first minute was friendly, light-hearted and helpful, exactly the way I like it.

I was thrilled to see they were quite busy for the entire night but that didn't impact on us at all. The menu had something for everyone but for whatever reason we all picked fish mains and 3/4 picked fish starters.

To go with the meal, diligent wine-student Catherine picked a lovely Sancerre which improved quickly with opening.

I need say little more other than to highlight that this is in the top tier of restaurants in the country and if you are in Cork it should be top of your list to try. Whilst other local establishments appear to be resting on their laurels, Fenn's Quay isn't letting-up for a minute. The pictures can do the rest of the talking.
