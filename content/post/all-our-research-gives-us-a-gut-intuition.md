Another memorable quote from "The Apprentice, Martha Stewart".

On a completely unrelated topic, [Digg ](http://digg.com/)has gone to Version 3\. Digg is a news site whose top stories are voted into position by the users. Up until now it was mainly tech but they have branched out in V3\. 

I've never used it much as it causes total information overload. But the [Diggnation Podcast](http://revision3.com/diggnation) with Alex and Kevin is hysterically funny.

I had a quick look today just to see what had changed. There was [an interesting story on Digg User stats](http://digg.com/tech_news/Statistics_on_Digg_Users) - 94% male. Feign shock.

One commenter wondered what sites female internet users read instead. I am gobsmacked that the suggested one is not a live web-sites. I think they'd make a fortune:

And now back to Martha.
