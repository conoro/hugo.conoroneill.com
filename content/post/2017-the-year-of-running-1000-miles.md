2017 was probably the year I stopped feeling odd when calling myself a runner. I achieved a bunch of new things in running, including my first 50k, and managed to do just over 1000 miles for the year.

## Start running now

If you are thinking of taking up running in the new year, go for it. No excuses. Forget about "I'll wait until I've lost some weight" or "when the weather improves" or "my knee is a bit twingey". Go to a running shop now, buy a pair of runners in the new year sales along with a running top, running shorts and socks and you're ready (or just wear some sweatpants and a t-shirt). If money is tight, check out all of the cheap own-brand Kalenji gear on [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.ie/) or sales on [Wiggle](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/)/[SportsShoes](https://www.sportsshoes.com/)/[SportsPursuit](https://www.sportpursuit.com/).

Then start running.

If running alone bothers you, find a local [parkRun](http://www.parkrun.ie/) and get out every Saturday morning. Or see if there is a [Fit4life club](http://www.athleticsireland.ie/clubs/fit4life/find-a-fit4life-club) in your area.

Hopefully my 2017 stats will give you some encouragement. Well maybe not the speed aspect :-) Everything below was done whilst weighing north of 220lbs, 5ft 10ish and aged 48/49. So not [Eliud Kipchoge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2ZLG-Fij_4) or [Kilian Jornet](https://youtu.be/gGf3p6ZvRI4?t=55).

## What I ran in

* Skechers GoRun 5 - Love these. Very fast. But feet/toes suffer at marathon distances if you are slow/heavy
* Hoka One One Clifton - Love these. Fabulous cushion. A bit heavy. Narrow but ok. Great for very long distances.
* Inov-8 X-CLAW 275 - Love these. Perfect for boggy muddy Irish off-road running.
* Altra Paradigm 1.5 - Like these. Old. Treadmill only. Great cushion. Terrible heel cup.
* Altra Lone Peak 3.0 - Like these. Medium cushion. Good for forest paths and some road. Useless in full-on Irish mud.

## Weight Loss

7 lbs :-(

## Aims for 2018

I have a few things I want to achieve in 2018

* Run almost every day
* Run a lot more off-road
* Get good at running up and down mountains/hills
* Lose an enormous amount of weight
* Complete my first 50 mile Ultra
* Do the Chicago Marathon
