<div style="clear:both;"></div>I've seen plenty of mentions of the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/) but I only just tried it for the first time today. Bloody ell! Put in [www.conoroneill.com](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://conoroneill.com) and it gives old snapshots of my web-site going back to 2001\. You can never leave your mistakes behind. I was disappointed tho that the old Integral Design web-site was never archived. It would have been fun to look back at that awful spinning gold 3-D integration symbol I put on our very first web-page in '96\. Now, who else shall I look for on my lunch break?
