My sense of my readership based on the comments is that the majority are non-technical non-bloggers so I thought I'd post some stats on blogging in gerneral as it is unlikely you read [Dave Sifry's blog](http://www.sifry.com). Dave is CEO of [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/), the main blog search engine and the company responsible for things like the tags you see at the end of my posts and [microformats](http://microformats.org), the technology we're building our business, [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/) on. So statto geeks, here's a summary of what the blogosphere looks like right now [according to Dave](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000493.html):

> *   70 million weblogs
> *   About 120,000 new weblogs each day, or...
> *   1.4 new blogs every second
> *   3000-7000 new splogs (fake, or spam blogs) created every day
> *   Peak of 11,000 splogs per day last December
> *   1.5 million posts per day, or...
> *   17 posts per second
> *   Growing from 35 to 75 million blogs took 320 days
> *   22 blogs among the top 100 blogs among the top 100 sources linked to in Q4 2006 - up from 12 in the prior quarter
> *   Japanese the #1 blogging language at 37%
> *   English second at 33%
> *   Chinese third at 8%
> *   Italian fourth at 3%
> *   Farsi a newcomer in the top 10 at 1%
> *   English the most even in postings around-the-clock
> *   Tracking 230 million posts with tags or categories
> *   35% of all February 2007 posts used tags
> *   2.5 million blogs posted at least one tagged post in February

Well I bloody thought it was interesting. Off to my bed.
