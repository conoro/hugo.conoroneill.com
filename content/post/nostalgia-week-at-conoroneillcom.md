Given that this blog is six years old this week and [we've started reminiscing about the good old days of Engineering in Merrion Street and Earlsfort Terrace](http://conoroneill.com/2007/04/11/universities-belong-inside-cities/#comment-62217), I've decided that it's officially Nostalgia Week here at O'Neill Towers. 

Knarf reminded me of Jimmy Jamjars at the gates to Merrion Street. Catherine reminded me of The Jimmy Jamjar Awards. I think Teresa won one in 1991 for the largest number of PFOs of any Engineering student.

I nominate our pop-rivetted aluminium boxes which ended up holding bog-roll in Merrion Street as a candidate for best re-use ever.
