[Denise Cox](http://www.newsweaver.co.uk/emailnewsletters/) has let me know that a new Film Society is being organised in Bandon. I don't have any of the details yet but if you are interested, fire an SMS over to [Declan Waugh](http://www.photogalleryireland.com/) at 086-3853363\. I'll post an update when I hear more.
