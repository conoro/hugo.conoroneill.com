*   Wossey improved. Gervais funny as ever and John Travolta not bad. FFed throught Gareth Gates and Macy Grey. Wedding Belles good. QOTSA rules [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/16303431)
*   Read that O'Leary to be a judge on X Factor. Gutted to find out it was Dermot and not Michael. Now that could have been a great programme! [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/16488541)
*   The Read/WriteWeb article on Irish webapps made it to the front page of Digg! Hazzah. [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/16490161)
*   Do my blog readers love/hate/not_bovvered about the summary tweets which appear every day over on conoroneill.com? [#](http://twitter.com/conoro/statuses/16497571)
