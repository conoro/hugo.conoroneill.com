<div style="clear:both;"></div>From yesterday's ElectricNews:

----------------
Irish company Vordel, the XML web services security company, announced the appointment of German firm, SHE-IT as a reseller of its XML security software in the German marketplace. SHE-IT has a strong reputation for delivering security systems integration expertise to leading companies in the financial services, telecoms and industrial sectors in Germany, Vordel claimed.

Anyone else have an image in their head of a southern US good old boy stubbing his toe,  spitting out some chewing tobacco and swearing "she-it", probably followed by "goddam".
