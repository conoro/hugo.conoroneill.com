The parents are in Spain and my mother gave me a shout to see if I wanted anything whilst she was there. The last time she got me a fab selection of Chorizo and Salami which I am still working through. So I just asked for the same again. But I also asked her if she would keep her eye out for Smoked Paprika - the main flavour in Chorizo. Fiona failed to find it on her last trip and I'm beginning to think that someone will have to find a  spice emporium  over there. Bit of a coincidence that one of the foodie blogs that I read ([Chocolate and Zucchini](http://chocolateandzucchini.com) - a great read if a little high-falutin) has [a full post on Piment&oacute;n de la Vera](http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2005/09/pimentn_de_la_vera.php) which is exactly what I asked my Ma to look out for. Fingers crossed.

On a vaguely related note, anyone know if you can buy the Weber Bullet BBQ Smoker in Ireland? Some day I am going to try to BBQ a full Brisket (14lbs of it!) just like this: [Brisket Midnight Cook](http://www.virtualweberbullet.com/brisket2.html)

Last year on a business trip to Austin TX, I was brought to [The Salt Lick ](http://www.saltlickbbq.com/)by Tim Dell. I can still remember the taste of the BBQ Brisket, and the smoked turkey, and the sausage. Oh, I think I need to lie down for a second. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

After I came back I tried to BBQ a small  Irish  brisket of 2 lbs or so. I utterly incinerated it but it was bloody tasty!
