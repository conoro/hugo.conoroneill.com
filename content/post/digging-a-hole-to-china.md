[This site has been around for ages](http://map.pequenopolis.com/) but I only discovered it today. It is a Google Maps mashup that allows you to click anywhere in the world and then it shows you where you would come out on the other side of the world if you dug straight down. I was stunned to see that you come out near New Zealand if you dig from Ireland. Many a childhood sleepless night for nothing.
