Today's [Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.ie/) Question is "**What’s the next gadget that you want to buy?**"

The next gadget I buy hasn't been created yet. It'll be when Nokia take the N95 and the N810 and merge them into one product. 

This:

plus this:

It will have:

*   Quad Band Phone
*   5MP Camera with xenon flash
*   HSDPA 3G Data
*   Wifi
*   Bluetooth
*   Stereo Bluetooth Audio
*   GPS
*   Touch Screen
*   Slide Out Keyboard
*   Run a variant of Linux
*   TV Out
*   Accelerometer
*   Massive Battery
*   Take massive memory cards
*   Offer full PDA functionality and sync with both desktop apps like Outlook and online apps like Goog Calendar
*   A music player designed for podcasts (remember last spot, bookmark, speedy seek within track)
*   VOIP
*   SIP
*   the same dimensions as the N810
*   A price tag of less than €400

I don't ask for much really, do I? Actually, this device would make me the ultimate "mobile warrior". The need for a laptop would almost disappear for a lot of my travel and I would have a swiss-army penknife of gadget functionality.
