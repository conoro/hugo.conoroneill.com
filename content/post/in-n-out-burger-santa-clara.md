After my SF disaster of driving up, failing to get parking and driving back to Santa Clara, I grumpily decided to check out In-n-Out Burger for once and for all. This is California's most famous burger chain and many burger fanatics rave about it.

The decor is 50's kitsch and works well. Service was friendly as with nearly everywhere in the US, even if I sometimes feel that Texans really mean it when Californians just say it. But he did miss half my order which was a bit annoying. The In-n-Out bit was a misnomer as I then had to wait ten minutes to actually get the food. The value was great - a "Double Double" burger, fries and a shake for just over $5.

Is it the greatest burger ever? Nah, but as fast food goes it is pretty bloody good. Juicy, tasty meat, a good bun and a great sauce. Excellent crispy fries and a lovely shake. Head and shoulders above a Micky D's or Burger King.

Not worth flying to California for but I left with a nice full belly and a warm glow.

Whilst I am at it, the three other places we ate:
Applebees, McCarthy Ranch- pretty crap but edibleish
Tomatina, Mission College Blvd - excellent pizza and Sam Adams
La Pastaia, downtown San Jose - good Italian food but empty
