For some completely bizarre reason, each regional health board can decide whether to give babies a [BCG](http://www.immunisation.ie/en/ChildhoodImmunisation/BCG/) shot or not as standard. Cork (all of Munster?) is the only region not to. 

Catherine has just pointed me to a story in [The Irish Examiner](http://www.irishexaminer.ie/irishexaminer/pages/story.aspx-qqqg=ireland-qqqm=ireland-qqqa=ireland-qqqid=28504-qqqx=1.asp) about a woman with TB who worked in two creches in Cork. They are now going to have to test every child in both of those locations for infection. 

Other than saving a few quid in the short term, is there any medical reason not to provide it? How would you feel if your kid got TB because some paper pusher in the health service decided Cork people don't need protecting? Maybe they'd like us all to return to the days of Seán Ó Riordáin living in a shed in the garden writing poetry? "Mar is poll im cheann gach smaoineamh......and the TB ain't so hot either mum".
