We finally made it down to our first St Patrick's Day Parade in Bandon. The kids really enjoyed it (2 year old loved the tractors and fire engines). I was a bit surprised how short it was and the person beside me mentioned the lack of music. Face painting and balloon shapes went down very well. I wish I'd managed to see all the old cars as the pristine Escort (Mexico?) looked fantastic from a distance.

I noticed the Scouts were allowed wear jackets. In my day in Kilkenny we didn't even have jumpers :-)

Here's a few photos and videos:
