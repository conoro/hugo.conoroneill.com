Catherine FitzMaurice from [Kilbrogan House](http://www.kilbrogan.com) just contacted me about an awesome night that is happening as part of the Engage Arts festival over the weekend of Sep 25th.

They are showing the 1925 version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with, and this is the genius bit, live organ accompaniment by Dr Eric Sweeney who is head of Music at Waterford School of Technology. Not only that, but they are showing it in a church. The atmosphere should be amazing!

It's on in St Peter's Church, Bandon on  Friday, 25th September at  9pm. The film runs for 90mins. Tickets are only â‚¬10 and I think they are going to sell out well before time. Call the office on 087-1205022 or Film Society on 086-3689939.
