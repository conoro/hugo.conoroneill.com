But when I did, I laughed out loud.&nbsp;Courtesy of [marketing guru Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/08/human_beings_ha.html).

&nbsp;Human beings have short memories: German appliance maker [Bosch introduces the Axxisâ„¢ washer](http://www.universal-akb.com/boschwashers.html). 

On the topic of marketing, we spotted a sign for a restaurant on the way back from Killarney yesterday. It said "Muesli Restaurant, Vegetarian Italian". 

I can't think of a better way&nbsp;to ensure you get zero customers than to include the word muesli in your ad.

An&nbsp;alternative might be &nbsp;"Warm gravel, Italian with all the good bits taken out"
